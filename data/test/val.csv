Is that alright? or Okay. Keeps coming off. 'S fiddly. Right. Oh  another one. Ah. Very nice. 'Kay. Okay. Clip. Ah. It's an elephant. Oh my gosh  I'm never gonna be able to draw that well. Does it? Oh. Mm. I have no idea what my favourite animal is. Oh. It's A what? Alright. How. No. Great. Me? Okay. Not quite sure how this is gonna work. Cool. Uh well I'll try my best to draw. Can I just draw the face? Ooh. It's a cat. Which also has what? A big fat body and big and a long tail. Why? Because um cuddly. And usually cats are very friendly. Usually. And they're healing as well. They heal. And they can feel when a human's got problems so So  that's why I like cats. There we are  that's me. Mm. Mm-hmm. Ah. Market range internationally sold. Ah right okay. Yeah. Yeah. Uh. Yeah. Yeah it's a T_V_ remote control. Well. A new remote control for T_V_. What would I like? Um. Medium. Mm. Twelve fifty. Each. Guess Couldn't we have like one that comes out? Like so you have one in like mm it doesn't have to be really thick. I mean remote controls can be thin bits. And then you have one for your D_V_D_ and you sort of slide it out  and then you have another one  you slide it out. have slides. And then it all comes compact into one. So it's not you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner  and um into one basically. So you just flip them out. That would be cool. I was thinking that like a flip. Okay. Um.. But what'll make it what'll make it interesting for people to buy though? I mean if it's if it's just like Mm-hmm. Mm. I think a flip up thing  'cause you always have this problem of like if it's on this well I did anyway  like we had five or six remotes and they would be lying on the c on the coach  and you'd come and sit down and ooh  the telephone's the television switched on or something. So maybe something that like does have a lid or closes  so you don't accidentally press a button or record button for something. Yeah. But make it like really snazzy and cool people will want it. So make it Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. And even for kids as well. It's um it's safer for them  I guess. Like they don't flick onto channels and all that sl flick onto. Mm. W What does I_D_V_I_D_N_M_E_ stand for? Ah ri okay. these are requirement specification. And I'm marketing. These are requirement specification. So what the user requires in a remote. I guess that's what it says. Mm. So  do we take these off? Yeah. The back end of an elephant. Aesthetic yep  sure. 'Kay  my favourite animal  uh let's see. Dunno if any of you have seen Napoleon Dynamite before. It's a liger  a combination of a lion and tiger. Have you not seen Napoleon Dynamite? Oh it's a hilarious movie. You have to see it. And and it's best characteristic is it's pretty much the awesomest animal. But you have to see the movie to fully appreciate it. There go. A prairie dog? Oh a squirrel? Yeah  that's pretty good. Alright. So I think before we close uh  we are expected I mean the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer what our what our ideas where. I mean if you wanna go back to the last slide. Uh S Yeah  I think we're I mean before we close the meeting  we're supposed to come up with some ideas for Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  I think this is just the preliminary  get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls have been and and what we would roughly what we would incorporate into a new one maybe. Yeah  I think we've all got Mm. Yeah it seems like there's like there's sort of a tension between two ideas  I mean  you want you want one remote that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of T_V_ and if you have whatever associated with T_V_ the D_V_D_ player  or something like that  but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something. Mm. Yeah. It g can't be more than twelve fifty per unit. Cost. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not sure if that's like I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though  'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it. Oh. Oh okay. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah  we should uh I guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a a rough conception you know stage one was technical functions design  what effect the apparatus should have. Okay. Um so I mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface  but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the T_V_  but also devices connected to the to the T_V_  I mean  be able to operate D_V_D_ players  things like that. Yeah. Okay. Right. Yeah  I mean. Yeah  that's true  maybe we should just concentrate on having a a good T_V_ remote  and have it be um have it be like ergonomic so it's comfortable to use  uh simple to use  and looks decent and Sorta find a niche for our remote  like market it to a certain kind of p kind of people  certain certain demographic Yeah  no I think you're right. Yeah  rathe rather than focus on Y Yeah. Yeah. Remotes spinning out from other remotes and having little nested remotes inside. Yeah  that's true what you were saying  I mean it doesn't have to have a flip function  it can just have a lock function  so that it's not uh not usable when you don't want it to be usable. I guess that's good good for now. That's me. Okay. Right. Right. Yeah  it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap. Yeah. Alright  see you in thirty minutes. So we're 'kay? On the or No. I dunno where to put it 'cause the Okay. Could you s take it off?. Okay. Are we free to take notes uh Okay. Okay. So are we supposed to bring the little things for the Mm. Yeah. okay. So my favourite animal 'Kay um Um okay  it's big  it's got a great memory. Supposed to have a great memory  we say an elephant never forgets. And uh dunno know why but looks like nice to me. Nice animal. Okay. No. Really? Oh that's a Not bad I would say. Very good. Mm. Yeah. Is this a T_V_ one we are supposed to make? Okay. T But how do we know how much uh  I mean  how much do we have per how much? Twelve fifty. So do we have to be realistic within the budget or Close pr I don't know how much it would cost. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Um have uh one very complicated one on one side with all the D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ access and stuff  and then on the other side o one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel  program plus and minus  and the just the mute button  for example. I can real keep it really really simple on one side and the other side be very complicated. Yeah. Or grandma as well  you know it's like what is the mute button. No  but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold like you wouldn't be able to press the buttons  but Start breaking up. Yeah. Yeah. Could be really light or  I dunno  something special. Yeah  'cause at the end of the day if it says just T_V_ remote  doesn't say com combination with all all the r Mm. Okay. That's Mm. Mm. Har how it works an Bu Do you think our two kind of overlap  because Yeah. I don't Mm-hmm? Okay. Ooh. Hmm. How do we sta wa how do we start? Does anybody know? So that's this Oh okay  right. Uh.. Hmm. Okay  just hang on a second everybody. I haven't actually looked at this yet. um I haven't looked at it  but let's just start it off and we'll see what happens. If you're all ready. So is the agenda? Opening  acquaintance  tool training and project plan  discussion and then closing. Project aim is a new remote control. It's original  uh trendy and it's user-friendly. Project method  functional design  individual work  another meeting  conceptual design  individual work  and a meeting of details design  individual work and a meeting. Tool training. Try out the whiteboard  every participant should draw their favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal. Um. Uh Miss Industrial Designer  would you like to go first? Yeah  why don't you just c  I think just clip on clip do you have a belt? Or put 'em in your pocket  yeah. Yeah  what's your favourite animal? Is it rude? That's a very good elephant. 'Kay  and you want to write up on there  it says you've gotta sum up your f f your favourite characteristics of that animal. Mm. Okay. Wonderful  well done. Do you want to use the wipe the m the wiper and wipe it off? And Mister aesthetics designer do you wanna go next? No. No. Okay  well done. Yeah. Miss mar Miss Marketing? Um yeah  I think you can just draw the face  but then you'll have to describe in writing how the rest of it looks. That's a very pr pretty cat. Okay  do y do you wanna do some write you wanna just write some words about it? Wow  so they're kinda spiritual. Well done. Okay. Um  I don't actually have a favourite animal  but for the for th for this meeting I'll s draw a little Uh. I honestly can't draw for toffee. Uh. Yeah. no no uh That's exactly what it is. Uh not a very good one Okay  well  you got it's a s It's a squirrel  and I like them  because they're cute and stupid. Right. Okay  so  I guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working. Mm. Let's move on to the next page. Okay  project finance  selling price twenty five Euros  profit aim fifty million Euros. Yeah. Production cost  ah right it's gotta be can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make. experience with with remote control  so talk about who who's used what. Any ideas? Stuff like that. Next meeting starts in thirty minutes. At quarter to twelve. Yeah. Oh k so we're actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now are we or oh okay. I thought this was just t giving us instructions for the re to do next  but Okay. Right  who's got experiences with remote controls then? Pretty much everybody. Um. 'Kay um. W what You want it big do you want it small. Are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that's that's big and Video and ts hi-fi and stuff. Maybe you yeah now th that's the other thing is it's gotta be cheap. 'Cause I I I mean I was thinking something that's got different like maybe a a an L_C_D_ display on it that's got different pages for different devices  but that would p that would probably be quite expensive. Per unit  yeah. Well at the moment we could  wa I mean we 'cause we this is what we th what we're doing at the moment is just saying what what we'd like  and then after we after we've found out what we can like  some different ideas  we can then go and do the research to find out if these any of these ideas are feasible or not. So would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things. Um. 'Kay. Okay  that's. Th that's an idea. Okay. One side for kids  one side for adults. Like it or something like a flip telephone  something like that maybe. F flip it open and you've got all the buttons  or you flip it closed and you've just got the basic buttons on the outside maybe. Um  oh we've got five minutes left. But okay. Well we've got a k we've got a few ideas there. Yeah. I have got I think we should also have a back-up plan of I 'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that I mean we don't  we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything. We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control  that just that is just for a T_V_  but it's just a really good  nice one. What do you reckon? See 'cause  I'm just thinking bearing in mind th we've gotta we have to have something that's cheap to make. I think we'll be able to come up with ideas and stuff a lot quicker. Yeah. May w you know  maybe even Or maybe even so something that's for disabled people or so people that uh b don't see very well or big buttons for touchy buttons for Yeah. Or just one that looks really fucking cool. Otherwise we'll be we'll be here all day talking about do this let's do that n I think we sh I think we should Yeah. I mean obviously everyone we're uh you know uh sounds like we're all a bit sort of gadget heads and we like things that do everything at once  but you know  that's Yeah. Yeah  that's right. Yeah. I mean I'd like one that makes tea as well  but that's not gonna happen. Okay  like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones  yeah. Yeah  it's gotta be sellable. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. No porn channel for children. Okay. Um alright  so we've got some ideas  we've got um Let's move on. Oops  let's close that. Next meeting  uh okay. Industrial Designer um which is Um. Yeah  there you go. So User Interface Designer  that's that's that's you  so you gotta you go  you're you're gonna be the one that's working out what what buttons we need. Um. Industrial Designer  you are the one  you know  you're gonna be working out kind of box it goes in  I guess so  um whether it's what goes into the box  somehow. And in marketing User requirements specifications. Yeah  what Right  okay  yeah. You two you two are gonna be just  I think  you just double up  you know  you working together. You're the one that's gotta go and find out do th do the research  see what people want in a remote  what buttons are used more often  and s stuff like that. Oh  we've been warned to finish the meeting now. Okay. Okay everyone  well done. Good meeting. Yeah. ,The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting. The industrial designer discussed possible materials to use in making the case for the remote  options for buttons  and options for batteries. The interface specialist presented two existing products which incorporate features the team is seeking to embed in their remote. The interface specialist also discussed other features to possibly incorporate into the design of the remote  such as an LCD screen. The marketing expert discussed recent findings from trend watching reports and how to incorporate these findings into the remote design with respect to what materials to use and the overall appearance of the product. The team then discussed other options for how they could incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme into the appearance of their product. The team then discussed other options for batteries  chips  buttons  and materials for the case  as well as the option to have a menu function. 
Does that mean like a wind-up one? A wind-up remote. You could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike  and then people could exercise whilst watching T_V_. Yeah  and stop worrying about the whole R_S_I_ from the remote thing  'cause that's just Yay. Did you say wool? Wood. Oh right.. Yeah  you'll understand why when we get to my presenta. Sony. Sony Ericsson mobile phones has it. Mm. No it's got its little camera in there  plug it in. 'S a Ugly. Yeah  you can't Oh  it's like the iPod. G yeah  no  you can. It's like it's like where you you know how you have your your mouse  and y you go round and i it's kind of like that and you spin round and it yeah. It is You just go round and it is a bit weird at first  but it's actually very like fast. I like the the wheels that click on the side you you get 'em much slower  so it's quite good if you like searching quite a lot of stuff. Do you know  if you're lookin if you're th scrolling through the A_ to Z_ of your music and you're looking for something at T_  then it's a lot faster than the wheel  but you've got a lot less control over it. Okay  I've put the copy of the presentation in um the yeah. Cool. Fabulous. Okay  cool. Um so what I did was to search the internet to come up with market trends and you know what users are gonna be wanting in the the near future. Okay. Right. Now  the first aspect is apparently twice as important as the second aspect  which is twice as important as the third a aspect. So  I mean the the easy to use thing is fairly low down on the which I think given the target group is what you would expect  really. Um  you know  people want something new  something technologically innovative and different  so the whole idea with the L_C_D_s and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like  quite the thing to go for. And um  yeah it wants to look fancy  fancy look and feel. So Yeah  yeah. Mm. Depends how fast your television runs  really  don't don't you think? I mean we've got one of those um Telewest boxes and you put the number in the remote and then you wait and then it goes to the T_V_ and then you wait  and then it comes  so i it actually takes quite a long time. And if you get the number in wrong  then it's a bit of a pain  so I think  you know  a screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that. But like remotes do tend to get f thrown about a bit. You know? Yeah. And i it would be like I mean if you could make it integrate with the T_V_ then it could come up with new information about what's on  and you could just see that on the remote rather than Yeah. But um I think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone  you know  like you have the slidey ones and you have the flippy ones and then the screen's protected so it doesn't actually get scratched. So you can have like what looks like a normal remote control  you know or like a minimalist remote control. So you got your buttons one to nine  your on and off and your volume on that and then if you want to mess about with it  you flip it open and  yeah. Yeah  so that kind of decides your whole chip thing. Okay? Cool. Okay  apparently  fruit and vegetables will be providing inspiration. Sorry  I discovered clip art. Um so these will be an important feature for clothes  shoes and furniture. So I mean  I'm taking this to mean  you know  curviness. Do you know? 'Cause you don't tend to get flat vegetables. You know? Yeah  bit of asymmetry and stuff. But that would be a good way to to get in the whole um R_S_I_ issue in there  because I mean if you think most people use the remote control with their right hand ha right hands so you wanna you curve it so that it's suitable for use with the right hand. Um yeah  I'm not quite sure about the relevance of material will be spongy. Um Yeah  but I mean y you have to Well I suppose you wouldn't get a remote uh an electric shock off your remote control if it was made of rubber. Yeah  yeah. If it's made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there  you could just bounce it up and down. Yeah. Um so yeah  um okay. Yeah  yeah. You have to have a certain element of flatness  I think. It it depends on the whole ergonomics of it  you know  it's like how you put your hands so y it's the least movement basically. No  I d I don't think it makes a lot of difference. I I have one of those s slidey phones and I mean the back is essentially straight  but it's curvy  so. Besides  you have four sides to a thing  so I mean does curved one side mean one side is straight and  you know curved two sides means the whole thing is just a big curvy p thing? Yeah. Yeah. Uh it's it's more about the protecting the L_C_D_  which I think is where it came from. But no  my research didn't tell me anything  which is why we have all the pictures  'cause I had nothing better to do with my time. Okay  cool. Uh combine style with a level of functionality  um beauty and practicality and a thing of beauty and p function. Okay? It's about the practicality of it really  isn't it? You know? I mean if I can't imagine a m wooden remote control. Well it's not very cleanable either  do you know. It's it's not a practical I mean it's it's alright for a table  but for a remote control  you know. And splinters and stuff and It just m doesn't make any sense  I think is the thing with wood. You have to have some push-buttons  don't you? G yeah  yeah. Yeah. I think this is going back to the the graph at the beginning that I made  where  you know  the buttons that people use all the time  you want buttons for them and everything else menu-driven. Yeah. Yeah. G yeah  I would think buttons  yeah. It's it's the I think the thing is  so if someone just wants to turn on their T_V_ and put on a channel  then it should be easier to use than any other remote  and then if someone wants to  you know  change the contrast on their T_V_ and they should be able to do that and it should be accessible  but  you know  I mean most of the time I mean there's a limit to how much the biggest techno geek can spend fiddling with the T_V_  I think is the the the issue there. E either or G yeah. I would say the s the s the spinning goes at a high speed to th to the scrolling wheel  so you have to decide whether you you know  you want to be going so fast or not. But I mean the the thing with this whole if y you're planning on making it out of rubber  on the basis that it's spongy  then I'm not sure how well a scrolling wheel would work. Yeah  but y your spinning wheel tends to go to one side. You want an outside of rubber and then open it up and Or maybe like interchangeable cases. 'Cause I know like we're going back to iPods again n the whole spinning wheel  but I have like a you know  obviously my iPod's not made of rubber  but then I have a little rubber case that goes over the top of it and I can change the colour  theoretically  to match my outfit. Yeah  I think the spinning wheel is definitely very now. Yeah. That doesn't fit in with the whole vegetable theme though. Yeah  but I mean do you think we could incorporate the colours of the company into the buttons and then make the colour of the main remote the colour like vegetable colours  do you know? So you could have like I mean I suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green and some reds and um maybe purple and that and then you'd pick the buttons in company colours to to match with it. So are we discounting solar energy because rubber's gonna be used in there somewhere or If solar panels with the rubber. Yeah  okay  so we lose that I think. Yeah. It's just a gimmick. Yeah  sure j Sorry  do you want me to What does um I_C_S_ mean? Okay  cool. So it's advanced integrated circuits? Imagine it would be inside. So um actually that could like really cut down your thing  so you've got your outside  which is like minimalist  and then you open it up and you've got a screen and a spinning wheel  which you can incorporate buttons into. Um so you've still not got like a lot of stuff in the You've maybe got  you know like if you're modelling on iPod you've got five buttons and a wheel  and four of the buttons are in the wheel  and the other one's the little bit inside the wheel  yeah. Cool  I'm gonna go and sit on my own. I know  I'm hated. I've got a bit tangled up in all this. Excellent. So um I sent you the agenda  it was on the in the project documents. I don't know if you got a chance to just have a look at it. Anyway  it's the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time  so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to. Um and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with  so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts  so that's we need to know about the components' properties  materials  the user interface and any trends that the Marketing Expert has been watching. Okay. Um  do you wanna start again? Let me we've got forty minutes. You haven't made a PowerPoint  okay. Mm-hmm. Let's hope the pen holds out. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. And charging their remote  yeah. Uh yeah. Mm-hmm. For a remote  'cause you Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Wood  wood. A fluffy remote. Huh. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Excellent. Do you wanna stay somewhere near the board  so that if we need to you can sit down  but just we might need you to leap up. What are you  PowerPoint  or Okay. Do you think these pens can give you cancer of the hand? Some sort of radiation? Yeah. Right  interface concept. That's fine. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. It's yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh  hi yeah. It's like the like you said  no? The scroll scroll wheel. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Excellent. Okay  straight to trends  and then we can discuss it all at once. The project documents. Excellent. If you two could both do that as well  in case we need to refer to it. Here it comes. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah  yeah  sure. Yeah. That's over on the interface  if if you could put Yeah. And maybe the L_C_D_ and spinning so that means we need an advanced thing. Mm-hmm. Mm. It it is also quite nice though to to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen  so if you're watching something Yeah. Rather than having to interrupt your viewing pleasure. Mm. Yeah. And then you can flip it open. Yeah  I think so. Yeah. Right. Yeah  and possibly even uneven  like not not symmet yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Something a bit squishy and Yeah  and it'd help if you drop it  it protects it as well. To some degree. Uh-huh. Or if we want to use the the latex  then we have to go with one of the other um power things. From from bouncing it. You can have it as like a little ball to bounce  that flips open. Mm yeah. Uh-huh. Mm. Yeah  'cause the Yeah. Dunno. Nothing to open them. Anything else? What've we got? Okay  so. Looking at what we've got  we we want an L_C_D_ display with a spinning wheel. Yeah  rub off some of those. Yeah  it's not that's not streamlined and sexy  having a having a wind up. I think tha Depends how much how much movement it really needs. Pr presumably if they're suggesting it  then we could use it. I'd I'd keep it on. We don't want that it's no it's not not vegetable. Mm. Mm. Yeah  and given that we're we're looking at more spongy material preferences  I ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Just for fast Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it yeah L_ L_C_D_. Do we need them on as buttons or do we need them as L_C_D_? Buttons. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's what you guys are gonna do next  so if we put down the key um things that we want. Just spinning and not scrolling  I would say. Yeah. Hmm. But if you've got a if if you've got a flipped thing  effectively it's something that's curved on one side and flat on the other side  but you folded it in half. Th that would be on one side  uh-huh. No  I think it's just the casing rubber on the outside. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Mm-hmm. That's right  that's what they're after. Mm-hmm. I guess. Bananas. Mm-hmm. Green. Yeah. We need the advanced yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. That was the We can't have solar panels with rubber  so. Shall we go for if we're going for rubber  we think uh on as our case  and then Yeah. We've got five more minutes. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah  mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost  then I'd put them in  but if it's Yeah. It's from the company  so Yeah. Okay. And the case is curved on one side  but then flat flat  so it's flipped into each other. Can I pull the thing out the back of your computer? Just so we can Nothing  it's right  I'm just There we go. Uh oh now I've gone too far. Yeah. We're on our way. Okay. So we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery  the advanced chip and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself  um made out of rubber and the buttons are also rubber. We're having push-buttons on the outside and then on the inside an L_C_D_ with spinning wheel  and we're incorporating voice recognition. That's our overall concept  and it's gonna look sort of vegetable  and be in bright vegetable colours. I think it's on the Mm-mm. Yeah. On the Mm-hmm. In the centre  yeah  sure. Okay  so now we've got thirty minutes before our next meeting. In the meantime  the Industrial Designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design  which I'll presume he'll work out what that means. Um the User Interface Designer will work on the user interface design and the Marketing Expert is going to work on product evaluation. And as well as that  the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we've just come up with using modelling clay and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach. Is that all okay? And anyone who hasn't put their their presentation in the project documents folder  it would be good just so in case we have to refer to it. Y ah nobody wants to talk to you. Unplug yourself. I dunno  maybe I would car So what was what was this k ka Okay. Mm-hmm. Um you mean this would be like the the overall shape of the remote control  yeah  mm-hmm. Yeah  mm-hmm  mm-hmm. Mm-hmm mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Um I have some PowerPoint  yeah. Oh. 'Kay. Okay. Okay. Um to be honest actually  I mentioned some some of the things which which could fit on the on the this talk um this time  I m I mentioned them already in the previous talk. So um yeah  this time um I might not have them on the slides but I I can just mention them aw again. Okay. So um I thought um I would also include the definition of user interface um so it's the aspects of a of of a computer system or programme which can be seen uh by the user um and and which uh the mechanisms that the user uses to control its operation and input data. So this would p includes things like shape and size and buttons and um voice recognition as well  and colour  and so on. Um um the method I employed this time was a again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet and then um analyse them uh from the point of view of user fen friendliness and also um whether their appearance was was pleasant. Um and then um this uh this um this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product. So some findings um um. So in in the case of many user interfaces  they're just so full of buttons that it's actually uh hard to find the ones you you really um want to use and um and it's just confusing  it takes y know time to learn. Um okay  and I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found. Okay  some of them are here. Um well the picture is not very clear  but as you can see  there are actu oi  oh oh oh  sorry for that. 'S go back. Ah  no  please. Okay  so yeah  they're quite big and have many many buttons. Actually of the of all these I personally p prefer this one  because it's it's the smallest and and with with least uh with the smallest number of buttons as well. And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice. Um okay. So let's carry on with this. Um So uh um o other findings um some new things um used  uh some of them were mentioned already by our Technical um Designer uh. Our own company has developed a new in user interface uh wait  no this is not the one. Okay  there is a we can uh include voice recognition and um it allows i it's possible to record eighty different voice samples on it. Uh so uh this uh this one was already mentioned uh the L_C_ display. Um s another new development is a scroll button  which was also th also already mentioned. And uh our own manufacturing division ha has uh designed a new um uh programmable speech uh mm sorry uh speaker unit I guess it's it should be. Um and this means that um once uh uh it it it comes together with a voice recognition  but it's once once the mm um gadget uh recognises uh the voice of the speaker  there can be a um pre-programmed answer  for example  you can pick up the remote control and say something to it like hello and it says some hello and your name or whatever. So I mean this is also one of the n dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include. No no  the scroll button is a different thing. I I have a picture if you just a moment  I'll I'll show you. I wasn't completely sure myself  but I think it's just like um it's it's a wheel  it's like not separate buttons. Look  this one here. But I'm I'm not really sure whether whether you can really turn it round  it's like you press this or this or Uh-huh. Mm. Uh Okay  and the personal preferences are pretty much the same as as as last time. It it has to be small  simple. Okay  we decided to include voice recognition  so to have the standard uh major buttons like on  off  um ch the channels and and then um volume and then the rest would be a menu on the screen. Um and I I also thought uh if we want to keep it small and nice um and actually I I quite like the idea of a scroll a scrolling button  I thought it could be for for voice like  I dunno  it mm like on a um i like it used to be on Walkmans or something. There is uh I think there is no reason why we couldn't use something like this for for the remote control. So yeah  that's uh that's it. Yep  yeah. Mm-hmm. So it could be like a rubbery yeah  uh-huh. Thanks Yeah uh-hum yeah. Yeah it's yeah. N wood is I can't n how do you uh I mean you can't keep it really small uh you can't make it like thin and The wood thing. Because you need to you n you need to put all the technology in  so I mean if the case you add the case and it it becomes a bit bulky wi mm-mm yeah. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. U yeah wood is not really yeah. Yeah. Yeah  yeah  in the case of remote control not really. Yeah  but you um I think for for the channel numb uh channel numbers you still need them  wouldn't you? Yeah  so for channel numbers but But I th yeah but I think the L_C_D_ display is kind of yeah  it's faster with a m yeah and w if we dis and when we s um discussed that we might like this flipping open thing  then I mean y you can use it as a normal remote control  but if you do want to use L_C_D_  then you flip it open  but it's it it's more time-consuming. Yeah. No  no  I mean mm we we definitely need the the numbers  because it's uh otherwise people don't want to flip through all the channels. Um Yeah  I would say buttons  because it's yeah. I Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah but n I I'm not completely um completely clear uh I yeah  about the spinning wheel. So I think it it doesn't make sense to have both like a scrolling and spinning thing  it's uh you can al include everything in the spinning if you yeah  yeah  in that case. Ah  but I mean you can Yeah  I um I think so too  I mean the case would be yeah the case would be rubber and the the buttons  rubber buttons  but then Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah I think we um it was a a requirement that we use our um th the colours of our company  so would it be like yellow  grey and black or something  or Yeah  does Yeah. Banana's yellow  yeah  definitely. Mm-hmm. And the buttons as well  I think. Yeah. Yeah  but it it I think it should be quite cheap because it's from our own company  yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Um Uh-huh. So w w would with have the spinning wheel inside with the L_C_D_  or would it be on the outer Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah  okay. Mm-hmm. Mm yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Hmm. So but shall I move away first or shall I stay here with we need to Right. Okay. Right s so I haven't made a PowerPoint presentation  yeah  I I thought I'll use the whiteboard instead. Um mm  okay  so basically I'll start off by uh I thought I'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options and what we can do is that we can start um uh rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that uh are m or highlighting or underlining them or something like that. Okay  so uh I'll start again with a brief introduction to connect that anyway brief introduction to the insides of a remote control and uh then we can probably uh discuss the various components. Yeah. Okay  so w what you see here is so this is the outside of the remote  right? If you open it  you have a circuit board here  right  and this is the chip that I was talking about last time. This basically sends information to a tr uh transistor here  which then uh sends the information to an L_E_D_ device here. If you flip the printed circuit board  and this is th the most important point here  uh everything else is kind of Okay  so if you flip the circuit board  this is what it looks like. So you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the P_C_B_ and uh on pressing this button I a circuit completes  the information goes to the chip  which is somewhere here and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation  which goes goes out through there. So uh the important point that I read over the website was uh that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards uh are quite cheap to make  you can ge get them printed as you want to  so w we can have a configuration um irrespective of the cost  the way we want to have. Right? So that's the important point here  so these are the different options that we have. Okay. So the batteries  I'll start with the battery  right? So they can be simple which is like uh the normal batteries in uh our uh the cells  yeah? Uh thes these are the kind different kind of batteries that the company makes  right? So. And dynamos. Um yeah  yeah. So uh I don't know if even if you want to consider this  but these are the different things that the company makes  so th they'll they'll since uh they'll come internally from the company  they'll be eas uh cheaper  uh all these options. So the third one is uh the kinetic energy ones. Yeah. Yeah  it's a good option. The the kinetic energy one is uh that e uh uh they are usually modern watches  since our hand keeps moving  it keeps the watch ticking. But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control  because it'll just lie there for a long while sometimes. But as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it uh re recharges or something. And the fourth option is the solar cells  which are also made by the company. Environment friendly. Okay um so I'll list things and then we can come back and discuss what what we think from uh everybody's perspective. There are different cases that can be provided. They can be basically the shape of the cases  they can be flat  they can be curved with uh one-sided curved and one side flat  and they can be curved with on both the sides. These are the three options  right? Um Yeah  would it be flat on both the sides  would be curved from one side  or whatever uh there were different kind of supplements available  um like it can be in plastic  rubber  wood  or titanium  right? Wo wo wood. Yeah. Not wool. Oh really? Okay. Um the so uh we can use even um a certain titanium is also used uh in the company to make uh uh some space design equipment  so it's kind of um uh it'll be probably nicer to use  because it relates to the overall image of the company  but uh it cannot be used on a double curved surface. If we choose this  we cannot use titanium. For for these two we can use titanium  wood  rubber  or plastic. Yeah? Uh okay  the interface options now. So we can have push-buttons  like most remotes do and our company is an expert in making push-buttons. Ooh. Uh we can have scroll wheels like the ones on um uh mouse pointers uh uh Yeah  yeah  something like that. So  and they have they can even have an an integrated uh push-button inside the scrolling thing. The scroll plus push. So this is something that has been recently developed by the company  um in the last decade  so not too recent. And L_C_D_s  we can have L_C_D_s. So these two are recent and and this is q quite old. The various electronic options are um uh so th this concerns firs first of all the the chips I I showed you at uh so there's there's a chip behind this one  right? The P_C_B_ is uh inexpensive  so we can put put in uh whatever we want  but the various integrated circuit options are  we have either a simple one or a regular or advanced. And uh the price goes up as we go down  obviously. Um okay  so the good thing about uh wh wh why why we would want to use advanced u why we might want to use advanced is that L_C_D_s can only come with the advanced chip. Um the we need regular or advanced for uh scroll wheels. Right? Um and the chip basically includes the infra infrared sender. Yeah. Uh besides this in electr under electronics uh also the company has started making a sample sender  which is did not explained what i what it was  but I'm guessing that uh so they have a sample sender and a sample speaker. So I'm guessing that uh the sample speaker is probably something like um uh you know  as soon as you press a button  it it mm uh give gives you feedback  one five or whatever. Yeah  on. Um and uh I dunno whether sample sender sender has to do something with voice recognition or not  but anyway. So  these are the different options that we have. Okay  so th that's that's basically now now uh I think that uh we can integrate um uh you know  uh the user interface uh and uh the marketing things in that  keep uh taking out things from this and uh underlining things that are important  yeah. Yeah  yeah  sure. Sure. Yeah. Right. Yeah  it should should do it. Yeah. That's nice one. Mm. Mm. Uh sorry  uh can you go back for a second? Um uh are you sure wha what this means  a spinning wheel with the L_C_ display? Uh oh yeah are th Oh okay  the iPod thing  yeah. Uh it's the iPod uh kind of uh Alright  right. Okay  okay. So instead of going down you just spin yeah  yeah. Uh-huh. Right. Mm-hmm. Right. So maybe I should include that here as well  L_C_D_s um plus spinning. Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. So um uh maybe uh as you're discussing things  is it okay if we just uh keep highlighting things here? Right. So mm uh so it yeah  so probably voice recognition is is kind of important  right? Um and an yeah. Okay  I I have a point about L_C_D_  I dunno if it is the right point to take it up. W uh L_C_D_s are basically for feedback  right  to the user who's pressing buttons  and the feedback can come through television itself  so do we need an L_C_D_ on the remote? Mm. Right. Right. That's true  yeah  that's also Right. Mm-hmm. Mm right. Okay. So now we seem to have a consensus that L_C_D_s are definitely the way to go because of style and Right. You you agree? Maarika  yeah? Yeah. So L_C_D_s  yeah  definitely. Go on. Mm-hmm. Right. Mm. Yeah  we we have we have rubber  but there is a problem that I forgot to discuss with the um with using So if if we use uh latex cases  they won't allow us to use solar cells  as an energy source that is the constraint  so um we could use titanium  wood or plastic uh or uh Yeah  w energy source. Yeah  tap it on the desk  yeah. Mm. So probably double curved surface is the way to go  yeah . Or or curved at one end and flat on the top  because I I'm not sure if it is flat on both both the sides  then ho how much easy would it be to reach for buttons  etcetera. Um Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  singe single side curved or double side curved does not say too much  does it? It uh Mm. Uh I think uh Right. Right. Di now did it say anywhere in your research material about this sliding stuff uh because um according to the information that I have  I think uh the onl only options that we have with the case is are these three. Uh eith either we have uh a flat surfaced uh case or a curved surfaced case. It does not say anything about uh whether technically  you know  this this stuff is available at all. Right  yeah  yeah. Right. Okay. Cool  thanks. Yeah. Let's let's try to r rub off things and yeah  so um hand dynamos are definitely out  right? You you got a wind dynamo  yeah. Okay. Um kinetic energy does seem to have some kind of uh uh appeal  but uh it's Yeah. As against a watch  which constantly keeps moving  this this thing will have to be tapped every time  which which might be very frustrating for the user. Kinetic energy it needs I don't have too much technical information on that  yeah  right. Okay  let's keep it option uh keep an option  yeah. Um the flat co completely flat case is definitely out  right? It has to be at least curved from one side  yeah. Um okay  we still have all all the options. Wood  do you think wood will be a good idea? Mm. Right. Yeah if if it is really thin if it is really thin it it's likely to break  it's it's much more uh Right. That's true. Yeah. Yeah  okay wood is out. Right. Okay  now for the really interesting stuff  the interface. Right  so uh the the push-buttons is is our expertise uh in the industry  but uh it seems to be out of trend  you know  nobody seems to be Mm right. Oh  if if we have L_C_D_ displays  that opens up a whole world  you know  if you have an L_C_D_ display  then mm you can select almost everything on the L_C_D_ display. Right. Okay. Mm right. So uh in in the buttons we have for the channels also we have options. Do you do we enumerate everything from zero to nine? Or do we have just uh channel plus  channel minus  just to just to scroll? The numbers. Right. Or on the L_C_D_ we can  you know Okay. So mm Alright. Right. Okay  so buttons definitely in but oh shall we uh try to draw a prec um Uh okay. Okay  okay  so the components. Right  so uh what about the the scrolling uh? Mm um I'm not sure it'll be a good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber. Uh i it Or or at the corners  edges  just the edges covered by rubber or something like that. Everything else in plastic or even titanium if we want to use it. Mm-hmm. Right  right. Right  okay  so so that gives us a more trendy look as well. Um Right. Yeah  and uh we're going more for the trends than for the usability anyway  right? So I'll rub that out. And uh colours can be provided with the case rather than Um but we still need to te think about the colour of our remote as such  you know  just keep it black  or Mm. Okay. Um okay  if you g go over to uh the integrated circuits. Uh since we're having L_C_D_s there there's no way that we're will be able to um what we do need to consider  however  is that the price is going up for the ever every such thing that we are considering  but since L_C_D_s seems to be uh a definite yes  so it seems to be one area where we would want to spend. So I'll rub off the other two. Oh is oh the constraint was uh yeah. Yeah. So I think uh we'll have uh uh using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one  I mean  a although it does seem uh interesting. But it does not hold any advantages as such for a yeah. Okay. Uh okay  so r we understand this better now that uh the the speaker is for the feedback  right? It it says uh the things that you type in or something like that  so Ye yeah  we we don't have too much information about it  um Yeah  okay  so so th this is in as well then  the sample speaker. Right. Flat on the top. Yeah. Okay. I_C_s? Uh integrated circuits. Yeah. Uh um we we're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as L_C_D_s  mm. Right. Yep. Mm. Mm-hmm. Cool. Yeah  okay. ,The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented two prototypes  one with an LCD screen and one without. They demonstrated how to navigate through the menus and presented the voice recognition and energy source components and the charging stand. They discussed their modular design. They discussed the parental control module and the titanium casing. The production costs were below budget for the basic models. The Marketing Expert presented three important user requirements  and also the fruit and vegetable and spongy material trends in fashion. He then led an evaluation of the prototypes according to these requirements. The group did not feel that the remotes sufficiently met the criteria. They decided to continue working on the design and to take out the LCD screen and voice recognition. They discussed the modular design and its advantages in attracting customers. The group discussed how to incorporate the fashion trends; it was suggested that one shape was used  which could be customized with skins. The Project Manager led an evaluation of the group's experience on the project. The group was pleased with the teamwork and leadership  but one participant complained that not enough information was given about each meeting's agenda.
