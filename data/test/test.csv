Source,Summary
Okay  we Mm. Okay  that's fine. Um. Okay  now work a little with me. Okay. Well  let's start it as it is. Okay  uh the method. There are a few questions that need to be answered  uh you already uh talked about it a little bit. Which buttons are wanted  uh is our remote control universal or should it be programmable. Uh if it should be programmeab grammeale then we need um something like a mode that you can switch it. Because then the buttons have to send out a different signal then they would normally do. And uh how big is the remote control uh going to be? I'll tell you why that's important to me. Um there are a lot of technical parts in the remote control  so uh uh that's why I also would like to say uh go a little bit easy on the designs  uh I heard ab uh you talking about beeps and about uh video screens  but uh the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already. So keep in mind that everything that you keep uh think of  it has to b to be built. So it's that's not as easy as it s might look like. Uh material study  I'm working on that um for the the costs. I have to check out how far I can go with that. Normally  a circuit board is made of fibreglass uh and the wires are made of copper. Uh that is how it is done and all the remote controls work that way  I think we can just go on with that. Um then I've read more integration of materials means less cost for the production. The more we can make uh at once uh in one piece  uh that is cheaper. Exactly  so if we make a circuit board with the the connections already on it  then that's cheaper. So we have to make something that's not too difficult in design again. This is what look like uh looks like if you press one button  so this is not the entire thing. You have the the power coming in  then you have like a switch. The switch uh uh uh if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor  that thinks over a Morse code  that's how you should see it. The Morse code goes to the amplifier  then uh the signal is sent to two uh light bulbs. You have infrared and an interv um uh how to say it? Uh a light in indication  light that you know that it's functioning. Uh here again  that's my story about the different modes  if you do want to make remote uh universal  then the processor has to uh make up a different Morse code when some button is pressed. That makes it much more complex  so we really need to have a look  do we want that or not. Uh I don't have any personal p uh preferences uh so far  except for uh the materials to be used uh light  that they are light. That was it. Hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Hmm. No  I think this is a good idea. But Go ahead. Y Yes  I think so too. Yeah. Okay  uh Mm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. I have to check that out  I'm not sure. That must be possible. Ja. I'm sorry  whe where do you wanna hit the T_ you wanna we want a button on the television. In th okay  but that rules out a universal remote control. Because that's not possible uh. Uh. Yeah. Exactly. Okay  then uh I'd I'd like to know now if we want the uh universal remote control or not  because that's uh determines everything I'm gonna do. If not Okay. Okay  then I go for that. Yeah. Okay. No  it's fine with me  but then I know what to look for. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Exactly. I already noted that. Mm  okay. Okay. Hmm. If we uh make a remote control with changeable covers  then we can also make uh a cover for every language area. That's fo is uh especially for older people  that they can read it read it in their own language. That's okay  okay. Huh. Uh okay. Hmm. Hmm. Mm. Okay. Uh but I know that the buttons are like a Nokia telephone on uh one sleeve  so you don't have to change your whole cover. Uh we can make something that you can only remove the sleeve. Know what I mean? It works the same as a Nokia telephone  it's it's in my uh 'kay. Exactly. Hmm. Mm. Yeah. I don't think so. No  I don't think so. Because the television needs to respond to the signal  and if it doesn't know how  it's Exactly  that's not possible. Hmm. Mm. Mm. But that might be broken. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Mm okay. Mm. But I think there must be a way uh to invoke the more complicated functions of a television. For instance  if your old remote control is broken and you buy ours  then uh you should be able to get everything out of the television that's in it. Because otherwise you'll lose functions by buying our Okay  I thi I think so too. And I think that our r remote control should not look like uh any other. For instance uh Sony makes all their remote controls exactly the same for all their devices  and you always grab the wrong one because formatting of the buttons is exactly the same  only the labels are different. We should not do that. Exactly. Mm that's your uh division. Hmm. Yeah. Perhaps we should also make uh something like a flash on it  if you if it's lost  for people that are deaf. They they won't hear the the beep. Yeah. Uh. Yeah  it's true  but it's it's only has to do so when you press the button that it's lost. So. deaf people? I have another idea  I'm not sure if it's possible. Mm. Yeah  me too. Shall we uh also look if it's possible to make a rechargeable remote? That you don't have to buy new batteries if every Mm  yeah. Uh. But that's already possible. Yes. Yes. Okay. Uh you could make a device  but I'm not sure how that uh is possible with the costs  that you can put in normal batteries  rechargeable  but it you're the remote also can act as a recharger. So then you can choose  you have every decision. Know what I mean? You can uh put in normal Penlites  rechargeable Penlites  but they can also be recharged with the remote  with a wire. So but But I think that will cost a lot. Uh a normal wire would be better. Like a like a P_D_A_  a hand-held. You can uh just put it in the electricity and it charges itself  you don't need basic station. Yes. That is possible  that's true. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yes. I'm going to try to find that out. I'm not sure if there's information available on this  but Hmm. These are uh comfort issues. So I think people will pay they wanted to pay for comfort. Well  this is comfort. Yes. Hmm. Yeah. Exactly. I think this is a brilliant product. I would buy it myself. Uh. I like the covers. That's a brilliant idea. I never thought I hope if I have information about that  I'm gonna Mm. Yeah. I would like to make a decision. What it costs and what kind of materials that we can uh choose what we want in it and exactly  I need it. Was it not possible to uh send emails around the office? Not. Yeah  okay. What uh what did you wanna say? Mm. Mm. Mm. But that's the question  is it? Because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu. If it isn't  then we cannot reach it. I think so too. I think so too. Uh isn't there a possibility to do research on that  so we know that for sure? If you rule out functions  then uh and that gets known  then people are not gonna buy it. Then the consumer bond or something says uh you cannot do this and that with it. That's a bad bad com commercial for okay. That's true. Hmm. Hmm. Did they really said it like that? Those two things. Do they realise how much that costs? That's almost undoable. No  that's that's. Even if i if we have this lost unit  then we cannot do it for that price. Yeah  that's true. Mm. Hmm. Uh. Uh I But I really need finance information. We all do. Mm. Uh. Hmm. And the design  it should differ. This is Philips  huh? Philips has this. Okay. Hmm. Uh. Mm. Oh  I realise if we make it small  then it needs to be a little thicker  because I need to put all the electronics in it. If we make it s uh smaller  uh less wide  then we need to m make it a little thicker  because I have to put all the electronics in it. No. Hmm. Me too. Ah but. Hmm. No. M I personally would prefer it on the top. Huh. But it Hmm. Mm. Hmm. They want it uh. We should just try to make that if it's possible. If it is possible we should really do it  but we need that information. Also keep in mind again  the L_C_D_ screen is very flat  but it needs transistors  resistors  I don't know what more and that needs space. So I have to look if that's possible. But if we Hmm. Hmm. If we have a a space issue  we can also lose one battery. It is rechargeable  so we can stick with one instead of two. That might be an option. Yeah  but if we need two batteries and an L_C_D_ screen  that means a lot of space that we need. But it has to be a little bit heavier. Okay. No  but the things behind it. space. Like a process uh. I like this one more. Mm. Mm. I'll try to. One more uh thing I'd like to say  uh let's give this uh a name  and not like some vague serial number that no one understands  like with cars. Shall we all try uh to think about a name? Good luck. Yeah  I've Do we uh save the? Yes. Sorry  a little bit of pl little problem with computer.. Uh. Yeah  sure  no problem. Um there was a little problem with my computer so not uh the whole uh presentation uh Yeah. Um Okay  and I want to open the my s oh no. Oh no  that's okay. Uh slide show. Yes. The functional requirements  it's uh uh very important for uh the user  he he wants to yeah. The the method we used uh it it's not m not a slide  because it went wrong  but the method we use uh  um we tested it w uh with uh a hundred uh men  and we asked them to w uh what the remote uh f feel uh like and uh what what's uh important. Uh People  sorry. Both women and men  yeah. Okay. Uh the findings um uh seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly. Um Yeah  and yeah  most th th they want to spend money for a better system  for better remote control  so we can do uh a l a little uh nice things with it  and um they use yeah  they use zap a lot  um uh fifty percent say they only So that's the most important things. Um oh yeah  not all of it is it on mine on my PowerPoint presentation  but um uh the relevant buttons are the power  the channel selection and the volume selection. It's uh the most basic buttons that a user wants uh to use. Uh less important is tel teletext  uh um they use it  but it's not uh very uh important uh on the scale of zero to ten they six and a half uh and but not important is the channel selection  the the hmm? Oh  the the no no no no no  that's very important  but uh w and not important in the audio settings  display settings and uh Yeah. Um new preferences preferences. Uh um um beep to find your control  was that was in the test  the the most people uh f find it uh irritating uh when they cannot find a rem their remote control  so uh I think it's a bee beep to sound it and uh you can find it. And another thing uh they want was uh speech recognition um so they can say uh what they want to let's go to channel one and uh that's uh kind of things. And they want maybe an uh L_C_D_ screen um to to look it um wh what's on every channel uh and uh what do I want with it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um Uh my personal preferences is uh a button for my favourite channel  so I can uh I dunno  so I can zap to my uh f uh quick uh to my favourite channel wh what I uh so  the remote mu must see or um must um see wha what mine preferences are for which channel  so I can zap t to What? Yeah. Yeah. Recognise Yeah. Yeah  that's uh what my personal preference like. No  itself. Maybe it's easier to to sell it  but I don't know it's manageable  but we will uh we will see. Yeah  it's a little bit uh it's the end of it. It's a little bit uh I lost it  the computer uh crashed  so. Yeah. Darn computer. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm uh. Yeah. Uh. Yeah. B Yeah  and they want to pay for it and uh With more Where with more technical specifications in the Yeah. Yeah. But oh? Yeah  with with an L_C_D_ screen you can Why? Nokia w Uh. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Mm uh. Yeah. Um Everyone uh wants to buy it  so we w yeah. Yeah. Or one. Or when you say one two uh i it uh it's enough  right? But Oh yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. But b But every Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Mm yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Um yeah. And uh with different colours uh. Okay. Yeah. Uh. And a light uh Volume. Uh it's it's fine  I think. Oh d Yeah. Just And L_E_D_ uh on it. Just a light on it or Very important. Oh  that's It's And But you r And you are reading from the t you always read from the top to the the bottom of it. Yeah  so it's Yeah. So i it's sorry? No  it's no. Uh. Hmm. Or or with the volume selection. Around uh not uh not at top at the around the volume selection. I don't know where exactly  but Wha No. Yeah. Yeah  that's better. On the right. Yeah. Maybe it's more ex expensive. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah yeah. Yeah  that's g But Which Yeah. Yeah. But Yeah  they want to pay for it. Yeah. Th uh there was not a el ask esque But But f hmm. Yeah. Yeah  okay. Yeah yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My computer crashed  so uh I lost my uh presentation  but I have the uh Yeah  but I Here I have the the s the homepage of uh our internet  and here is my here is my marketing report  maybe you ca you can look at uh that and Ah yeah. And one And uh wha what people want  I've uh I have another thing uh Yeah. Um Uh what I al already said is the the uh the remote controls are always lost  but it it's also for people  they want to learn it fast  not uh they want to No It's yeah  it's easy to learn wi and uh Um And The If Um If um Another thing I want to say is that uh we are looking at the market for the age uh younger than forty. Um on my report  I didn't uh ish I didn't show it in my uh presentation  because my computer crashed. Um they want to pay for an L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition. So i yeah. Yeah  and Yeah. Uh but If if they So uh we can We can look at the possibilities for an uh L_C_D_ and uh I dunno. Yeah. How much it will cost and Um It will come uh Yeah. Different colours maybe. But all Okay. If you're reading from top to bottom  I think it's better to put it uh at the top. It's j Uh. But i if you if you are going to uh put the L_C_D_ on it  I think it's very important to use it  uh because it's use it uh But nee the function of it. So you can use it maximum  because uh it's a lot it costs a lot. So Yeah. It's expensive to build it  so you must use the maximum of it. Huh. Uh. But uh Yeah  I know uh. In middle of it. In the middle. Yeah. It's the most import yeah.. Finish meeting now. It's on your computer. Uh. Or And uh what about speech recognition uh Yeah  yeah  but or or an L_C_D_ or an uh speech. I think it's L_C_D_ is better now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  okay  yeah  that's yeah  that's okay. Oh  good. Yeah. Same... Oh  there he is. Go ahead. That's pretty shocking uh. Which channel selection? Oh  okay. Is that manageable? 'Cause it sounds pretty expensive too. Okay. Okay. Shall I go? Okay. So  some technical functions. Basically I have some issues which you discussed earlier. Uh let's just start with the method. It sounds really easy  what does the user do  what does the th remote control do  but there are quite some issues. So the things I'm going to concentrate on are the user aspect  because the technical aspect  that's pretty much covered. We can do that. What goes wrong at the user. Gets the remote control. Where is the remote control? We've all had it once  I want to watch some television  where's the remote control? That was one of your ideas which you posted in the network folder  a really good idea. Uh these are just the issues. I come to some uh personal experience  findings  possible solutions later. Searches for the button. There are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear. Uh so either we lose those or we try to make it a little bit more clear. Uh also symbols tend to fade after a while. There's nothing more annoying than faded symbols  because you don't know which channel is this button  so possibly we could find uh something for that  yes. Uh covered that. Oh yes  user presses the button. Um usually when you have a lot of buttons  buttons are small. So you press more once remote control goes kablouey or something like that  so we have to pay attention not to put too mun too many buttons on uh the remote control. And possibly also the size  so more important buttons  bigger si So this is basically what I h had in mind in the fade-proof symbols  locator  a sound  uh so clear we should stick to existing symbols  but maybe we could do a little uh investigation to see whether some symbols are uh need to be replaced by others. Uh This I pretty much covered. So what we want to go to is not this one  but more less buttons  easy  some bigger buttons. So that's basically uh what I had in mind. This is not the final design  this is just a general idea of how I'd like to see uh basically the general idea. So that was it. Yeah  I think it's a really good idea. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Oh. Is it manageable? Is it easy? Yeah. And it costs too much to fabricate  so we're on a tight budget here. And it's Maybe just a slap-on sticker with a button which sends out a small signal. Yeah  exactly. And it's Besides that  the technology isn't really super yet  so that is a problem in implementing this. It's a good idea  but it's just not I don't think the market's ripe for that yet. But should the exchangeable covers include the buttons themselves or just the C that's a problem with the with the text then. Oh yeah  I know what you mean. Yeah. Pretty straightforward. Is it techni technically possible to uh send a signal to a television and then pops up a menu  because we're working with different types of television  so we're going to work with that? It's an in-built menu  isn't it? Yes. So basically we Or we could use a double-sided for less used functions you Yeah  with the cover. I it's basically an idea to overcome these issues  because No  but basic functions but functions which are not frequently used. Because if we use a universal remote control  we're going to have to have most buttons on it  so Yeah. Yeah  I have some ideas. I have some ideas. I'll put some on paper and present them next time uh the ideas that I have. I heard a beep go. Yeah  but we like some some curves or Yeah. Oh  we get the general ideas  yes. Yeah  and since you're holding it like this  I suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume yeah yeah. So you have the up channel the down channel the volume  do we want that horizontal or vertical? This is basically what people are accustomed to  so Yeah  but this is just a g general idea. Uh maybe the menu button can go i in the middle. Whoa. You won't be able to find it. We could make a combination that it goes beep and that you that some light lights up. So we have the basic channels we've got here  uh the power button somewhere over here? I usually press it on top. At least that's what I'm accustomed to. What would you like to? Okay  mute button. Is that somewhere here? Is that used often? The mute button? Do people use that often? 'Cause uh I'm pretty much accustomed to it right over here  at least in general  but It's not that important  no. Sure. That's pretty much what people are accustomed to  aren't they? Well  I'm accustomed to the channels being on top. But isn't that expensive in the entire package? But again  isn't that too expensive? 'Cause that means that we have to implement rechargeable batteries  a docking station And do people actually want that? To pay extra they want to pay for rechargeable? Can can we save this or Yeah. Could you post some other essentials of what people want  so that I can work with some buttons  where to put it You seem to have information on that  I'd like to uh see some of it. No  it's not. No. Oh  your computer. Okay. Well  I have your PowerPoint presentation  I can get some inf information out of that. Let's see. Oh  where would we Where would we want the uh teletext button? Because we decided that it's n not that important. Do we put it somewhere over here? Or maybe this is something for the next meeting  I can draw out some ideas. Yeah. Well  we have decided more or less the basic structure. I can put the other buttons in Yeah. Yeah. Maybe another idea uh. Yes  but it should cover all the functions  so possibly  just an idea that popped in Yeah  but we could go a step further  because some T_V_s have the uh possibility to adjust brightness  that kind of menus. Yes  but it Because we're making We need to adjust to the technology. True. No  I thi Oh  we're not going to be able to sell it for twenty-five then  with an L_C_D_ screen. Well I doubt it  but Well  I had basically Something like this. To make it kind of futuristic. So what kind of Yeah  sure. Now it's pretty much tucked away in your hand. I'm I'm still not convinced of the Yeah. So basically can I what we have to decide now is uh what goes on top. Do we put the volume control and the channel control here  or do we put it on he Would we like to press it in the middle? Yes  but we do agree that we keep this at the centre  because it's basically the most important function. Well  that would make them quite small. So maybe you'd put them here. Yes  but a big remote control probably not something which people would like. So would we like this or would we like the Let's see what we have here. Okay. So I think of a name. So Yes  go and finish up and I'll see you at lunch. Yeah. Wait for the marketing director actually  so. Anyways. Uh. See  shall we wait? I'm not sure if he's late or delayed or whatever  so I'm gonna start soon  we have now don't have much time anyway. There you are  okay. Uh no problem. We're about to start  so have a seat. Okay  welcome again. Today  functional design phase. I'll take you over the minutes of last last meeting. Okay  that was just to get to know each other  have a little thoughts on what your vision is and on this project  so I put the minutes on the I made on the on the p the the project share  so if you wanna review them  they're there. I will do so after every meeting  so if you have some information you wanna take back you can find it there. Anyways  um today three presentations  from every one of you. Um after that I got some new project requirements from project board  so we're gonna go af go after over this later. But I wanna start with uh stuff you did first  so we can see what everybody came up with. And after that we can have the new requirements and share some thoughts  so. Who would like wanna go first? Take it. Anyway  let's see what you have. Uh it's still a bit open. You should close it on your own notebook  I guess. Yeah. So there? Okay. If I can cut in  is it people or men? Is it people  okay. 'Cause I thought it was only men  so 'Kay. So we have to s we have to do something about that. Okay. Okay  just talk ahead. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay  that's okay. That's a little weird. Okay  we can we can hide those under a menu or something  okay. That's like a button on your T_V_? Remote  okay. Okay. We wanna have a little preview on the remote control. Preview what's on the channel. Okay. That sounds too It's possible  but uh I think it's expensive  but do continue. Okay  you don't set it yourself  it just remembers the channel that you are on most  for example. You want the you want it to be programmed  for example y programmed f or you want it to recognise your favourite channel? Let's see  you you spend twenty minutes each day on that channel  so it recognises your favourite channel. Okay  so it's it it does it recognise itself  you don't have to set it Okay. Okay. I see. Okay. No problem  it's it's okay  that's Yeah  go ahead. That seems very good. Mm-hmm. Okay  so have it more make it more durable actually. Okay. Okay  so the buttons should be Mm-hmm. Yeah. Wow. The s Yeah. Make it make them bigger. Even more durable uh. Okay. Yeah  it's true. Yeah  that's clear. No  of course uh Yeah. I must say that it Hmm. That was it. Okay  that was good. So we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere and increase it the durability of of the thing  so The other aspects  we'll just see how what you came up with and what's possible for that budget. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Of course  hmm. You mean integrate them all into the circuit board. Okay. Yeah  okay. So you have Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. That was it? I'll get back to my thing then. Uh Okay  back this up to the screen. So I got some new information on the project specifications are changing a little. Like you said uh teletext is not not very popular anymore because the uh the internet  nowadays people don't use the teletext anymore or hardly  so it can either Well  I don't think we should remove the button  because there are always people who are using it. But I don't think it should be very it should be one of the big buttons for example. Just put it somewhere or under second option or whatever. It's not important anymore. Um we're targeting young people now  because our um This is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people  which are um the younger people were defined under forty. I so I think it's that's also good with the fashion and everything  so yeah. They want to pay for it  people are willing to spend money actually to buy a um remote that they like. If they like the way it looks  the way it functions  so they're actually gonna spend uh spend money on it. Yeah. see how far we can go with it anyway  so And one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable  which is apparently black and yellow  but I'm not sure if we I think we should keep the the logo in mind  because with colours you can uh have a lot of uh fashionable colours and everything on it  which suits everybody's taste. So With that concept I started thinking  so why not just steal Nokia's idea and just make changeable covers for your I mean those cost hardly anything I think  and people could even spend extra money on buying a cover and so have an entire new remote control that they like to see. Or we can sh for example we can make a different a basic design. And sell the covers separately  for example. That's just a little marketing idea that could be applied  so you can p it appeals to really everyone. So you don't have to I think you don't have to make entire remote controls. We make a basic one and manufacture this cover separately. So that was that was my idea on what we could do to appeal this product to everyone. So just I'm not sure if you came up with anything in the meantime  after making a presentation. Would you like to share? Okay. Oh yeah. I think we should lose the L_C_D_ screen  like you said. I think for example it's it's huge I think the L_C_D_ is huge  it consumes batteries like hell. I think it takes up a lot of a lot of power. It costs a lot  I think. What we could do  what could be possible  is maybe not an L_C_D_ screen but with a preview  but y I'm not sure if it's even possible. For example  a little T_V_ guide. Like you have a little just just a text only  not colour  just a little text thing so you can use your remote as a T_V_ guide. I'm not sure it's even possible  but maybe okay  make it Yeah  find a little compromise in that  but What did I write down? I think the p yeah  the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement  just make a button on your T_V_ and just hit the button  it beeps somewhere. I think it's easy to implement  we should go for that. Uh speech recognition. I thin Yeah  I mean where else should you put it? Yeah  but how are you gonna use that if your I mean if your remote control is lost  how are you gonna press where are you gonna press the button? A slap-on sticker. Oh  you mean as like a separate thing you can attach to your T_V_. Yeah  that could be possible. A little little box you can attach to your T_V_ is fine then  okay. I think it's universal. I think we should go for universal  because apparently we're a separate company making separate c remote controls to sell to a lot of diverse people. I think universal remote control should be possible. Yeah  I think we're targeting everyone  so remote Okay  universal is good. Speech recognition  I think it's very hard  because we're selling across multiple countries. So I think implementing speech recognition is such a small um apparatus  it's very hard to do. Yeah  but I don't see Arabian people speaking one  two uh whatever. It's Yeah. It's not a mature technology  I think it takes a lot of memory and everything in in a remote control  so I don't think it should be implemented in a remote control yet uh. What else do we have? Um well you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable. So the the the symbols won't fade  maybe a little harder plastic or especially li we don't maybe we don't have have to do all the buttons  but especially the ones that are um the popular buttons  so those always fade first. Mm the thing is the most important things that we have now. Let's see. For example? Well  we're not we're not targeting older people  we should remember that. Everything we target is under forty  so. You assume that that they read correctly and I think they're The most important thing about young people is that they're really sensitive to to trends that are passing through the world  so No  of course. No  I think it's just something you you put over them  because Yeah we c Yeah  you ca Well  tha that's not a that's not a bad that's not even it's not even a bad idea. I mean  for example  if you're if you're into the durability issue you could For example  if your buttons are faded  after I mean if you make a durable remote  they are faded  you can just buy a new cover. Uh I'm not sure it's it's hard to make. So it's a good and a bad idea. Mm-hmm. Yeah  I know  it's just just a one one piece of rubber for example  okay. Yeah  that's what I something I have to look into. Either either change both the buttons and and the cover or just the cover  I'm not sure which which is easier  so Um anyway  yeah  this is what we're gonna do afterwards  just lunch break and have more individual work after that  so let's see what we let's see we So you have to come up with a components concept  yeah. I want some you should do some trend-watching  because even if we're if we're gonna do those covers and everything  what people really want  that's what we need to know in this phase  because that's gonna be the essential final design that we're gonna come up with. Um Yeah  I think user interface is fairly obvious. I mean it should be very intuitive  s Yeah  it should speak for itself. Uh for example I bought a remote control last week with a new T_V_  it was it l it's like all buttons and you have no idea what it does at first  and I'm total T_V_ new  anyway. So I think it should be have less or l very little buttons and maybe a second second level menu for the advanced things. Or maybe just stick 'em under a menu  like you said the um the sound options and the surround and whatever  they're more complicated  just stick 'em under one menu and uh give it a just put it in in s in a software piece  you can menu and you can uh select everything you want to to set on your T_V_. That is true. No  that's true. Yeah  that's true. I'm not sure if it's impossible  but uh there's a chance it's not  so. A double-sided remote control? I don't think that's useful. Yeah  but then you're gonna have a lot of wasted buttons. For example you have a Sony T_V_ and the half of the buttons won't function if you have a for a Sony that won't for a Philips T_V_. I don't think we should Yeah  for exam I'm not s yeah  for ex you have to make it a little decision between the part if you want a universal remote control that it should do what people usually do with their T_V_s  not not the very complicated settings that you can usually do that with uh either a old old remote control if they really hate that thing  but you can't you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of T_V_s. I think there's I think there is a standard for example between uh because usually the the menu is the menu button is is usable between different brands. Especially the big ones  the big brands  so. 'Cause everybody I have a universal remote control and it can use the menu button  so I think I'm not sure  if you can put some research into that  if it's possible. Uh I think just a b and the navigation is very basic  it's usually the same thing. Yeah. Yeah  that's true. I think so uh we need to put some research into that if if we can open the menu  I think it's possible  just the way how to. Yeah  then then you could do everything I suppose  because usually the T_V_s have tha that inside in this other little piece of software  so it's okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah I think it should be a little distinct from everything else  because it's either it's both mayb maybe the shape can be a little different. Maybe it's a little more curves or whatever. So um Yeah  this. Not sure what because we have forty minutes  I'm not sure how much time we have left for the meeting anyway  so. Yeah  but it wasn't me  it was him closing something. So anyway  yeah  we could do some i do some work now on on the design for example. I mean what do you want  do you want  but Yeah  may maybe something like this. But though smooth inside. So you have the transmitter here for example. Let's see that you what would be handy. I think that the the buttons should be the channel buttons should be uh on their own. Let's see one  two God damn it. Yeah  okay. Another one here. Let's see what I think this should these are always on top of the of the control  so they should be here. Think it's like this. Withi within the Yeah  just take it. Do you take triangles or Um I think it should be I think it Maybe we should make 'em bigger or whatever. Yeah. Yeah  in the middle. It's it's usually uh there  but Mm. Yeah  but for example if it's lost in your armchair  we'll not see the flash. And flash takes up a lot of batteries again. Yeah. Yeah  I thought about for deaf people for example  so. We could do that. Uh let's see. Oh yeah  it's true. Um that thing should be central. You shouldn't be you uh shouldn't press it by accident  but it shouldn't be stacked away somewhere. Yeah. Yeah  like that's gonna work. Yeah  I thought maybe we should move the buttons down and put it here for example to From top to bottom. Yeah  that's true  you should I think the bu the power button should be on top  'cause it's the first thing you do  turn it on. So power button on top. Um Mute. Do we hardly I think it should be at the bottom somewhere. Mute. Turn the sound off. I don't think it's important  but I think it I think it should be you c you could put it somewhere here. No  because it Yeah  people are accustomed to that  it's Can I have that? That's j Take this out and here see Uh are we gonna take triangles anyway? I'm drawing triangles  but Yeah  it's maybe a bigger lesser than thing. So anyway  I think this is should be the channels and or sh Here  okay. Okay  should we chan okay  this two  channel up and down. Well  for that is it's on one part it's um it's a good thing to recharge it Maybe we should what what could be possible is one with rechargeable batteries for example. You have just put Penlite batteries that are rechargeable  because it's an it's it's it's very annoying. I'm not sure y I'm not sure it's if it's expensive  but just take a look at it  because it might be a very good idea. Because if it's it's uh useful to have it rechargeable  but at the same time  if you don't want recha if you forgot to recharge it and you wanna watch T_V_ now  you wanna be able to put different batteries in it  use it now and not in half an hour. How about I think I have a nice idea. Not exactly uh. I think it's uh it's a pretty good idea to have uh like sort of a maybe a base station that you put on the T_V_. Could be flat  you could insert your uh remote into it. I'm not sure. A what? Well  we were talking about the fact that we wanted to insert either a beep or a flash into the thing with a little separate signal or So you could put that on a T_V_ for example. It could be very flat  could be very small. It's a very small Yeah  I'm drawing it big now  but So you can put your remote on flat for example. And at the backside of remote just just just a little hole for example um you just put it down  it recharges for example. I don't think it's very expensive. I'm not sure if it costs a lot  that that's what he r That's that you that's what you buy yourself. It's just an idea  we have to find out if it's possible. Do they want but they want a rechargeable one? I'm not sure  you should find out if it's if rechargeable is important. Yeah. They want to pay for comfort  we just assu we we could either make a separate station which just sends a signal to the remote control to either beep or flash to find it  um and Yeah  we have to either that or make it integrated with a with a docking station. I think it would be good actually. I like the beep part anyway. So um let's go through the Covers is covers is good. Yeah  it's Oh we can save this. Up and saved. We even saved the ant. Um Okay. So what we have is you have I think you have to do a lot of work on if it's possible for the cost. Maybe yeah  or maybe you can find out i what people are willing to pay. We are going for twenty five Euros sales price  but just try to find out what they're willing to pay for it  because if they're willing to pay more  we could lose a little profit and maybe attract more customers  uh we just have to see what it looks like. Yeah  if you have some financial information that that'd be nice  so. Hmm. No  it wasn't wasn't allo it was possible  not allowed  so. So that's um why I'm not sure that you're allowed to share documents on the on the draft. I don't care. I haven't heard any complaints yet  so. Um Yeah  the oh  they inc uh they include the new one. Or just for you. Oh no  I didn't have that. All it tells just let's make make a new tick the new one. Um other side. Yeah  let's increase it a little because Yeah  draw us up some some designs of of possible just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big  so the more less important More or less. Just play a little with this  put l shift a little up or down and we'll see what looks best. Or just po post your designs from time to time on the product share. Yeah  so we don't want we want very little buttons  just the buttons you use a lot. Well what we had function that what people do  so. People change channels  people they change the volume and they they change channel  they turn T_V_ off and on  for example. That's the basic fu that's what you do I'm not sure who present that again  but those are the basic function that people use it for  so those should be very well represented. That's true  but that's what we stick under the menu button. Everything is you say in every T_V_ that's configured under the menu. Yeah  but But I think most modern T_V_s have it in their menu. Uh we'll we'll see what we can come up with. Under forty. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Yeah yeah. The want to pay for Oh. Uh shall we? Younger  age sixteen and forty five. That's all here  here it says Yeah  age sixteen forty fi interest in main features more critical. Okay  so we're not focusing on this. Um All the interest in features  not really the L_C_ oh here. Would you pay for uh speech recognition in a remote control. Hmm  okay? Speech recognition is quite Yeah  just look at the possibilities then  because if apparently it's what people want  it's supposed to be a luxurious remote  maybe it's not even that expensive. Or find a compromise  maybe just a black and white or for some extra information on it  on your programmes. Me too. I mean we all do. Right. I think it's something we should put into consideration. Apparently it's what people want  so. We should see if what it costs  if it's possible. Yeah. Yeah  we should do a little thing about design  because it looks boring really to me. Even if you put it even if you put a different cover on it  it looks still looks boring  so. I have no clue. I just drew something what which would fit into your hand easily. I think it's a very Sorry? Yeah? Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah  but you have to j just keep in mind it shouldn't be too heavy. I mean we can stick it in in there  I think. Huh even if in the worst case we can even Could you give me the pen back? So let's say that people would want an L_C_D_ thing. Let's take take the basic design again  what we oh  crap uh came up with. I'll just make it a little bigger now. So a transmitter here. Anyway. We could let's say we have an L_C_D_ screen  people want an L_C_D_ screen. So then we should probably put it here. It doesn't have to be really big  but just just have to be has to be there. Think it's a good place  people don't No? It's not that uh it's not the most important function  it's just an extra thing  it just you press the buttons on top  because your finger is on top. How can you use an L_C_D_ screen? Yeah  but why I I'm not sure. Uh if you t if you press a button  you can see it  ri I'm not sure wha I'm trying to imagine myself what it would look like. You would prefer it n Okay. So we have three people saying it should be on top. Okay  but then you would would s have to stack away your buttons somewhere else. Anyways. Uh this looks a little About the L_C_D_s thing. Well if it if it's if it's possible wi if it's not too expensive  we should include it  because it's it's cool. Uh we have green now uh Or maybe we should m we could uh draw draw something a bit that has it on on on the bottom. Maybe in a circle for example  like we like in this example. I think this is not good  but for we could make circular buttons for example. For up and down  ma make it a circle on it  because it I think the channel button should be in the centre. Channel button should be st stick together  for example here in this section. Because it's uh We're not sure about the size anyway  just a general design. You can make it as big as you want. For example if you take uh No  let's see. For example just Yeah. I don't think if we if we even use an L_C_D_ screen  we need to  definitely. Yeah  but we have to see what the si what the size is. The L_C_D_ doesn't have to nee doesn't need to be very big. Mm let's see. Finish meeting now. Okay  we will. So either We either we have to decide what what people want. Either this one  this this could be the luxurious one. So we have channel buttons here. I'm just drawing something uh. Uh I think this would this would look cool. You could have it for example small buttons here for some extra functions  so if your basic function's here  we should like we decided before  programmes up and down  and volume here. Well you can just no  I'm not sure if we can do that  but we could put a microphone in here for example. Just to do research into both  w what it costs and what it takes for space. But let's cut the meeting for now yes. Yeah  let's think of a name  okay. Uh okay. Okay  at anyways  the the minutes will be on the on the web shortly  so there we go uh. Yeah  to all. ,The UI and ID presented a prototype drawing of the remote control design. The rubber case is yellow with black buttons and dark yellow for the menus. There are buttons for teletext  favourite channel  mute and OK. It incorporates both LCD screen and speech recognition. The prototype proved over budget (17 euros). The main contributing factors were the LCD and speech recognition. The latter was taken out  along with the special colour. Everyone agreed that the financial information should not have been given to them at the last moment. After the costing  the original prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad). The criteria used were look and feel (1)  whether it is easy to find (1)  whether it is easy to learn (2)  use of LCD (3)  speech recognition (7)  trendiness (2). Finally  the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (satisfactory)  leadership and teamwork (happy with it  but they missed communicating in between meetings)  and means (SMARTboard could be improved in terms of response time  the digital pens could not be used on more than one page at the same time). Finally  the decided to call their design Triple-R. 
Okay. Okay. Next.. What do you mean there? Okay. You can disconnect it there no? Then you can connect this one or this one yeah. All to your computer. Oh yeah. Okay. Hmm. Yeah. Well it would be f No you can't. Oh. Well  it depends you know like there is uh it's a very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on  off  one  two  twenty three  yeah. It's it's going to be li it's not going to be s so easy but u usually it's going to be more of an isolated case but it's but I don't know with twenty fi Okay it's uh decline. Okay. Okay. Now you can move I think yeah. It's a channel selection  a module  this and this function  go to the. Yeah. But is it uh can you just buy it on the market and f plug it in or you want to ma Well it to du it's just you had to change the frequencies. Yeah. But you should be careful  people are sometime becoming problem  like a guy has recently designed a remote uh uh uh which could switch off any other T_V_s  so basically through all the things. So maybe we should think of yeah. Yeah so you can just go on the street and then switch off everyone's T_V_ and you can just walk away You don't have to be near the T_V_ at all. Yeah so. Okay. So I can take I think mine now there. Okay so voila. Hmm I can take mine it's okay  voila  mm so mm. Okay. It's on the desktop. Technical function. Okay. Like so. Well. So um I'm going to talk a little bit about the technical function so wha what actually it's about what is the user going to do  I think my last presented what is going inside  so what's the user is going to see from the outside and how he is going to use it. So well the approach is that uh basically the idea is to send a message to the T_V_ set  as Mael has pointed  and it will be decoded by the T_V_ and usually we it is easier to have uh keys or buttons with which people can uh press and then um changing a button will basically uh change the message which is being sent to the T_V_ and uh um a and basically it sends an internal signal and decoded by the receiver. So p as um Anna has said that this ki people are interested in things which are you don't need to k press the keys  people are can have a speech recognition but this is uh s a question which will we have to see later. But in the present scenario is that you have certain keys and you press it like your mobile phone  and it sends a message to the T_V_. And um so generally mm I don't have some figures sorry but um so there are two kinds of uh remote if you popularly in the household  actually so you have a standard T_V_ remote where you have just a on  off button and play  uh volume change and uh keys for the number and more than one digit option. And if you see for example righ right now uh uh even the one uh on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine  but tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows  but uh uh. Then there is uh this is the standard one with without any fancy thing you know like i it doesn't have teletext option  it can without any  it's a very simple thing  um which which you can vouch. And then you have uh what's the v video remote file which is like usually it has almost all the keys over there and  but it then it has other options like stop uh and then you play the movie or uh or fo fast forward the movie or something like that so i it has those so these are the standard uh commonly found remote controls in the uh market. And then whi which is generally used by the people. And then well personal preferences I would uh basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing where the we could have both the uh the f a T_V_ and the remote video remote control because uh some of the keys in the video's remote control and the T_V_ they could be integrated together so that uh we could um aim for the like in the f coming future um that type of uh applications with Yeah. Yeah. Um actually um you could you could think of um having s a y you can have a key which could tell y it could go to the video thing but um uh yo you you you still can't um in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the V_C_R_ option and you could play it or You can also think about having like um I in a few days you will be ha in in few ye coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate uh sitting setup box and uh you have uh um something like uh uh you do you do you suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you and uh you can just you know uh when you come back you could just switch on that thing and uh watch a program. In that case you want to browse faster  browse slow  you want to have those kind of functionalities. It's the next generation thing  but it is going to come in couple of years. It's goi Yeah it's Yeah. Yeah. So it's going to record your things and you and you you need basically the functionalities what you need in both uh uh video as well as in the standard T_V_ thing. No no we are not making a universal remote  we are just looking at uh giving a scenario  I have a T_V_ and tomorrow I am going to have set up box which is going to sit there and uh it's going to do that job for me. Yeah. So Okay so that p ends my presentation. Well. So we can always discuss about it for example uh the presently the video market actually uh this demand  video over-demand or what we call it as  it's presently booming up actually so it i like people are providing like uh things like uh uh movies  you can select actually so you want to watch a movie and uh your p your provider gives a list of movies  and then you select those list. And it basically you go off  it downloads the movie  it gives for you and then when you come you want to loo watch it on your T_V_. And thi this is going to come. Yeah it can be streamed online for you and you can say what time I want to watch the movie and Yeah so. Yeah. Yeah. Um. Yeah it's uh well you you can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys  you know right now if you take it you have like zero  one  two  three like a keys separately  but suppose if you take the the present trend of mobile phones there are like big thick keys you press on the top  it takes one number  you press on the bottom it takes another number  and uh basically uh uh so the space covered so that you don't see two separate keys there actually so it it is like uh um i i it is like uh Yeah so. So for example uh Well uh Okay  it works. Fine. So  for example you have uh presently uh keys like one  two  three like this  actually  and uh uh four five six like that and uh you can have keys like this in form like uh keys like that Forty minutes? Yeah so you you you can have uh keys like uh which are which are like so. too sorry  so we basically don't change the uh original order of them but then the keys are more spacious  they don't look uh so there there is a very sligh thing  so if you press on the top it takes the one  it takes the three  uh four  sorry four here uh five and six  so the keys can be it looks you know not very much cluttered but it looks nice for you don't have too many keys but you can have a lot of options t if you press on the to Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well Well I it's fine with me like the price as long as it is uh not too expensive. Uh and it d uh Our provin Mm. Uh yeah  that's that's what we needed basically. Uh that's needed right now. And uh basically you can look to the standards of other Actu Yeah. Yeah you can also browse through all the standards you know  where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them. Okay. Okay. Voila. Hmm. So. Well. Oh I don't have anything right now. We can we'll we'll go and we'll I'm sure we'll up something good for the Yeah so we meet in well what are our Okay. Cool. So see you later. Yep. Perfect. So y you are the secretary also. Right? Okay. Perfectly yeah yeah of course uh-huh. You mean the social target group who we wants to target? Oh the customers  okay. It's it's easy to learn or how do you say it's Okay too much time to learn. Okay. Not enough Maybe y y you cannot put this webpage online on the Ah it's it okay it's a webpage on the C_ it's a file okay. O otherwise you yeah. You can connect this one. Yeah. So these are important numbers that Matthew and I need to take into account for our functional um Yeah Yeah these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account for the uh both yeah user interface and functional design. Because if there are many numbers and we need to select to to constraint uh our design based on what is more important. Speech recognition in Ah okay. So that we don't Do we not need any button on the remote control it would be all based on speech. Okay. Interesting idea. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And we don't know where the state of the art of speech recognition is  maybe you know? But it's quite noisy if there is the T_V_ uh shouting. Okay. So you had to to to summarise maybe the Mm. Mm-hmm. I thi You us yeah yeah. Okay perfect. ... Mm 'kay. Yeah. Mm I okay I stay I can move as far as Maybe I take your chair? I okay. So I think as everybody knows uh I'm the uh Industrial Designer. And uh in this presentation uh this group presentation um is gonna focus on the working design of the the remote control. Um I'd like first to give a quick a very simple introduction  how does it work  so that everybody knows even if you don't have a very uh technical background uh what is it because I think in the product it is important. So basically um the basic function of a remote control is to send uh messages to another system that is fixed. And so an energy source feeds an integrated circuit  the chip  that can compose messages  usually uh through a um infrared bit and uh the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the the messages  alright. So my method for um designing the yeah the work design uh yeah first the the main point is that I would wish to to make a really functional product. I would prefer to have very functional um capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesn't work. So for that yeah as it's important to take into account the user requirements from the Marketing uh Expert uh Anna and um w to to we should agree on what are the technical functions uh for this remote control and I show you the the working design. So um basically uh here is a really large view of what we want. Uh we want an on off button  it can be uh it's simple but it's it's important  and also uh the to both channels as well as other buttons that come after  right. So the components I quickly draw here  is that in this part you have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver so that's my method is um will be to well my aim would be to uh design the and choose the chips and the infrared um components to build the remote control right. So of course we need energy sources and uh uh the receiver a a receiver. This is very quick uh design  uh you stop me or interrupt me if uh you don't agree on it on that. And um so what I have found and after a lot of work actually I I draw this I draw for you this uh schema that can be maybe too technical for you but is very important for me you know. And uh that's it so I won't go into details about that but uh these are my preferences to use uh that kind of components. So. So the the main components you see here are the cheapest I have found and yeah th you have always a compromise with uh reliability and uh i if it's expensive  but uh this one was not this one also really uh reliable um so yeah that's it for the working design  uh I hope you get clearer view on uh what what a remote control is uh in terms of uh technical components but maybe yeah No no no no we we will uh This is a preference but we can always change uh Yeah. Of course yeah. Yeah. We will use uh infrared protocol uh using yeah infrared and uh and of course we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists and but we what we can do is uh uh adapting the the chips inside uh to the best uh chips and uh infrared bubbles. Um. Okay. The frequencies? Yeah yeah. Of course yeah in the chip you have it yeah. That can control o other things. Yeah. Of course yeah we should take that into account in the uh Yes. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yep. These are kind of next generation functionalities. Mm 'kay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Or even you don't need to download it  it's streamed uh online uh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Fourteen or for O okay. So Mm-hmm. Yeah. Because they are already used to that  you know  product. Yeah. Mm-hmm. ... Yes. Mm-hmm. Yep. Yeah we have yeah twelve point five Euros uh per uh per R_ s R_C_ and I think uh with this now you know that chips are very uh cheaps and uh we can include it in our control some new new features. Yeah. And um But yeah that's Ye I don't think L_C_D_ is not necessary well  th for long term. Yeah. Universal. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah because we have to take into account that we are gonna b we are gonna sell uh four aro around four million so when we speak about these numbers uh the price of a chip is uh price of a chip is very cheap. So I'm okay for designing um a ne uh less yeah a a kind of universal uh R_C_ yeah. Yeah. Yeah that's needed  yeah. And if we want to get the market  we really need that. Yes. Exactly. Is that okay for you? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Oh that's that's fine then. Yeah. Okay perfect. So I see all everybody's here  'kay. And we can start meeting. The I will uh present here agenda with with with with slides to you. Um as you can see here. So first uh just to mention I will take notes uh of this meeting and uh I will try to work them out and give them to you. I've also made notes of the previous meeting and um I was about to send them you but then uh I had to go to this uh meeting so you will get them too uh Um. Yes. Indeed. Um. Then I hope you all have uh worked out some some uh some some presentations about uh about well you the the task given to you in the previous meeting. Um. W We will uh in a minute we will uh start with them. Um  we will see in which order we will handle them of. Um then I will uh bring in some some some new requirements I I got uh from the uh account manager  I try to work them out  they were quite abstract  and we can have maybe have com some discussion about it. Uh Um about the functions and Well in this meeting we should really try to reach a decision about the target group and the functionality of the Yes I mean well yes w who are we going to uh to well to sell this  the customers  indeed yes. Think that's that's important matter. Uh. So And then uh we will close this meeting uh and after this meeting we'll uh we'll have a lunch. Good. Um. Maybe um why uh Anna can you c do you have a presentations? You don't have presentation? Uh you want a table to to uh Yes yes maybe maybe you can uh can just talk about it or maybe you can use the whiteboard if necessary um. Mm-hmm. Mm. Do you Do you have this uh information on the web page you said? Yes  mayb maybe you can can send an email to me later uh. Uh about this. Mm. Mm. Yes yes  I have that too. Mm. Mm. They think that or do their doctor the doctor says? But it's it's the opinion of the uh of the users huh? So mm. You can maybe just just Hmm. Mm-hmm. D do you have numbers o o on that? Well it would it would be a solution for uh when your remote control is lost  I mean when it has speech recognition then uh i then it doesn't matter where it is  my well it's we should be in range  or maybe it can respond and produce sound  so say where it is. But the these are all quite fancy features I'm not sure whether we will we can make this for for twelve Euro fi and fifty cents. Mm. Yes  that that that that's mm. Do you have some more important facts or can we go to the next presentation? Mm. Mm-hmm. Decline with age  mm. Mm. Yes. We will talk about it later. Okay. Mm. Okay. um Uh maybe uh Mael c c can you give uh uh your presentation uh? Oh  this is Mm-hmm  y y you can move  uh. Yes. You can you can sa take my chair. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Is huh overwhelming. No. And and why do you want these kind of component? I mean  are they cheap  or are they uh reliable? What were your Mm. Yes. It it it's more clear now I think. So Mm-hmm. What I w what I was thinking about uh the the the schema uh about uh the sender and the receiver  I mean can you can you get back to it? Yeah uh  the receiver is of course already in the television and we are not uh able to change it. So we we must adapt to the to the receiver. I I suppose there is a standard uh way of communicating to televisions uh. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yes. Okay. Thank you. Mm. Yeah yes I I I I I feel I I I think M Mael will will consider this uh th these things. Maybe Maybe we can go to to your presentation uh Matthew. I I I assume you were finished here. Uh okay. Oh. I Uh  sorry? I know where it is. It's uh Yes. It's uh Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm mm mm mm mm. Mm yes  but I think it's i i it's already there  I mean the hard disk uh recorders uh I I've seen them in the shop. W w w w we need to decide on on on on in how far we go to in this. Mean  you can go pretty far I f I think with with with functions and possible uh future p uh prospects yes. But it's good to keep in mind. Mm. Very well. Good. Um  so u um I have uh received some some some some well points of of thinking over of my account manager and uh I would like to share them with you. Um first thing is uh teletext is a well known feature of televisions but it's it's getting used less and less. That's that's especially because of the internet of course. So we should think about it um. Do we include it  and do we give it a prominent uh prominent uh place on on on the on well huh on the remote mot control itself. Uh as uh a in any case it's it's not used  well very much  but it's it is still used. Um further yes we must think  uh do we stay uh to to television only  the television as we as we all know it with with broadcasting signals and you can't go back uh huh  or do we uh uh go further as Matthew indicated by supporting uh uh recording uh devices? Uh indeed indeed. And and and the hard disk recorders. Um  furthermore  uh  w we need really need to interest uh y younger customers and then with younger customers I mean people uh below the age of forty  and our our current customers are mainly forty plus uh which well Forty. So that's to that's I mean there's a market but uh they will grow older older and you'll al always need to have the the future with younger people. Um therefore  younger people like trendy trendy designs  so that's w we should make our our our R_C_ as trendy as possible but it should also be uh have a reliable image  so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all. Hmm. Ma Maybe Maybe you can draw it on the on the board uh Hmm. Yes yes mo Yes it's recognisable Mm mm. And and they are skilled uh by using it. Mael can you hand me over this uh? Uh thank you. Mm well I think fi five min Mm-hmm. Okay. 'Kay I I think now that the idea's clear. Uh we should now uh try to decide um on our target group. Of course they have already one. So our our our remote control has to be better. Mm-hmm. Mm. I well I think many people said uh in your in in your research uh uh uh the appearance of the uh R_C_ is is important when they are buying one but Indeed. So that will be about functionality Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. So your you think we should go for a more u universal high-performance What do What do you think about What componen I don't know. I don't know whether that's necessary. Is the L_C_D_ screen I think thi this could be this could be a market because uh universal remote controls uh tend to be uh quite expensive. S so we can try to go in between  and offer a product which is not as expensive and not as complicated but but still but still people have the idea this is more functional than a normal uh uh R_C_ because it has more uh it it is in some kind universal. Mm yes but w we're targeting I think on more on the on the twenty to forty group. People yes. Who just have or already have a job and have the money but may not want to spend that much money on a on a universal universal control. Uh well I think uh when we think it over I thi I think we are trying to offer the a kind of universal control for for less money. So d Do you agree? Mm-hmm. You think it's possible for the twelve Euro fifty? Okay. Um so then we we decide on on on going to this more universal kind of control. Mm. Mm. Okay. Yes. Mm mm mm mm. So given we are going for this uh uh universal type uh m maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need and y you will try to get more specific uh user interface content and uh maybe you can look on on what trends are in this uh in this type of market. So anyone uh has a point to bring in or shall we no. Okay. W yes  we uh we can have lunch now. So um Then th th the next meeting will uh after lunch you have uh we have uh thirty minutes of work and then we have the next meeting. But you will be informed via the computer. Okay. Mm-hmm. What's the agenda for this meeting? Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Yeah. That's the big question yeah. No  I don't. I wasn't. No. I c I can talk about it but I have no slides or anything. Mm-hmm. Well I've just been um presented with some research we've done in a small focus group so  a hundred people  just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control. Um. It's probably can't email this to you  I've just got a web page with some data on it. Um basically it's saying that users generally dislike the look and feel of their remote controls. Um seventy five u seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly. Um. Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy. Um. Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user. Uh seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot  so they use their remote control quite frequently while they're watching television. Uh. Fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons  so they've got a remote control with a lot of functionality but really most of the time they only use a small part of that. Um. I have an a web page yes. Yep. Yep  sure. Mm-hmm. So basically um there's a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control. Um  power and volume selection are only used a few times within this uh per hour. Um  channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times um and then there's things like channel settings  audio settings  which are only used very infrequently. Um. Teletext is used um fourteen times in the hour  so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used. Um. An interesting thing that this report has brought up is that um fifty fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room  so some way of some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users. Um. Thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control  they want something that's easier to use straight away  more intuitive perhaps. Um. Thirty four percent said it took too much time to learn to use a new one. Yep. Um. And thirty twenty six percent said remote controls are bad for R_S_I_. I don't know how we'd go about combating that. For R_S_I_? Respet Repetitive strain injury. So. But Mm. Yeah. That's what the report says yeah. Um and then it's got a demographic breakdown on Uh I should be able to actually  if I email it to you now. Oh no  yeah. Yeah. Um  s hang on. Well. Oh I need to muck around with this. It's probably easier if you put it on yours and then I'll just email it to you. It's just a web link. One thing it goes on to talk about  which is interesting  is the hang on a minute. Mm-hmm. Yep. Um  one thing is interesting is talking about um speech recognition in a remote control. And who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful. Yes  I'll just get this up. Well potentially yeah  um I think even for interesti yeah I think that would not work so well. You wanna have both options. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Um Well This is now talking about um who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control  who would pay more for it  um. Ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more  it goes down from there  seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five  thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five  um twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five. Yeah. But we sh Yeah  it really depends where we're gonna be targeting this product  um  which we'll be talking about later I think. Did you get the email? Yep  that one. Just follow that link. It'll be in a different window  yep. That's left that one. Yep. Mm. So that's the figure that I was just talking about there  with the different demographics. Another thing it's talking about there is the L_C_D_ screen but there's no figures apparently on that. Sorry? Oh. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Well. You drew it a long time ago? Ninety one. Ah. That's handy. So if the b T_V_ in the next apartment's really loud  you can just turn it off. Yeah. I like that idea. Mm-hmm. Yep. Mm-hmm. Okay. How would that work? So you've got say maybe a V_C_R_ and a T_V_ which are separate  so you on my one at home I've got a V_C_R_ remote which then changes the channel on the V_C_R_ and doesn't do anything on the T_V_  so is it gonna be like a switch on the remote that says t use the T_V_ or use the V_C_R_? or does it know which one you want to use? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. That's fair enough. Mm. But I don't think we're trying to make a universal remote here. That's  yeah. Mm. Mm. Because y Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Yep. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Mm. Mm. So D_V_D_s and V_C_R_s? Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Mm. But I think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting  especially if we're going after a younger market  that's the the the mm the new and the funky things  that's  yeah  there's lot there's lots of pretty mobile phones  not too many pretty remote controls. That's Mm. Mm-hmm. Okay. How much longer have we got for the meeting by the way? 'Cause we haven't talked about demographic at all and it's a very important issue. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Which I think is quite tricky. Um  basically we're trying to get people to buy a remote control wouldn't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one? But it's not going to have more functionality  'cause it's only a low market  it's a cheap-end remote control  we can't beat modern functionality  we might we'll be able to beat them on th the look of it  th the design of it but that's not a big seller  if they're not just going to buy a new remote control just 'cause it looks pretty  they have to actually need it as well. So I'm not sure how we can get people to buy this thing. Mm. Yeah. But why are they buying one in the first place? Mm. But if people are buying a new remote control for functionality they'll buy a universal remote. I've got friends who've got so many things they need a universal remote  otherwise they're using five different remotes for their all their things. In that case they wouldn't buy our product  because it doesn't give them what they need in terms of functionality. Well  we can't  with the price range. We We're not building a universal remote  we're not building a high end product. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. But yeah. If we're getting into universal remote territory  we're getting to L_C_D_ screens and things like that which would drive the cost up a lot. For universal remotes If you mm. And quite complicated to use  yes. Mm-hmm. Not as flexible maybe  yeah  but s yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But if we're going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own T_V_s to use a remote control on. Okay. So they're yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yep. I don't know really what the the price range for remote controls is. Are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range  or are we kind of middle to bottom? I don't know. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. So I guess what I'd like from a universal remote is maybe choosing between three devices  being able to switch between them  there may be stereo  V_C_R_ and T_V_. And just be able to s use them all from the same remote  but not at the same time. Mm. Mm-hmm yep. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. ,The project manager opened the meeting and stated the agenda to the team members. The marketing expert discussed the findings of a survey which indicated that current remotes are ugly  difficult to use  have a number of unused buttons  frustrate users when misplaced  and contribute to RSI. The marketing expert also stated that young users like speech recognition and that users in general want buttons for power  channel selection  volume control  and a few lesser used settings. The user interface designer presented existing remotes to exemplify the need for simpler designs  discussed the use of components such as titanium and a back-lit LCD screen  and discussed other features to consider such as color options. The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and how to handle universal capability and speech recognition. After the project manager's closing  the project manager recapped some decisions and the team discussed how to handle the issue of locating a remote when misplaced.
