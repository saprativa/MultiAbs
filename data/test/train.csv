Morning. Yep. My name's Frank. Thank you. Hmm  that's interesting. Sure. Yep. Visit it. Can't say I paid much attention to it  but Oh yeah. Okay. 'Kay. That was interesting. Innocent. 'Kay. I'm thinking about a swordfish.. Meat. Yeah. Hmm. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Gonna use a different line width. And I'm gonna draw in black. There. 'Kay  I'm not much of an artist  but here we go. Mm. Okay. This is my um Hmm. Sheep. With of course little blue dot they always get sprayed on their butts. There. Yeah. 'Kay. They are Come on. You have to go really slow when you're writing. They're brilliant animal animals. And that's just a little me thingy. So. Guess I'll pass the pen to our User Interface Designer. Interesting. A rabbit? Garfield. Yeah. Yeah. And the most interesting tail. Yeah. We're being haunted. Yeah  you got a message. So just on a side note  why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen? Yeah. Right. No. It's off now. Well  it was on  but Ah  there we are. Well  we have a kind of broad T_V_ at home  and a D_V_D_ player  so we got like a lot of remote controls  one for the T_V_  one for the video recorder  one for the D_V_D_ player. And I think it's it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all. Oh really. Yeah. Yeah. So I think you can take minutes again. Since it's your job. Yeah. Yeah. But that would be really good if we could do that. Um. Think it has to be shock proof 'cause my remote control tends to fall a lot. So Yeah  one other little thing. Thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it. So you can see how much is left in the battery. But they'll also really drag up the production costs  so think we'll have to see about that too. But maybe just a little LED  I don't know. Um. Nope  don't think so. Okay. Aye sir. Half an hour. Okay. Morning. Mm-hmm. Garfield. Well I was gonna draw a cat too  so. I'll just try something else. Something different than Garfield. Mine is a bit more skinny. But uh Well  it's supposed to be a cat. I like cats because uh they are uh independent. The pen. So. The pen. No  me neither. Nope. They were all mentioned  so Okay. Morning. I'm. Yep. Hmm? Okay. Yeah. Yep. Hmm. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Hmm. A sheep. Okay. Um I'm just gonna draw its uh head  but mm Let's see. Mm. Uh. Okay. Yeah. You know what that is? Or who? Ah okay  yeah. Just a Mm. Guess. So uh Yeah. That's enough. Um  you say a blank  or Okay. Five minutes  okay. Mm? Mm. Oh really? Huh. It's a Sure. Yeah. Okay  yeah. Yeah. Okay  yeah. Hmm. Oh. Mm-hmm. Oh. Mm. Mm-hmm. Sure  yeah. Waterproof  or uh Uh  you never no know uh  I w I mean uh 'Kay. Okay  yeah. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Okay. Yep. So uh good morning. I see you all find your places. Is everybody sitting on the right place? Yeah? I guess so. So Let's see. First I will introduce myself. I don't know if uh if everybody knows me  so I'm Bart  hello. Hello. Bart. Hello. Hello. Bart. Welcome. Uh let's see. Uh let's start off um with a little presentation. Uh Now first I'll tell you a little bit about the setting. You can see there are a few cameras here. They'll record uh our actions and you'll have wires and microphones that will record your voice. Uh there are also some microphones there but th um you don't have to pay a lot of attention on those  because it will uh disappear when you don't attend to it. So is there a project documents folder? There are some notes in it already I see  some documents. Uh I'll start with the presentation kick off. Is being modified by the administrator. Uh okay. Let's do it read only. Well I don't know if you've noticed  but uh we're working for Real Reaction. Uh it's a company in uh electronics. We put fashion in electronics  uh we make it work  uh we put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself. I'm Bart the project manager so I'll direct you through the project. This is our agenda. Uh we have our opening acquaintance  tool training  project plan description closing. Uh maybe I can sit down  then I can take some notes or Let's see. Maybe you can take the minutes once in a while. I dunno it's not a lot of work  but just uh if you hear something uh you can write down  just write it down. Uh as you can see uh it's the opening  aquaintance tool training. Aquaintance is a point we've done a bit. Um have you all seen the corporate website already? Yeah. Have you seen any flaws in it? I think I found one. No? I can see if it works this way. No  it doesn't work here. Okay no problem. But um on the corporate information side there's a th uh there was Real Remote instead of Real Reaction. Real Remote is not really the company we're we are  but it's just a little fault. Um okay  what are we going to do? Uh our project aim is as you can see a new remote control. It has to be original  trendy  and user friendly. So these are uh the points why uh we also hired you. We've got the Marketing Expert for uh the trendy and user friendly look. And Industrial Designer uh there's also user friendly and a bit original. And we've got our User Interface Designer. He's also uh That's about the new remote control. Uh project method um is uh there are three phases we are going through. First is functional des uh design  individual work  meetings. After the functional design  then the conceptual design and the detailed design. I had some role indications on here. But I think you know it already by yourself. The Industrial Designer is going to work on the working design  uh components design and a bit of the look and feel design. Uh the User Interface Designer is going to do the technical function design  user interface concept and user interface design. And the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification  trend watching and project uh product ev evaluation. So that's a bit what you're going to do. But that will be all worked out in uh other meetings. Then we've got our first tool training. We are going to work with a lot of high-tech tools here  so it's ab it's handy if we have a little bit of training first. As you can see we've got the smart boards here and here in the white board. Um in the white board here there's a little tool bar on this side. Here are some functions. You can save. N uh these functions we don't have anything to do with  only undo  you can undo a little uh piece of drawing. A blank new document for each person. Uh select a pen  eraser. Capture we don't have to do anything with. Uh then we've got our pen. This pen. It's really funny because you can draw with it on this page um in the think it is form of. You can also select the current colour and the line width. But then first you have to select the pen function. But we're going to work with it in a minute. So okay. Uh that's very simple and it's easy to uh draw your findings and drawings on there. Uh then a short thing about documents. We've got our shared folder  uh project project what was it? Project documents I think. But all you will found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already  so it will be okay. And these are available on the smart boards as well  so if you have a document you wanna show  just open it from the folder. Here is a simple tool bar. It's what I just said  it's save  print  move back or forward one page. You can switch between the different drawings. And then we're going to try out the white board. So as you can see we g all going to draw a animal. Just to uh uh just to get a bit familiar with it. Mouse wasn't running away. Is everybody is anybody playing with the mouse? No. Okay. We're going to uh draw animal. And uh just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics. Um the only thing we have to uh look after is that we use different colours  and different line width. Uh there's I can start from now. I will. You can use this pen by holding it like a like a little child. Because if you hold it like this  the sensors will get blocked and then the drawing won't get good. Another thing is you have to be uh a bit slow. 'Cause if you're going to draw like really fast then um the pen won't hold up. So we choose form of current colour uh I think grey is appropriate. Then the line width. I think seven will be nice. Now you'll see my drawing capabilities. These are not very much  but uh Uh  see you have to do it real slow. Oh Ah I was trying to draw a dolphin  but I think his nose has to be a little bit But it's close. So what yeah it's this is bit of the swordfish. Yeah  he hasn't got an eye. Woah. Now we've got another function. We've got the eraser. And then you can undo this easily. Ah it's okay. And I've got to write down a few of its characteristics. Uh is They've got no text tool  no. Uh. Okay. This is typically a undo action  I think. Pen. Maybe you have to hold it a bit upside-down. I think that's it because if you wan ar are going to do it like this then it will be a stripe. But I don't know  I'm just trying. This is not my work  okay. Maybe you have to use Oh. Uh. I think it's a it wants to draw a another animal? I don't know. It lives for the fun. So It's my characteristic uh characteristic about the dolphin. It lives for the fun. So now I'm gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you. Go ahead. Maybe it's easier to draw the smaller line width  I think. Because this is going a lot better than uh I did. It's nice. Uh. It's a real dead sheep  yeah. For recognition  yeah  I see. Um maybe you can also write your name somewhere. On just a Yeah. Nice. Sweet. Yeah  just a blank sheet. No. Yeah  it's pretty skinny cat. Is your cat  or did you find him on the street? Ah. Okay. That's pretty clear. So everybody knows how to work with the white board now? So if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the white board  just ask and go ahead. It's pretty uh easy. 'Kay. S haunted white board. So we've got the tool uh introduction. We move along to the project finance. Um as you can see  we um for our remote control  a selling price is uh twenty five Euros. Our selling price. Uh our profit aim is fifty million Euros. Uh that's the least we have to get from our remote controls  so we have to work together to reach our aims. Uh we can do it international  so we have to focus on different kind of users  different kind of cultures  and different kind of trends as well. Um but that's all in the later stadium. Our production cost um can be maximal twelve and a half Euros  so that's also a point we have to keep in mind  that we won't make remote controls with small televisions inside  and stuff like that. It won't work. So just try to remember these points. Selling price twenty five  profit aims fifty million um  but more important is the int international market we're trying to focus on. And production cost uh maximal twelve and a half Euros. So that's leads us to our little discussion. We've got about five or ten minutes left for discussion. So I'm gonna sit down  I think. It's easier. I've got a message. Five minutes. Okay  that's uh good timing. Uh maybe you have to say the magic word. Does it do anything? Maybe you have to just clap it down? Mm back up again. No slide show. Hmm. It's off. Now you have to put it back o Oh yeah. You'll be okay  I think. Well it's those laptops. Nice. Okay. But so mm does everybody has um experiences with uh remote controls  and I mean not the ordinary mote controls  but also a little bit different ones? Like you can use for other? No? You? Ah yeah. Yep. Yeah I've I've got one at home. And you can uh program I think eight different devices in it  and you can use it for your television  anything else. And it also operates on infra-red  so you have to got the little device inside your room  and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor. So that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or D_V_D_ player downstairs and you've got a link to your T_V_ on the second floor. So that's a pretty handy um thing. Um but only the I think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control  it makes it a lot easier as well. It's uh That's good to remember. Yeah  that's nice  I think. So we've we want different functions uh and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra-red. But I don't know if that will exceed the production costs. So that uh that's something we have to find out  I think. And other functions for a remote control? Maybe we can make it uh uh Shock proof. Sure. Waterproof. Okay. So these are our um a few things we can think of. Um I will put the minutes from this meeting uh in our project folder. That's a battery stays. Yeah. Uh. That's an idea as well. Other ideas? Quick ideas. Okay. Any questions about this uh presentation? Kick off presentation. No? Okay  then I'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder  and then we can all work. Finish meeting now. Okay. And we can all work uh on our own projects. Okay then I'll meet you in about a half an hour  I think. So good luck. ,The project manager opens the meeting and presents the agenda using slides. The marketing expert explains the research she read about  which is a study done on 100 people asking their remote usage habits and preferences. The Industrial Designer presents  explaining the basic function of a remote control and how it works. He says they should first agree on the technical functions before he creates working design and chooses the chips and infrared components to build it. The Interface Designer gives his presentation  talking about the remote's technical function of sending a message to the TV set that is decoded by the TV. Standard TV remotes have an on/off button  play  volume change  number keypad  and a 1 or 2 digit option. He suggests that in aiming for the next generation they should have a remote for the TV and video integrated together. The project manager recieves a message from account manager  which he shares with the group. They discuss and determine the target group as well as the possibility of making a universal remote for stereo  VCR  and TV. They close the meeting with the project manager telling each group member what they will do before the next meeting. 
Okay. Everybody ready? Welcome at the functional design meeting  again presented by Maarten. Uh this is the agenda  the opening. Uh  we've got three presentations. And I'm gonna show you some of the new projects requirements that were sent to me. And we're gonna make a decision on the remote control functions. We have uh forty minutes. Oh  well this is the the closing already. So uh well we start off with the th the first presentation then. Uh  I think um in uh we have to do it in uh in right order. Maybe the Well  it Oh that. It won't doesn't Maybe we should start with the the technical functions. Yeah? Well it's you dumped the file in the uh in the sh in the project document folder. You've already done that? Well let's close this one. We'll just uh open a new one. Uh  well. Yes. Uh-oh. New thing. Oh yeah  uh I have to say something. Uh  due to some uh technical problems I haven't uh digitized the last uh the meeting minutes. But I'll uh make sure that uh happens next time. And I'll get this one uh in digital uh form too. Okay. Okay. Okay. But it's the technical side of the remote control. Oh. Okay. Well  we'll we'll have to skip that part then. But you don't think it's a problem um to design uh the technical part of the remote control? It's gonna be easy? Okay. Yeah. M Okay. R regardless of what type of functions we want to implement. Doesn't really matter. Okay. Yeah  okay. Okay. Well  we'll see. We'll see later on. No. Well  uh will there be some uh user requirements later on? The ones I I've uh received from the account manager. Yeah. Well  we'll keep this in mind  and then discuss it later on. Uh-huh. Okay  but this real this uh big d uh distinction between this type of remote. we should we should choose one uh we should not compromise but uh really choose for uh expert viewer or novice v Yeah? Well  what that's what you want trying to say. Okay. Okay. Yeah  well some of these Uh  yeah. Well  some of that will Yeah  but i but it will be more clear when we come to the uh u uh some of the new requirements. So Mm-hmm. Okay. Well  then the Marketing expert can uh tell us something about the current market. Okay. Visually presents. Okay. Well  then we I'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements and then we gonna discuss on uh what features we find important. Uh  well some of the uh new requirements make some of your findings quite uh irrelevant  I think. Because um uh s decided to put They have decide to put two additional requirements forward. Well  now I see four. That's kinda strange. Well  they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet. Well  I think that may be so  but well  we can't just leave the teletext button off. It's impossible  I think. So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button  you know  like on and off  and don't make a lot of special put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or You know  it's just you want you want to be able to make use of teletext  but not to play with it that much. So we have to think of that. The remote control should only be used for television. Otherwise  the project becomes more complex  which endangers the time t t ma uh the time to market. So maybe we should leave all D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ related features off completely. I don't know. I think that uh that's what they're trying to say. Uh  our current customers are within the age group of forty plus. New products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty. So you uh talked about the elderly who were willing to spend more on a remote control and who were interested. But  well  they're not relevant because we are aiming at a younger Yeah  but it is it's is a dif it's a fact that the th th that bigger market you're talking about  we already cover that. Our company already sells remote control to the older people  but we we also want  you know  a new customer group. That's the one we haven't covered yet. So I think that's what the problem is. We haven't got remote controls for uh Well I think  yeah. Yeah  I think so. Maybe if it's no no  but I think we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants. So maybe we can make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group  but isn't that bad for an older person either. Uh  our corporate image sh should stay recognisable in our products. Our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design. Okay  something else nice to know. Sorry? Yeah  you will have to look that up. I think it's something about the Oh  okay. I thought it w might be  let's make things better or something  but Okay well  let's go back to the the agenda. So we've now had to the three presentations. We know about the new project requirements. That means we can uh well d yeah  discuss on the remote control functions. Well  if I can uh make a start  I think it's becoming more clear what kind of remote control it's gonna be  and I already talked about the maybe you have a f familiar with the rem remote control that has the the can opener underneath it. I think we're we're looking for some Yeah  we we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic T_V_ functions. Y well  that Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  yeah. M yeah  that's why um well a lot of um the use the requirements the the account manager sent me  I think they are are c are contradicting each other  because they want a simpler design  and no uh other uh s functions than just T_V_  but they s do aim at a younger Well  ma But I think uh you we can make some discuss uh distinctions in uh what kin in the  know  th th in functions you have Y Well you have different kind of uh equipment in your room  like a t T_V_ and a D_V_D_ player. You can uh  know  you you can make very d you can put very detailed functions regarding the T_V_ set on your remote control uh with the with uh the  you know  audio settings and uh v uh screen settings. We don't want that. I think that was that became clear. We don't want. But w maybe we should put some func uh  I know that the younger people will most likely have a D_V_D_ player they want to  you know  they want to uh control  remotely. No  yeah  th th the user requirements of the the The new project requirements told us not to But maybe w Yeah. I think we maybe should Yeah  well we should uh put some functions for other maybe for other equipment on it. But just the basic functions. Maybe like rewind and wind  or n what d what do you guys think? Yeah  if as far as possible. But what do you think? Do th should we implement features that uh uh or functions that to control other devices? No  you don't think so? Yeah  the new requirements say so. Well  maybe it's maybe there there there is something th m most of the time these functions don't support the particular device as well as their their own remote control. You know  a lot of D_V_D_ players have some tricky settings with Yep  exactly. That's that's wha No no  you don't No no  you don't need it. No  no. Okay  but we have to think uh w we have to think D_V_D_ I th uh  I guess  so um but uh from my experience it's kinda a lot of D_V_D_ players  you know  like forwarding  goes differently. Uh  you get two speed or eight speed or sixteen speed. It's c sometimes a bit difficult. Maybe if we just leave the D_V_D_ functional m uh Well  I was thinking about putting it in  but concerning the project requirements and what you just said  I think we m should focus on the T_V_ then. And uh and it's just an uh a complimentary remote and not a universal one. If you want to keep it simple  you can make a universal remote. Okay. It's just a s it it should be something that is like a gadget on your coffee table  and it's just for when you you you jump on the couch  you pick up the the the nice remote  the simple one  just to put on the television  nothing more. Okay. Um  but what televis Yeah  we we'll make w this one trendy. And simple. Well  we we will come to that  but ju first on the on the functions. So we should put uh zap buttons on it. Um  also numbers  to uh to go to the specific channels. Uh  Okay  a t a teletext button should be there. But just one big teletext button  on and off. Probably. Oh  okay. Yeah  but uh I think that becomes too difficult  it's not a very common function and people will have to read up on their remote then. Yeah  yeah  but maybe you s yeah yeah  maybe y you do  but I've never heard of it in the first place. And we have to well t yeah  and t and teletext is becoming outdated. We just want to see what programmes are on and what time it is probably. Yeah. I don't know. I think that that's kin getting too complex for our remote. I don't know what you th guys think. Yeah  but do you like to have a such a s stop button? Or do you think it uh I think it's a kind of uh uh very rare and special function. Yeah. Okay  it goes Yeah  but that's kind of stuff we should do on the internet right now. That's why it was uh said in the in the use in the r new requirements. Well yeah uh  lots of new televisions can store pages  you know  and then you can just skip manually through them using I think we should just put one teletext button on it. Then we meet uh the new requirements. we also meet the other thin y you sh you just re we have to choose for the the simple design  I guess. Okay. Um  well  what functions do we have to decide on? Or do we uh I dunno if we have t stif specifically name all the functions we n we want. We have the zap and uh the volume. Should we do m make them very big? The the the zap button. D d Th that's that's that's considered to be trendy also. Or maybe you should place them on a uh  in a special way? Yeah  something or uh somethin special way to to zap through the it has to s it has to be yeah  and quick. You have to use it very quickly. Yeah  and it the buttons should make it um possible to to zap through your channels in a rapid at a rapid pace. Oh  what should we decide on then? I think in a in a case of this simple remote control  the technical aspects which uh weren't worked out already  but it w shouldn't be a problem then. Yep. No  okay  but we don't have to uh  when we don't want to uh control other devices  I think it makes it even more simple. I think I think that we should use uh d yeah  not not uh the b the watch kind th the most uh Well  it has to be simple  and I wi Which are most likely to be found somewhere in the house  you know. Oh. How much time do we ha we have left uh? M m m more than thirty minutes? Uh ten twenty minutes. Well  uh these these shouldn't Yeah. Yeah  okay. But that's that's Do you uh have you have you think about tha thought about that? How we can what the extra touch can be. Do you suggest design or the shape or some gadget f f kind of feature or Well  it was something about how we lose them. Maybe it should be a remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. Nah  um a lot of people like to have such kind kind of kind of gay kind of things. It w it w should be like a birthday present or something that you give someone  and it is i has something nice. Or maybe it w should have a big uh light that can flash or something on it  or maybe it should or an or the like the the can opener. Maybe it contains some feature that you don't normally link to a remote control. I think it's very impor because we're gonna make such a basic remote control  we have to do something to make it special. It's gonna cost twenty five Euros. Yeah  but the well  it's already been done. Nah. Yeah  that's true. But and I think it's gonna be uh very uh it has to be sturdy or something  so maybe with with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something. it has to be used something special  and you really it has to  you know y not s people  when they buy it  they have to think  well this one lasts for a long time. We're really gonna use them. Not some thing you you throw away next week  you know. So maybe uh that's i I think that's when uh when we decide on these type of functions  know  basic functions  uh it's very important to find something like this. So there's a very important task for you. And maybe we can all think about it. Uh  also for you maybe  when t you it's very nice when you can be entra when you can be trendy  and and uh and al as in a friend use friendly as well  you know. So big buttons  flashy design  and maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing. Uh-huh. Yeah  or just different colours would be uh I don't know if people also wanna spend more money on fronts for their uh remote control. It could be be Yeah  you never know  but But it and I think we have to make it quite big. Yeah  people So  and and also because uh it is expensive. If you want it to be something  you know  it's ha doesn't have much functions want to be you don't want to get it l make it Mm-hmm. And shou and should ni look nice when you put it on a table. I I think you m might wanna put it uh yeah  that it it it it stands up. Yeah  you have to put it on its So it's like a vase or uh something you put on a table. no no  put stuff inside it. But  it's like like a statue or something Yeah yeah  but yeah  but you also can put it somewhere near the window in That it's it's fashionable. I I don't Oh  yeah. Yeah  but but when you when it gets lost  how can you press the button to make it Oh  okay. Uh  that's kind of nice. And then also you don't even need batteries  because you can make it uh chargeable. Yeah  that w yeah  but yeah  the pro No  well I think that it might be t p Well  nee but we don't Yeah. Maybe you  but we don't know much about production cost  but when you you can imagine that when you spend twenty five Euros on a remote control and it's a basic remote control  then the then the money there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know  rechargeable units. Yeah  but we would d ma we'd do it in Taiwan and So  it's not gonna be that expen Uh I I think it's a great idea. S some kind of be I've never seen that before  and you make it uh um be uh  you see it with uh the mo the mouses nowadays. Well  I well it's really ch you can recharge it  so you ha never have the battery problem. That's one. And uh you can always find your remote control up Uh  okay. Well  maybe yeah  you could when that's when it's too costly  you could probably skip the recharger  but you will you do need uh also an uh  also you would need a battery in the the base unit as well  you know. Does it makes it kinda Yeah  yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah  but then it's very easy to make it also a rechargeab I don't think that is gonna cost much to make it also a recharge function in it. Yeah. I think it's a good idea. And make it  you know  we we um Well  we uh it's it isn't a t a most uh costly uh remote control. We can save on the on the functions. We just put some simple button in  make it big and sturdy  nothing more  and just make s sure there's some noise that it can make  or probably some kind of cheap light thing around it or that it uh that it lights up  it's also nice. And if you put it away  I think it's uh w we have to we uh that's uh it's not a easy market. We have to something special. And for twenty five Euros people want something remote c special from your mote control  and we can't deliver that in r with uh regards to the functions  because we aren't gonna put Yeah. And then uh when make it  you know  nice looking shape and this and then you also you got the stand-up thing. Yeah. I think I think it's a good idea. Yeah. Oh  if it let's well  we will see what's possible concerning the the costs  and if it's possible we'll do that. And we even try to save up on other stuff to make sure we can do such a thing. And the first thing we the most likeable thing to to n to skip is then probably the recharge function or something. If that's too expensive  we won't do that. But it would be nice. It's the idea. I know that batteries last long nowadays. And and what people just think about  well  I'll never have to buy any r batteries again  so y b because it's very annoying when your battery is empty. And you know then when you haven't batteries around  and probably for two weeks  your remo I've experienced that that Yeah  okay. So  easy functions. Well  we will we will I think we'll work that out  zapping  numbers on it  bi Yeah. But it's also annoying. 'cause as long as it stays as it ke keeps working  you're not very motivated to do something about it. Then it beeps all the time and. You don't want to have ever have those problems  and you won't have if if you have the rechargeable. And you don't have to use the unit  you can also put it on the side if people don't like it. Uh  i i in the in the ma Yeah  but it w I mean  if if they pay for it because they think  oh  that's a great idea  I'm gonna use it. And when it  you know  when time goes by and they think  well  I'll never put him in the recharger  I think last long enough  then they put it on side and they can use it now and then. Then when they look get m I I I know for sure that everybody who buys this remote control  within a couple of months of they will be in the situation that they they're seeking for the remote control  they wanna see something quick and uh just push the button and th uh  I think it's brilliant. Yeah  I've never it's so simple  but I've never seen it. M maybe we should really do this. Okay now  well  how much time have we got left? These clocks aren't uh synched. Oh  now I've put uh well  it is twenty p Okay  so we have ten minutes or something? Yeah  but we're uh we're done. I think. We've decided on the functions. Well  there is some oh. There is a closing sheet. We have lunch break  and then we have thirty minutes of individual work. Oh okay  I'll make sure I'll I had some problems with uh the digitising the the first minutes  the the s the next minutes won't be a problem  but I'll try to make sure the first one will be in the folder too  but maybe it won't work  but you'll see. I think these are more important than the first ones  so. Oh  five minutes. Yeah  because uh I I d I did uh the first minutes I did were were were a bit scratchy  you know. Then I did a s second one with a nicer layout  which I could uh  know  use for the other ones well  but uh I d think uh I forgot to do put done under the first one  and when you go write a second uh it's get it's not working when you try to write second uh paper or something. And then you you had to overwrite it or someth I don't know. Becau I d uh  it was not my uh pen. this kind of looks you like. Of the shape. Yeah  probably  it would be nice. No  bigger. Well  I I I have to say  I have this uh can opening remote control in my head most of all  or I think some maybe we should no  that will be too costly. We shou we could also  that was a would also be an idea  but I don't think it I don't know if it exists already  you should like make Alessi or something design it. That would also be nice. But that's gonna then you c then you don't Yeah  but then you don't have t yeah it that's not something i that's in the production cost a one it's a one time  you know s was it's a single cost. Yeah  m but but then you can nah  I don't thin I think that it would be more expensive  because I've bought the Alessi stuff more often and even small pencil holders or something are more expensive. Would be a nice idea though. I don't know. I think it uh has to be a r it has to have round forms or something. Like something like that or so or so And on th and then uh s a base unit underneath it. It's also round. Put it in there uh wire on it. Maybe uh  I don't know  some some lights  a big but well. Volume and programme  yeah. And some of the extra funct Some of the extra functions over here. Numbers. And and lights? How we're g well  maybe uh s a ring of no  no  you have to Maybe on the side of it. Along the side uh strip of yeah. Yeah  but I also meant the the blinking li w you know  the ones that also blink when you try to uh uh locate your remote. Well  theys have to be Yeah. Yeah  yeah. Exactly. When you you see it from the side  then it would look just like that. And then you have a strip of uh lights or something. Well  uh I think it's nice  for one thing. maybe put something on top of it or  you know  like that's looks funny. I don't know. Or some bump. Maybe some Yeah? We'll have to think about it. I think we're we're done. We can save this one. Mm mm. Yeah  that was what uh Mm  we'll hear about it. Here we go again. Oh. Okay. Mm  okay. Yeah  it's okay. Okay. No. In project. No can that open. Open it there. Okay. About the get Okay. But nothing restricted for user interface? With technical I don't know. 'Kay. Okay. But I kind of uh Yes. Uh Well  the technical functions. Um  well I don't know if you got the same uh pictures as I got  but uh I got these two  and I think they're we have to focus uh on uh the uh one hand the expert view or the novice user. th I think it's it's very much uh depending on the user requirements  I don't s uh know who's doing t Yeah  but it I think that's very important to watch uh what kind of functions there we want to uh put in a remote control. Yeah  well y we can put functions in it when uh yeah  when we uh get the user requirements uh and we can update it. Well  yeah w if you want try a a a huge market  if you want to reach a huge market  uh like elderly people and we have to choose for novice user. But I don't know. It's it's really um depending on how how how far the the the remote controls are already in n um in use. Yeah  probably  yeah. Uh well  there are l at least uh basic functions  uh like just th the channels uh one till nine  uh on and off switch  which must be clear with a red button or something like that. Um  most standard uh have volume  of course  and a mute function  and  of course  the next and previous channel. I think that's just basic what we need. And from that on we can user requirements what we need more. Uh Yeah  I just um um I thought Joost was looking at the trendy the trends in the markets  and I don't know if there uh are any um uh if you put more functions  more buttons  maybe it's com becoming less trendy or something like that. M you can just you can k you can keep it in mind that. I don't know. Uh  I th I thought the the with less buttons you can make a more trendier uh yeah  more trendier design  I think. I think. Yeah? Uh  well  that's all I have to say  I think. Yeah  that was it.. Okay. Well No way. Yeah. But what's our slogan? The slogan uh Puts fashion in electronics. Sense simplicity. Yeah. Yeah  but wha But Yeah  but you sai you said that that a lot of functions aren't used. So why should j we put this function in? I think more I think uh people younger people are more looking for just a trendy look than uh more functions. Yeah  but uh you said Yeah  d yeah  but th the functions are not in the remote control we're making. It's n Yeah. Yeah. No. No  new requirements say no. So Yeah  but I i if it's too simple uh th they won't use the remote control  they use their own th th with lot more functions. No  no. Exactly. Mm  yeah. Yeah  but just keep it simple and look more at th No. It's only for television. So Yeah. Yeah  nothing more. Exactly. Yeah. The user interface is easy. And the basic yeah  basic functions  yeah. It's too much integrated in the other. Yeah. Will you look Look at the market. Well Yeah  I uh  it's Sunday I always use it for the uh yeah  for the soccer uh Well  uh when you uh uh when you look uh for example um  a couple of weeks ago I looked at the for the flights  and there are a lot of flights in one page  so if if th Yeah  but True. A simple yeah. But trendy  yeah. I don't know. Original. It was uh True. Yeah. Maybe uh Uh maybe we uh uh the batteries maybe. If you use large batteries or small batter batteries. Yeah? Yeah. Okay. Early break. To find him. That's maybe yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  but that's yeah. Yeah. Be original  yeah. Mm-hmm. And use friendly  yeah. Yeah. Must brain-storm. Well Why not? More money for us. Yeah. Quite big. Yeah  you think? A standard or something. It's like you have uh four phones. Something like that. On the television. Oh  like this. A char chargeable. Yeah. Why not. Production. It should be possible. I think it's a good idea. To make a base or something? It's it's it's it's it's not the purpose to be handy  it's Mm. Yeah  but that's not it's ugly  I think. No. Yeah. True. Yeah. Yeah  it must be must be a gadget to have. Yeah. Yeah  we c Or just give a beep when the battery's out or uh down. Yeah. true. Yeah. Yeah. And you can leave it just there. Yeah. Yes. Yeah  I'll Uh fifteen minutes. Can you make an uh uh a part of f folder for the minutes maybe? That not not everything in one one uh folder. Yeah. Maybe. Or the sh Do you get an idea of the shape? A little bit bigger  yeah but Oh  uh look uh look at the pictures. Yeah  flash lights at the side. At the side  or something like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  side of it. Just two LEDs or something on the side. Yeah. Yeah. Well  uh probably at the side. You know look at the front  but Yeah  exactly  and then there is yeah. Yeah  something like that  yeah. No. No. Bumper or something. Yeah. Lunch break. Okay then. Okay  five uh Oh.. Oh. Oh  I got a nice little screen here over here. I got like this big black border uh on every side. I'll I'll fix it. Yeah  whatever. Yes. I don't know what the right order is. So Mm-hmm. Yes  I agree. Yeah. Yes. Yes. I haven't really found a conclusion like that. Yeah. Design. Sounds interesting. Alright. Yes. Yeah. It's alright. Um Alright  I've done some research for functional requirements. Um yes. The working method um there were hundred uh uh w h one hundred people  uh how do you say uh  f watched using remote controls in the usability lab and they also uh filled out a questionnaire uh with a few questions. Uh  I've lined them up here. Uh  ask whether um common remote control looks good or not  about willingness to spend money on remote control  about zapping behaviour  and uh and stuff like that. I uh have found some interesting things. We do we do got a market. Um  three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly. So if we make a trendy design  we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market  which you can reach. Um  three out of four users uh zaps a lot  as I uh quoted here from the uh results. Zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour. That's quite a lot. Um  relevant options are  of course  power buttons. Although  only used once per hour. Uh  channel selection  volume and buttons for text  and the more um  yeah  other functions  like audio settings  video settings  sound settings are not said to be very important and uh very much used. Furthermore  fifty percent says uh they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control. That doesn't say we got we can leave ninety percent off. But it sure um says we shouldn't make it too uh complicated. Fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room. And um an important thing here  the most important customers uh  which is over seventy percent of our market  is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old. And uh elderly people  our market  are less interested in uh nice features  but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls. So  what I was thinking oh  wrong side. We shouldn't implement too much features on uh on our remote control  because elderly people will get th lost. Group features for a higher usability  uh what I was claiming in the previous meeting. Um  all the settings  about audio settings  video settings and channel settings  which are not very often used  we could group them uh on one button and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever  because they are used very rarely and well  it uh there are a lot of options there  so we can really make uh yeah  how do you say  we can spare at buttons over there. And um  if you want to implement V_C_R_ and D_V_D_ options  group them in the button  not too uh Yeah. Small buttons  so they won't be very um  how do you say Yes  won't be very present  thank you. And a trendy look  well uh  although seventy percent of the market is uh consists of elderly people uh who don't really care for trendy looks or whatever  I guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent. That was kind of what I found. Okay. Yes. Two? No uh  I agree  I agree. Not too much  no. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. I don't really agree actually  to be honest. It's a very small market which we will approach then if we uh want to reach customers younger than forty. It's only like thirty percent of the total market. Mayb yeah? Okay. Maybe maybe we can compromise a little bit. Not too much then  bu alright. Yes. Yeah  I'll have a look. We put the fashion in electronics. Sense and simplicity. Well  to be honest  if um our uh aim group is uh till forty  not older than forty  maybe that's not very uh yeah  we don't really need to have a simple remote control. I think we can implement more functions then  because um basically uh the younger people are more able to adapt to new technology and therefore will be a more Yes. Yeah. Well  I think Yes. Yeah  control. Not much more than that. Yep. Or we can u u we could put 'em behind the flip-flap or whatever. So t Yeah. Y yes. But but for for example  V_C_R_  that's better example in this case. I think on a remote control for television you don't need to be able to programme uh the V_C_R_ to start recording at three P_M_ or whatever  just play  stop  rewind and uh fast forward. Yeah  I know  but uh Yes. Yeah. Alright. Yes  definitely  yeah. Yeah  and maybe two or three other options  but not nothing more than that. I think stop function is very useful. If you have a uh a page which consists of more pages  and you are not a very quick reader  then I think it's very irritating if the next page shows up  but Well  I use it very regularly  the action. I re I use it quite often. Might be. Might be. I think the plus and the minus button should be uh quite present  yep. Yep. If you grab the remote  your hands should be on top of the plus. Yes. I think double A_. Yep. The most ordinary uh batteries. Yep. I think about twenty minutes. I think that's n that's more for a for an age range or uh ten to twelve or whatever. Yeah  yeah  that's good one  yep. Ye I think the can opener i is a brilliant idea actually  because television and beer is not a rare combination. Yes. Yep. No  that's true. Yeah. Yeah  a swapable front or whatever. Yeah. Yes  definitely  definitely. Yes  it it it should be f be visible nearly anywhere in the room. As I uh as I said during my presentation  fifty percent uh o Yeah. A face? Or uh yeah  yeah. Yeah. Yeah  yeah  I see what you mean  yep. If you do that  but I don't know if that's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half Euros. I in in the base we could like make uh a button  and if you push it  the remote control itself s makes noise. That's probably stupid  but uh as I found here uh  fifty percent  was it fifty? Uh fifty percent fifty percent often loses remote control. No uh  of the base the the the the the the the thing you put it in. If an a button in in that uh Yeah  you can ma make rechargeable one  yeah. Why not. It should only cost twelve and a half Euros  of course. Aye? Yeah  okay. Yeah. Yes. Yes  definitely. Yeah. Well y you you could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts  of course. I don't know. On the other hand  if you don't do it  we can also make a nice bay. I mean  it looks trendy and still still put a bleep function in it  but um I think the bay is definitely uh Sure  why not. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. With eye candy  ear candy  whatever. Yeah  definitely. Yeah. Definitely  yeah. It would be nice  yes. Most televisions break down before the battery pack is empty  so yes. Yeah  why not. Hmm. No  that's true. Why not. Bleep bleep bleep  oh there it is  yeah. Yeah. No. Nearly. Yeah. Something like that  yeah. Oh. We'll see. Maarten  five minutes. No  that's true uh  yeah. Should we by the way draw um on our nice whiteboard  um a little uh idea of yeah. I dunno. Has anyone got um a little bit detailed ideas about the shape? I don't  for one. A bit bigger I guess  but The shape is nice  it's um something different  and we want we want that. Yeah. Okay  yeah. Yeah  but twelve and a half Euros? Uh Yeah. Yeah  that's true. Something like that is very ergonomic. So Yeah. Yes  volume and programme should be there I guess  because you hands wi uh y your hands will be in the smaller part. Yeah  and the numbers on top  I guess. Maybe ro roun rounds uh uh l sorry. Maybe lights also around the volume and the p the plus minus programme buttons. Oh. Okay. Yeah. Okay  yeah. I think I think that'll be too big tha too big then. Yeah. Yes  we are. Alright. Yes  I guess it's lunch time. I don't know. Half and hour? I thought our next uh next individual round was half an hour. I don't know about the lunch break. Well My mouse is not working anymore. He's uh when I put it in  is is going to beep beep beep. Huh. Okay  how can I get this on the whiteboard? Okay  I've done that. Yes. 'Kay  we're going to um uh talk about working design. Um  the method of the remote control is uh electrical energy  it activates a chip uh in the remote. It's an electrical circuit which compose uh messages in the form of uh uh infrared signals to control the television. Mm  it's a nowadays very uh known  a known uh uh technology. Um  the known technology can make a cost very low. Uh  it's a wild uh a wide sale uh of uh remote controls in the world. And and the components are very uh very cheap. Um  Uh  diodes  uh bat batteries and uh uh LED lights  they're needed and they're uh everywhere available. Uh  again  it's a fair price. It's a common uh technology uh  like I told um Uh  the circuit board  it's the most um important uh um part of the remote control. Uh  we can use for that uh fibreglass with copper wires  it's it is uh can be made as fast as printing paper. It's uh it's all very uh Yeah  they're making it uh all the time. Uh  and it's not uh very specialised uh technology. I haven't come to here  but um I've got uh some uh images of uh remote controls. They were not uh very uh trendy or just uh just a remote control like everyone knows. So I don't know uh why I should put it here. Uh Yes  but uh I uh haven't made it because uh of the time. But What? No. Yes. Um  no  it's uh it's just a part of uh a known technology  yeah. Remote control is nothing special nowadays. Um I don't think so  because of the all the televisions uh there are a few maybe a couple of televisions with the new functions  but is it useful to put them on a on a standard uh remote? No. But you can put them under the same button. But you can put a play and stop and and rewind. Yes  but we Huh. Yes  but there are there are But how wi how will you be able to handle a whole market? There are uh a dozen of uh dozens of of remote controls that have Yes  but you could put on the z on the zap buttons you can put it to uh to uh access all the same pages. If you have seven pages  you can go up and down. Yes. Yes. Maybe we can make uh a kind of a joystick. But No  it's o just signals uh and the television d uh does the rest. No. The most standard batteries. But i in a way we have to be uh uh special. Maybe th m For the remote control. That's to be uh a formed for your hand. More like a joystick then. But that's that's fun for the first time  and then the second Or you can Yeah. With recharger. Yes  but is that handy? But but remote controls remote controls nowadays can can last uh two years  three years  with with t two batteries. And then you Yes. Or But you pay for it. Maybe like this pen. It has to feel nice in your hand. ,When this functional design meeting opens the project manager tells  the group about the project restrictions he received from management by email. The marketing expert is first to present  summarizing user requirements data from a questionaire given to 100 respondents. The marketing expert explains various user preferences and complaints about remotes as well as different interests among age groups. He prefers that they aim users from ages 16-45  improve the most-used functions  and make a placeholder for the remote. The industrial designer begins explaining the working design. He talks about existing products  most of which use infared since it is simple and cost-effective. He suggests adding a speech function  when someone asks where the remote is and it beeps. He also explains the various components  materials  and energy sources of a remote  giving preference to a remote with multifunctional buttons and without a receiver. The interface specialist presents  talking about the possible components of the remote and concluding that the remote should be simple and accessible without too much functionality. The group continues the meeting by having discussion about the possibility of a touch screen  LCD  and other functions. The group closes the meeting and goes to lunch. 
Hi. Oh yeah  we have to talk in English  huh. I'm afraid I'm a bit slow for this stuff uh. I'm afraid I'm a bit too slow. I don't know how much preparation you guys did  but not a lot. Mm-hmm. Not yet. Operations. Different pen widths  how do you do that? Oh okay. Are you serious? I in the file option menu. How much time do we have to draw anyway? 'Cause I can take forever on this. Is this part of our a acquai or introduction to each other? Alright. Uh. Your line broke. I'm guessing a turtle. No. I'm kidding. Because of its shell. Dude you're a good drawer. Do you have a turtle pet? Uh okay. Yeah yeah yeah. Stumpy stuff. They kind of l look like mole legs. With sharp nails on. A little tail maybe. Uh no. The little holes maybe. And why did you choose this animal? Alright. Alright. Colours were under format right? Let's see. How am I gonna do this? Um Mm uh. Not quite actually. No. Aye. It's a cat. Not quite yet through. Uh yeah I dunno. They're my favourite pets. Uh I have colour already. Yeah I'm not so good at drawing with this kind of st Oh shit. Um Excuse my language. I don't know how to draw its face. But you get the idea. It's a cat. It's my favourite uh pet animal  'cause they're cute  they're independent and cuddly  I dunno. That's it. Or do I need to use more colours and Alright. Yeah. So we have to s Yeah. Mm-hmm. I guess so. Yeah. True. Well I started making an overview for myself  um what I had to do  'cause we have three design steps and in every step I have a s specific task to perform or whatever. So I had to uh  I dunno  make an overview for myself about what I have to do  and kind of let it work in to get ideas about well how I have to fill it. Well I started I started with the first phase  I think was the functional. And uh let's see I had to focus on the working design  which you said. How does the apparatus work? And well I basically had two points. Uh according to the coffee uh machine example  I have batteries to supply energy  and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the T_V_. And that's basically all I have so far. Alright. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah I kept it global 'cause that it activates or deactivates specific functions  'cause I wasn't thinking yet about that. I mean  you wanna ch ch flip the channel but you might wanna use teletext also. I dunno what the word is in English. Uh Yeah. Obviously. Whoa. Is that you or alright. Alright. Alright. Well no I'm just a bit wondering what we're gonna do the next uh session? Yeah okay. We'll do our best. I am gonna work on the conceptual design already 'cause yeah it's fairly important to know what kind of components we want to put in. Do we I mean  is it gonna be a multimedia control centre? Do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it? Yeah. True. But but we need good communication about this stuff  'cause I have to f put the components into the design. So if I don't know what components to put in  it's kind of hard. Yeah so Okay. Yeah I I know what you mean  but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player. You need a play and a forw fast forward and a stop function. And you you don't need that for a T_V_. And and for a t uh teletext you need additional buttons as well  so I kind of need to know what we uh need. Whatever  I'll just put my ideas in uh in here and then we can discuss it with the next uh meeting. Okay. Okay. Alright. Yeah. I understand. Yeah. Alright. Yeah. Thanks. Alright. See you later. What the We're the first. Marketing Expert  yes. Yes. Bling bling. Yeah. Right. Uh where has my screen gone? Hmm. Yeah. My screen is gone. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Very nice. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Draw. Alright. 'Kay. Don't take up too much space. Should it be one Giraffe's yellow. Can you use one blank sheet per drawing? Or so y you must save it at the end and then Okay  then m make a new one. It's more like a dinosaur. Uh. Some leaf to eat. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. Uh Yeah. Alright. It's not that fast. Yeah. I see. It misses the spot. I say good guess. Uh Because it's slow. Yeah I was a bit slow too. So Uh some other line uh width uh No. I dunno. Does it have legs? Yeah? It's more like a tank. Yeah that's fins but I don't know where. Some spots. Ah some eye. Yeah that's a fr friendly turtle I guess. Yeah well I think it's uh fair enough. Right. I don't know what the position is. Does it have ears? No. Oh okay. Can you erase ears or Yeah? Alright. Eraser. So I dunno. I it just came into my mind. So there's no particular reason I pen. Yeah. Well I'm guess I'm done. That's my turtle. How to select the next or here. Yeah. Here you go. A fox yeah. Firefox. A cat who had an accident or Yeah. Okay. Great. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that's very common. Yeah. Yeah. Uh well from a marketing uh perspective  um well the function des design phase uh consists out of the user requirements. Um what needs and desires are to be fulfilled? So there are a few means to reach that um by by doing research uh to see what existing products are there out in the market. I mean  what functions do they have. Um especially what are their shortcomings? Are there any new functions uh which can be added to our product? Um therefore we have to to do some internet search. For example for um well what kind of applications do current remote controls support  and what are f featur features of uh current and future televisions? So we can see uh what needs to be supported. Um and we can interview current users and future users. What w what would they like to see uh on a new remote control? Um especially for future users  uh I'm thinking of early adopters  because they they use new technology first  and they play with a lot of tools and stuff so maybe they have some good ideas to uh to add. I think I can get that information  yeah. So yeah. No n not specifically. More to how to get them and Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. From the other end of the room or something? Yeah. Any more points to discuss? Alright. 'Kay. Thanks. Yeah. The pro okay. Yeah. Okay. Uh. I guess so. Yeah. We're just working the three phases. Okay. Better make it Yeah. That is my question also because like new new functions Requirements. Yeah. Yeah. Unit. Yeah. Yeah well I I was Yeah well like l li like some like some some remotes who are out there  which I know  there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices. So you can switch to your video and then the same buttons control your video. And another function I'll think of switch to your media centre  because that's getting very popular. And then use your Windows media centre under your T_V_ with the same remote control. So with the switch  one single switch S Yeah records and stuff like that. No. Yeah. Yeah. In the project uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Half an hour. You're fired. No. Alright let's move on. Yeah. Yeah see you later. Well good luck. Mm uh. Mm. We're the first ones. Move to the meeting room. Okay. Hello  good day. Yep. Kick-off meeting  wow. It's uh looks uh nice. Hmm? Yeah. No  it's it was uh not enough. I did my best. Okay. Um yeah. It's a giraffe. Yeah. Okay. Uh it needs some uh some yellow uh Oh format. That's some spots. No. Okay. Do I have to explain uh why I chose this uh this animal? I think it's a it's a great animal. It's a it's a giraffe. Yeah  that's a Um Okay I'll will give it an uh an eye. Hey. Come on. The next? Yes. Here you go. Hmm. 'Cause it's so 'cause it's green. No. A rabbit I think. Kangaroo. Fox. Mm. Okay. What uh what uh do you want to discuss? Yep. Yep. Yeah. Wireless uh huh. Uh it's uh some buttons for for the on off function. You d you already told that. And for the changing up to the to all the channels and changing the volume. That are the the basic options for a remote control. Okay  yeah. Yeah. Yep. I got some uh requirements it has uh it has to be user-friendly. Uh really easy to use buttons  not not uh very small buttons  but not the the also the big big buttons  but just normal buttons. It has to be a small unit. It has to be uh yeah  you can take it with you uh everywhere in in your house. So it has n has not to be l yeah  gigantic uh machine. Uh and a and a good uh zapping range. Uh the distance uh from your television to your uh remote control has to be  uh yeah um yeah  quite a big distance. It has to be capable for zapping uh Yeah. Okay. Are you going to put the the notes on the Okay. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Do we only have to to do uh phase one  the functional design uh? After that we are going to the conceptual uh Okay. I would first m Yeah. I I think we have first to start with the basic functions and we can uh expand them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah it it has yeah it has to be user-friendly. So it's hasn't it's yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Can we leave now or Mm. Okay. Good luck. Mm. So you found your spots. Okay. It's called black. Okay. You see this beautiful presentation. Okay let's get started. Uh I sort of prepared this. Uh opening acquaintance  tool training  uh how to use the things here. Uh project plan discussion  and yeah then the rest of the meeting. Um we're supposed to develop a new remote control  that's both original  trendy and user-friendly. So  hope you have good ideas. I don't. Um we're work we're working uh from top to bottom. Uh functional design  then we do some in individual work  then we have a meeting to discuss the results  etcetera etcetera. And at the end of the day we should have a prototype drawn up. Uh we have available the smart board and the whiteboard. Um uh we should take some practice. I have some instructions now to do that. Uh well you know how to the documents work. So Uh this for toolbar. You see it next. Um we have a pen. And we can use this pen to perform. Yes. So It doesn't always work. Yes. Okay so you can draw. Okay and in the format menu you can select colour and line width  etcetera etcetera. Okay? Uh Okay. Each of you can uh take some practice and you should draw an animal. Uh you should explain Uh with different colours and with different pen widths. And you should explain why you draw that particular animal. So  Julian. Uh with the format menu. And use different colours etcetera. And what's that supposed to be? Oh yeah. Oh yeah four legs. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah you can press the next button  which is uh yeah. I'll show you. Yeah. In file menu. Yeah. Yeah. What is it? A giraffe okay. Yeah I see a long neck but Okay. That's nice of you. Okay. Yeah pretty good. Uh could you press the next uh Okay. Then uh. Yeah sorry  introduction and get acquainted and That's the idea  so Yeah it's a bit slow  so Yeah. pressure. Why a turtle? It's slow. You were slow too so Yeah sure. Yeah not exactly legs but More like fins or Yeah. Yeah it's l looks very friendly. Yeah okay. No. Yeah yeah yeah. There's a a gum  gum to. He said it was slow. I like it. Okay. Your turn Niels. The next yeah. Makes new paper. Yeah. Orange. Kangaroo. Dog. Cat. It's a cat. Why a cat? You have some uh? The pen  yeah. Sure. Yeah. Alright. Okay. Yeah. I think it's okay. You get idea right? Okay um we have a financial aspect to this project. Um we can sell them at twenty five Euros. Uh the aim is to reach uh uh to sell as much as fifty million Euros. Uh that's quite a big amount of money. And the production cost should be the half of the selling price. Okay now it's time for some discussion. Uh Yeah. We should get started. Uh I'm taking notes. Um we each have a specific task  as I saw in my mail. I didn't know if you received the same mail. Yeah? Okay so the um uh this industrati Industrial Designer should produce a working design. Am I correct? Okay. Uh the User Interface Designer should specify the technical functions. Right? Yeah? And the Marketing uh Expert should come up with user requirements. Uh did any of you already do some work on this part or Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And do you have any ideas about the product uh so far? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah I got another point. It uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the T_V_ apparatus or stereo. Same I believe. Uh and what did the Marketing Expert do? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yep. Yes. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. And you can get that information? Okay. That would be very handy. Um but have you any idea so far as what uh the user requirements are? No? No okay. Yeah? Of course. Big  mm-hmm. Uh what do you mean by that? Okay um Well I don't think I have anything more to add at the moment. Um I think the best is to go to work. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I think we can go ahead with what we have. I will summarise the things we discussed and put it in the project folder. Uh the use of the Industrial Designer can work on the working design  etcetera etcetera. And it seems you get more information by email. So that was it for me. Uh Yeah  in the project folder. Yeah. I'm writing very fast. Hope it's readable. Okay um anything more you want to add to the discussion? Yeah. Because then we have a Yeah. Y you do some individual work  we have meeting  individual work  meeting. And at the end of the day we have a final meeting. And then I have to prepare uh I have to defend our design  so make it good. I depend on you. Yeah? If you can mix it it's okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Well I think that is the user requirements part. As to what they want. Uh do they want all those functions on that small Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah I understand. You can always add a few Yeah. Hmm  the C_D_ player. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. You need additional yeah. Yeah. Uh Yeah. Yeah. We could just start with the assumption that's only for T_V_ and video. And um reserve the possibility to add other features. So we have a basic starting point and you can always extend that so make sure it's extendible. Yeah. Th the least amount of functions possible so it's easier to get to know how it works etcetera. Yeah? Okay and uh I'll see you again uh when the computer tells us to. Yeah  you're di dismissed. Not yet. Okay. Let's see what we got to do. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. ,"The project manager opened the meeting and introduced the upcoming project to the team members. The team members then participated in an exercise in which each team member drew his favorite animal and discussed why he liked the particular animal. After the drawing exercise  the project manager discussed selling prices and production costs for the remote the team will design. The project manager also indicated that the remote will be sold internationally and that two million remotes are expected to be sold. The team then discussed their experiences using remotes in the past and what features to consider implementing in the remote they will produce. The team members discussed child proof capabilities  color options  how to adapt a remote for left-handed users  a ""go back"" function  the size of a remote  buttons  and LCD screens. The project manager closed the meeting and gave the team members their assignments and then one of the team members briefly went over his role on the team. "
