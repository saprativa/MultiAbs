"The visual represntation is hard to reproduce and understan at first sigbt Flow charts I 'm confused on why there are two paired programming problems when we do n't have class Thursday and then it follows spring break i needed more info on everything i screwed up on the exam If statements Nothing currently How to use if statements and while loops .",1
"The CATME team member effectiveness quiz . Not really applicable for this class session changing the time from clock to decimal for the PS 03 problem 1 I think that the conversion of clock time to decimal time could use more explaining . Liked the challenge though . Some of the questions on the quiz were pretty hard , and I do n't understand why the answer is what it is . ",0
"the mathematics of different data structures and other simple ops Runtime for Alist and Llist ' I am very excited to start looking at recursion again ! Going over the Assignment the idea of using linked lists The math involved in CS average time vs worst case time The big o concept , the beginning of recursion Runtime differences between AList and LList comparing alist and llist The song of the day Big O derivations The derivations for runtime equations were pretty neat !",0
"it was a smoooth class nothing nothing the change in the direction of inequalities confused me . the probabilities on both sides of the chi squared distribution equaling a/2 was a bit confusing F distribution projection The use of the F distribution ( why it is sigma-2-square * S-1-square / ( sigma-1-square * S-2-square ) and not sigma-2-square * S-2-square / ( sigma-1-square * S-1-square ) ) none for now determining the dofs of F Interval estimating",1
"UDFs I do n't know how to . All functions or how to make the variables all work . It 's kinda frustrating because we have the time to get the assignment done but I do n't know what to do and I feel like I 'm so close to getting it right . ",1
"The appropiate structure to use functions UDFs Switching the UDF file to Nino and io is confusing cause I do n't understand why we need to do that yet as well as it says to copy over the relevant information but since we are learning to use the user functions I do n't know what is relevant Histograms and matrix manipulation . some of the specifics involved with the function syntax Proceeding in problem 2 on PS04 Using some of the plot functions was tricky at times .

"The flowcharts , it is hard for me to follow the logic PS10 Problem 1 The templates are generic templates so there is a section that we did n't have to fill out but we were not told that until we asked about it The function itself is a little bit confusing since there 's multiple inputs and outputs When you ca n't use `` if '' instead of `` while '' or vice versa The exam grades in class and why things were graded the way they are . Flowcharts the problem set problem 1 While loops are complicated . ",0
