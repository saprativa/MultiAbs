Morning. Yep. My name's Frank. Thank you. Hmm  that's interesting. Sure. Yep. Visit it. Can't say I paid much attention to it  but Oh yeah. Okay. 'Kay. That was interesting. Innocent. 'Kay. I'm thinking about a swordfish.. Meat. Yeah. Hmm. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Gonna use a different line width. And I'm gonna draw in black. There. 'Kay  I'm not much of an artist  but here we go. Mm. Okay. This is my um Hmm. Sheep. With of course little blue dot they always get sprayed on their butts. There. Yeah. 'Kay. They are Come on. You have to go really slow when you're writing. They're brilliant animal animals. And that's just a little me thingy. So. Guess I'll pass the pen to our User Interface Designer. Interesting. A rabbit? Garfield. Yeah. Yeah. And the most interesting tail. Yeah. We're being haunted. Yeah  you got a message. So just on a side note  why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen? Yeah. Right. No. It's off now. Well  it was on  but Ah  there we are. Well  we have a kind of broad T_V_ at home  and a D_V_D_ player  so we got like a lot of remote controls  one for the T_V_  one for the video recorder  one for the D_V_D_ player. And I think it's it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all. Oh really. Yeah. Yeah. So I think you can take minutes again. Since it's your job. Yeah. Yeah. But that would be really good if we could do that. Um. Think it has to be shock proof 'cause my remote control tends to fall a lot. So Yeah  one other little thing. Thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it. So you can see how much is left in the battery. But they'll also really drag up the production costs  so think we'll have to see about that too. But maybe just a little LED  I don't know. Um. Nope  don't think so. Okay. Aye sir. Half an hour. Okay. Morning. Mm-hmm. Garfield. Well I was gonna draw a cat too  so. I'll just try something else. Something different than Garfield. Mine is a bit more skinny. But uh Well  it's supposed to be a cat. I like cats because uh they are uh independent. The pen. So. The pen. No  me neither. Nope. They were all mentioned  so Okay. Morning. I'm. Yep. Hmm? Okay. Yeah. Yep. Hmm. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Hmm. A sheep. Okay. Um I'm just gonna draw its uh head  but mm Let's see. Mm. Uh. Okay. Yeah. You know what that is? Or who? Ah okay  yeah. Just a Mm. Guess. So uh Yeah. That's enough. Um  you say a blank  or Okay. Five minutes  okay. Mm? Mm. Oh really? Huh. It's a Sure. Yeah. Okay  yeah. Yeah. Okay  yeah. Hmm. Oh. Mm-hmm. Oh. Mm. Mm-hmm. Sure  yeah. Waterproof  or uh Uh  you never no know uh  I w I mean uh 'Kay. Okay  yeah. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Okay. Yep. So uh good morning. I see you all find your places. Is everybody sitting on the right place? Yeah? I guess so. So Let's see. First I will introduce myself. I don't know if uh if everybody knows me  so I'm Bart  hello. Hello. Bart. Hello. Hello. Bart. Welcome. Uh let's see. Uh let's start off um with a little presentation. Uh Now first I'll tell you a little bit about the setting. You can see there are a few cameras here. They'll record uh our actions and you'll have wires and microphones that will record your voice. Uh there are also some microphones there but th um you don't have to pay a lot of attention on those  because it will uh disappear when you don't attend to it. So is there a project documents folder? There are some notes in it already I see  some documents. Uh I'll start with the presentation kick off. Is being modified by the administrator. Uh okay. Let's do it read only. Well I don't know if you've noticed  but uh we're working for Real Reaction. Uh it's a company in uh electronics. We put fashion in electronics  uh we make it work  uh we put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself. I'm Bart the project manager so I'll direct you through the project. This is our agenda. Uh we have our opening acquaintance  tool training  project plan description closing. Uh maybe I can sit down  then I can take some notes or Let's see. Maybe you can take the minutes once in a while. I dunno it's not a lot of work  but just uh if you hear something uh you can write down  just write it down. Uh as you can see uh it's the opening  aquaintance tool training. Aquaintance is a point we've done a bit. Um have you all seen the corporate website already? Yeah. Have you seen any flaws in it? I think I found one. No? I can see if it works this way. No  it doesn't work here. Okay no problem. But um on the corporate information side there's a th uh there was Real Remote instead of Real Reaction. Real Remote is not really the company we're we are  but it's just a little fault. Um okay  what are we going to do? Uh our project aim is as you can see a new remote control. It has to be original  trendy  and user friendly. So these are uh the points why uh we also hired you. We've got the Marketing Expert for uh the trendy and user friendly look. And Industrial Designer uh there's also user friendly and a bit original. And we've got our User Interface Designer. He's also uh That's about the new remote control. Uh project method um is uh there are three phases we are going through. First is functional des uh design  individual work  meetings. After the functional design  then the conceptual design and the detailed design. I had some role indications on here. But I think you know it already by yourself. The Industrial Designer is going to work on the working design  uh components design and a bit of the look and feel design. Uh the User Interface Designer is going to do the technical function design  user interface concept and user interface design. And the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification  trend watching and project uh product ev evaluation. So that's a bit what you're going to do. But that will be all worked out in uh other meetings. Then we've got our first tool training. We are going to work with a lot of high-tech tools here  so it's ab it's handy if we have a little bit of training first. As you can see we've got the smart boards here and here in the white board. Um in the white board here there's a little tool bar on this side. Here are some functions. You can save. N uh these functions we don't have anything to do with  only undo  you can undo a little uh piece of drawing. A blank new document for each person. Uh select a pen  eraser. Capture we don't have to do anything with. Uh then we've got our pen. This pen. It's really funny because you can draw with it on this page um in the think it is form of. You can also select the current colour and the line width. But then first you have to select the pen function. But we're going to work with it in a minute. So okay. Uh that's very simple and it's easy to uh draw your findings and drawings on there. Uh then a short thing about documents. We've got our shared folder  uh project project what was it? Project documents I think. But all you will found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already  so it will be okay. And these are available on the smart boards as well  so if you have a document you wanna show  just open it from the folder. Here is a simple tool bar. It's what I just said  it's save  print  move back or forward one page. You can switch between the different drawings. And then we're going to try out the white board. So as you can see we g all going to draw a animal. Just to uh uh just to get a bit familiar with it. Mouse wasn't running away. Is everybody is anybody playing with the mouse? No. Okay. We're going to uh draw animal. And uh just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics. Um the only thing we have to uh look after is that we use different colours  and different line width. Uh there's I can start from now. I will. You can use this pen by holding it like a like a little child. Because if you hold it like this  the sensors will get blocked and then the drawing won't get good. Another thing is you have to be uh a bit slow. 'Cause if you're going to draw like really fast then um the pen won't hold up. So we choose form of current colour uh I think grey is appropriate. Then the line width. I think seven will be nice. Now you'll see my drawing capabilities. These are not very much  but uh Uh  see you have to do it real slow. Oh Ah I was trying to draw a dolphin  but I think his nose has to be a little bit But it's close. So what yeah it's this is bit of the swordfish. Yeah  he hasn't got an eye. Woah. Now we've got another function. We've got the eraser. And then you can undo this easily. Ah it's okay. And I've got to write down a few of its characteristics. Uh is They've got no text tool  no. Uh. Okay. This is typically a undo action  I think. Pen. Maybe you have to hold it a bit upside-down. I think that's it because if you wan ar are going to do it like this then it will be a stripe. But I don't know  I'm just trying. This is not my work  okay. Maybe you have to use Oh. Uh. I think it's a it wants to draw a another animal? I don't know. It lives for the fun. So It's my characteristic uh characteristic about the dolphin. It lives for the fun. So now I'm gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you. Go ahead. Maybe it's easier to draw the smaller line width  I think. Because this is going a lot better than uh I did. It's nice. Uh. It's a real dead sheep  yeah. For recognition  yeah  I see. Um maybe you can also write your name somewhere. On just a Yeah. Nice. Sweet. Yeah  just a blank sheet. No. Yeah  it's pretty skinny cat. Is your cat  or did you find him on the street? Ah. Okay. That's pretty clear. So everybody knows how to work with the white board now? So if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the white board  just ask and go ahead. It's pretty uh easy. 'Kay. S haunted white board. So we've got the tool uh introduction. We move along to the project finance. Um as you can see  we um for our remote control  a selling price is uh twenty five Euros. Our selling price. Uh our profit aim is fifty million Euros. Uh that's the least we have to get from our remote controls  so we have to work together to reach our aims. Uh we can do it international  so we have to focus on different kind of users  different kind of cultures  and different kind of trends as well. Um but that's all in the later stadium. Our production cost um can be maximal twelve and a half Euros  so that's also a point we have to keep in mind  that we won't make remote controls with small televisions inside  and stuff like that. It won't work. So just try to remember these points. Selling price twenty five  profit aims fifty million um  but more important is the int international market we're trying to focus on. And production cost uh maximal twelve and a half Euros. So that's leads us to our little discussion. We've got about five or ten minutes left for discussion. So I'm gonna sit down  I think. It's easier. I've got a message. Five minutes. Okay  that's uh good timing. Uh maybe you have to say the magic word. Does it do anything? Maybe you have to just clap it down? Mm back up again. No slide show. Hmm. It's off. Now you have to put it back o Oh yeah. You'll be okay  I think. Well it's those laptops. Nice. Okay. But so mm does everybody has um experiences with uh remote controls  and I mean not the ordinary mote controls  but also a little bit different ones? Like you can use for other? No? You? Ah yeah. Yep. Yeah I've I've got one at home. And you can uh program I think eight different devices in it  and you can use it for your television  anything else. And it also operates on infra-red  so you have to got the little device inside your room  and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor. So that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or D_V_D_ player downstairs and you've got a link to your T_V_ on the second floor. So that's a pretty handy um thing. Um but only the I think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control  it makes it a lot easier as well. It's uh That's good to remember. Yeah  that's nice  I think. So we've we want different functions uh and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra-red. But I don't know if that will exceed the production costs. So that uh that's something we have to find out  I think. And other functions for a remote control? Maybe we can make it uh uh Shock proof. Sure. Waterproof. Okay. So these are our um a few things we can think of. Um I will put the minutes from this meeting uh in our project folder. That's a battery stays. Yeah. Uh. That's an idea as well. Other ideas? Quick ideas. Okay. Any questions about this uh presentation? Kick off presentation. No? Okay  then I'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder  and then we can all work. Finish meeting now. Okay. And we can all work uh on our own projects. Okay then I'll meet you in about a half an hour  I think. So good luck. ,The project manager opens the meeting and presents the agenda using slides. The marketing expert explains the research she read about  which is a study done on 100 people asking their remote usage habits and preferences. The Industrial Designer presents  explaining the basic function of a remote control and how it works. He says they should first agree on the technical functions before he creates working design and chooses the chips and infrared components to build it. The Interface Designer gives his presentation  talking about the remote's technical function of sending a message to the TV set that is decoded by the TV. Standard TV remotes have an on/off button  play  volume change  number keypad  and a 1 or 2 digit option. He suggests that in aiming for the next generation they should have a remote for the TV and video integrated together. The project manager recieves a message from account manager  which he shares with the group. They discuss and determine the target group as well as the possibility of making a universal remote for stereo  VCR  and TV. They close the meeting with the project manager telling each group member what they will do before the next meeting. 
Okay. Everybody ready? Welcome at the functional design meeting  again presented by Maarten. Uh this is the agenda  the opening. Uh  we've got three presentations. And I'm gonna show you some of the new projects requirements that were sent to me. And we're gonna make a decision on the remote control functions. We have uh forty minutes. Oh  well this is the the closing already. So uh well we start off with the th the first presentation then. Uh  I think um in uh we have to do it in uh in right order. Maybe the Well  it Oh that. It won't doesn't Maybe we should start with the the technical functions. Yeah? Well it's you dumped the file in the uh in the sh in the project document folder. You've already done that? Well let's close this one. We'll just uh open a new one. Uh  well. Yes. Uh-oh. New thing. Oh yeah  uh I have to say something. Uh  due to some uh technical problems I haven't uh digitized the last uh the meeting minutes. But I'll uh make sure that uh happens next time. And I'll get this one uh in digital uh form too. Okay. Okay. Okay. But it's the technical side of the remote control. Oh. Okay. Well  we'll we'll have to skip that part then. But you don't think it's a problem um to design uh the technical part of the remote control? It's gonna be easy? Okay. Yeah. M Okay. R regardless of what type of functions we want to implement. Doesn't really matter. Okay. Yeah  okay. Okay. Well  we'll see. We'll see later on. No. Well  uh will there be some uh user requirements later on? The ones I I've uh received from the account manager. Yeah. Well  we'll keep this in mind  and then discuss it later on. Uh-huh. Okay  but this real this uh big d uh distinction between this type of remote. we should we should choose one uh we should not compromise but uh really choose for uh expert viewer or novice v Yeah? Well  what that's what you want trying to say. Okay. Okay. Yeah  well some of these Uh  yeah. Well  some of that will Yeah  but i but it will be more clear when we come to the uh u uh some of the new requirements. So Mm-hmm. Okay. Well  then the Marketing expert can uh tell us something about the current market. Okay. Visually presents. Okay. Well  then we I'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements and then we gonna discuss on uh what features we find important. Uh  well some of the uh new requirements make some of your findings quite uh irrelevant  I think. Because um uh s decided to put They have decide to put two additional requirements forward. Well  now I see four. That's kinda strange. Well  they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet. Well  I think that may be so  but well  we can't just leave the teletext button off. It's impossible  I think. So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button  you know  like on and off  and don't make a lot of special put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or You know  it's just you want you want to be able to make use of teletext  but not to play with it that much. So we have to think of that. The remote control should only be used for television. Otherwise  the project becomes more complex  which endangers the time t t ma uh the time to market. So maybe we should leave all D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ related features off completely. I don't know. I think that uh that's what they're trying to say. Uh  our current customers are within the age group of forty plus. New products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty. So you uh talked about the elderly who were willing to spend more on a remote control and who were interested. But  well  they're not relevant because we are aiming at a younger Yeah  but it is it's is a dif it's a fact that the th th that bigger market you're talking about  we already cover that. Our company already sells remote control to the older people  but we we also want  you know  a new customer group. That's the one we haven't covered yet. So I think that's what the problem is. We haven't got remote controls for uh Well I think  yeah. Yeah  I think so. Maybe if it's no no  but I think we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants. So maybe we can make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group  but isn't that bad for an older person either. Uh  our corporate image sh should stay recognisable in our products. Our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design. Okay  something else nice to know. Sorry? Yeah  you will have to look that up. I think it's something about the Oh  okay. I thought it w might be  let's make things better or something  but Okay well  let's go back to the the agenda. So we've now had to the three presentations. We know about the new project requirements. That means we can uh well d yeah  discuss on the remote control functions. Well  if I can uh make a start  I think it's becoming more clear what kind of remote control it's gonna be  and I already talked about the maybe you have a f familiar with the rem remote control that has the the can opener underneath it. I think we're we're looking for some Yeah  we we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic T_V_ functions. Y well  that Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  yeah. M yeah  that's why um well a lot of um the use the requirements the the account manager sent me  I think they are are c are contradicting each other  because they want a simpler design  and no uh other uh s functions than just T_V_  but they s do aim at a younger Well  ma But I think uh you we can make some discuss uh distinctions in uh what kin in the  know  th th in functions you have Y Well you have different kind of uh equipment in your room  like a t T_V_ and a D_V_D_ player. You can uh  know  you you can make very d you can put very detailed functions regarding the T_V_ set on your remote control uh with the with uh the  you know  audio settings and uh v uh screen settings. We don't want that. I think that was that became clear. We don't want. But w maybe we should put some func uh  I know that the younger people will most likely have a D_V_D_ player they want to  you know  they want to uh control  remotely. No  yeah  th th the user requirements of the the The new project requirements told us not to But maybe w Yeah. I think we maybe should Yeah  well we should uh put some functions for other maybe for other equipment on it. But just the basic functions. Maybe like rewind and wind  or n what d what do you guys think? Yeah  if as far as possible. But what do you think? Do th should we implement features that uh uh or functions that to control other devices? No  you don't think so? Yeah  the new requirements say so. Well  maybe it's maybe there there there is something th m most of the time these functions don't support the particular device as well as their their own remote control. You know  a lot of D_V_D_ players have some tricky settings with Yep  exactly. That's that's wha No no  you don't No no  you don't need it. No  no. Okay  but we have to think uh w we have to think D_V_D_ I th uh  I guess  so um but uh from my experience it's kinda a lot of D_V_D_ players  you know  like forwarding  goes differently. Uh  you get two speed or eight speed or sixteen speed. It's c sometimes a bit difficult. Maybe if we just leave the D_V_D_ functional m uh Well  I was thinking about putting it in  but concerning the project requirements and what you just said  I think we m should focus on the T_V_ then. And uh and it's just an uh a complimentary remote and not a universal one. If you want to keep it simple  you can make a universal remote. Okay. It's just a s it it should be something that is like a gadget on your coffee table  and it's just for when you you you jump on the couch  you pick up the the the nice remote  the simple one  just to put on the television  nothing more. Okay. Um  but what televis Yeah  we we'll make w this one trendy. And simple. Well  we we will come to that  but ju first on the on the functions. So we should put uh zap buttons on it. Um  also numbers  to uh to go to the specific channels. Uh  Okay  a t a teletext button should be there. But just one big teletext button  on and off. Probably. Oh  okay. Yeah  but uh I think that becomes too difficult  it's not a very common function and people will have to read up on their remote then. Yeah  yeah  but maybe you s yeah yeah  maybe y you do  but I've never heard of it in the first place. And we have to well t yeah  and t and teletext is becoming outdated. We just want to see what programmes are on and what time it is probably. Yeah. I don't know. I think that that's kin getting too complex for our remote. I don't know what you th guys think. Yeah  but do you like to have a such a s stop button? Or do you think it uh I think it's a kind of uh uh very rare and special function. Yeah. Okay  it goes Yeah  but that's kind of stuff we should do on the internet right now. That's why it was uh said in the in the use in the r new requirements. Well yeah uh  lots of new televisions can store pages  you know  and then you can just skip manually through them using I think we should just put one teletext button on it. Then we meet uh the new requirements. we also meet the other thin y you sh you just re we have to choose for the the simple design  I guess. Okay. Um  well  what functions do we have to decide on? Or do we uh I dunno if we have t stif specifically name all the functions we n we want. We have the zap and uh the volume. Should we do m make them very big? The the the zap button. D d Th that's that's that's considered to be trendy also. Or maybe you should place them on a uh  in a special way? Yeah  something or uh somethin special way to to zap through the it has to s it has to be yeah  and quick. You have to use it very quickly. Yeah  and it the buttons should make it um possible to to zap through your channels in a rapid at a rapid pace. Oh  what should we decide on then? I think in a in a case of this simple remote control  the technical aspects which uh weren't worked out already  but it w shouldn't be a problem then. Yep. No  okay  but we don't have to uh  when we don't want to uh control other devices  I think it makes it even more simple. I think I think that we should use uh d yeah  not not uh the b the watch kind th the most uh Well  it has to be simple  and I wi Which are most likely to be found somewhere in the house  you know. Oh. How much time do we ha we have left uh? M m m more than thirty minutes? Uh ten twenty minutes. Well  uh these these shouldn't Yeah. Yeah  okay. But that's that's Do you uh have you have you think about tha thought about that? How we can what the extra touch can be. Do you suggest design or the shape or some gadget f f kind of feature or Well  it was something about how we lose them. Maybe it should be a remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. Nah  um a lot of people like to have such kind kind of kind of gay kind of things. It w it w should be like a birthday present or something that you give someone  and it is i has something nice. Or maybe it w should have a big uh light that can flash or something on it  or maybe it should or an or the like the the can opener. Maybe it contains some feature that you don't normally link to a remote control. I think it's very impor because we're gonna make such a basic remote control  we have to do something to make it special. It's gonna cost twenty five Euros. Yeah  but the well  it's already been done. Nah. Yeah  that's true. But and I think it's gonna be uh very uh it has to be sturdy or something  so maybe with with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something. it has to be used something special  and you really it has to  you know y not s people  when they buy it  they have to think  well this one lasts for a long time. We're really gonna use them. Not some thing you you throw away next week  you know. So maybe uh that's i I think that's when uh when we decide on these type of functions  know  basic functions  uh it's very important to find something like this. So there's a very important task for you. And maybe we can all think about it. Uh  also for you maybe  when t you it's very nice when you can be entra when you can be trendy  and and uh and al as in a friend use friendly as well  you know. So big buttons  flashy design  and maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing. Uh-huh. Yeah  or just different colours would be uh I don't know if people also wanna spend more money on fronts for their uh remote control. It could be be Yeah  you never know  but But it and I think we have to make it quite big. Yeah  people So  and and also because uh it is expensive. If you want it to be something  you know  it's ha doesn't have much functions want to be you don't want to get it l make it Mm-hmm. And shou and should ni look nice when you put it on a table. I I think you m might wanna put it uh yeah  that it it it it stands up. Yeah  you have to put it on its So it's like a vase or uh something you put on a table. no no  put stuff inside it. But  it's like like a statue or something Yeah yeah  but yeah  but you also can put it somewhere near the window in That it's it's fashionable. I I don't Oh  yeah. Yeah  but but when you when it gets lost  how can you press the button to make it Oh  okay. Uh  that's kind of nice. And then also you don't even need batteries  because you can make it uh chargeable. Yeah  that w yeah  but yeah  the pro No  well I think that it might be t p Well  nee but we don't Yeah. Maybe you  but we don't know much about production cost  but when you you can imagine that when you spend twenty five Euros on a remote control and it's a basic remote control  then the then the money there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know  rechargeable units. Yeah  but we would d ma we'd do it in Taiwan and So  it's not gonna be that expen Uh I I think it's a great idea. S some kind of be I've never seen that before  and you make it uh um be uh  you see it with uh the mo the mouses nowadays. Well  I well it's really ch you can recharge it  so you ha never have the battery problem. That's one. And uh you can always find your remote control up Uh  okay. Well  maybe yeah  you could when that's when it's too costly  you could probably skip the recharger  but you will you do need uh also an uh  also you would need a battery in the the base unit as well  you know. Does it makes it kinda Yeah  yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah  but then it's very easy to make it also a rechargeab I don't think that is gonna cost much to make it also a recharge function in it. Yeah. I think it's a good idea. And make it  you know  we we um Well  we uh it's it isn't a t a most uh costly uh remote control. We can save on the on the functions. We just put some simple button in  make it big and sturdy  nothing more  and just make s sure there's some noise that it can make  or probably some kind of cheap light thing around it or that it uh that it lights up  it's also nice. And if you put it away  I think it's uh w we have to we uh that's uh it's not a easy market. We have to something special. And for twenty five Euros people want something remote c special from your mote control  and we can't deliver that in r with uh regards to the functions  because we aren't gonna put Yeah. And then uh when make it  you know  nice looking shape and this and then you also you got the stand-up thing. Yeah. I think I think it's a good idea. Yeah. Oh  if it let's well  we will see what's possible concerning the the costs  and if it's possible we'll do that. And we even try to save up on other stuff to make sure we can do such a thing. And the first thing we the most likeable thing to to n to skip is then probably the recharge function or something. If that's too expensive  we won't do that. But it would be nice. It's the idea. I know that batteries last long nowadays. And and what people just think about  well  I'll never have to buy any r batteries again  so y b because it's very annoying when your battery is empty. And you know then when you haven't batteries around  and probably for two weeks  your remo I've experienced that that Yeah  okay. So  easy functions. Well  we will we will I think we'll work that out  zapping  numbers on it  bi Yeah. But it's also annoying. 'cause as long as it stays as it ke keeps working  you're not very motivated to do something about it. Then it beeps all the time and. You don't want to have ever have those problems  and you won't have if if you have the rechargeable. And you don't have to use the unit  you can also put it on the side if people don't like it. Uh  i i in the in the ma Yeah  but it w I mean  if if they pay for it because they think  oh  that's a great idea  I'm gonna use it. And when it  you know  when time goes by and they think  well  I'll never put him in the recharger  I think last long enough  then they put it on side and they can use it now and then. Then when they look get m I I I know for sure that everybody who buys this remote control  within a couple of months of they will be in the situation that they they're seeking for the remote control  they wanna see something quick and uh just push the button and th uh  I think it's brilliant. Yeah  I've never it's so simple  but I've never seen it. M maybe we should really do this. Okay now  well  how much time have we got left? These clocks aren't uh synched. Oh  now I've put uh well  it is twenty p Okay  so we have ten minutes or something? Yeah  but we're uh we're done. I think. We've decided on the functions. Well  there is some oh. There is a closing sheet. We have lunch break  and then we have thirty minutes of individual work. Oh okay  I'll make sure I'll I had some problems with uh the digitising the the first minutes  the the s the next minutes won't be a problem  but I'll try to make sure the first one will be in the folder too  but maybe it won't work  but you'll see. I think these are more important than the first ones  so. Oh  five minutes. Yeah  because uh I I d I did uh the first minutes I did were were were a bit scratchy  you know. Then I did a s second one with a nicer layout  which I could uh  know  use for the other ones well  but uh I d think uh I forgot to do put done under the first one  and when you go write a second uh it's get it's not working when you try to write second uh paper or something. And then you you had to overwrite it or someth I don't know. Becau I d uh  it was not my uh pen. this kind of looks you like. Of the shape. Yeah  probably  it would be nice. No  bigger. Well  I I I have to say  I have this uh can opening remote control in my head most of all  or I think some maybe we should no  that will be too costly. We shou we could also  that was a would also be an idea  but I don't think it I don't know if it exists already  you should like make Alessi or something design it. That would also be nice. But that's gonna then you c then you don't Yeah  but then you don't have t yeah it that's not something i that's in the production cost a one it's a one time  you know s was it's a single cost. Yeah  m but but then you can nah  I don't thin I think that it would be more expensive  because I've bought the Alessi stuff more often and even small pencil holders or something are more expensive. Would be a nice idea though. I don't know. I think it uh has to be a r it has to have round forms or something. Like something like that or so or so And on th and then uh s a base unit underneath it. It's also round. Put it in there uh wire on it. Maybe uh  I don't know  some some lights  a big but well. Volume and programme  yeah. And some of the extra funct Some of the extra functions over here. Numbers. And and lights? How we're g well  maybe uh s a ring of no  no  you have to Maybe on the side of it. Along the side uh strip of yeah. Yeah  but I also meant the the blinking li w you know  the ones that also blink when you try to uh uh locate your remote. Well  theys have to be Yeah. Yeah  yeah. Exactly. When you you see it from the side  then it would look just like that. And then you have a strip of uh lights or something. Well  uh I think it's nice  for one thing. maybe put something on top of it or  you know  like that's looks funny. I don't know. Or some bump. Maybe some Yeah? We'll have to think about it. I think we're we're done. We can save this one. Mm mm. Yeah  that was what uh Mm  we'll hear about it. Here we go again. Oh. Okay. Mm  okay. Yeah  it's okay. Okay. No. In project. No can that open. Open it there. Okay. About the get Okay. But nothing restricted for user interface? With technical I don't know. 'Kay. Okay. But I kind of uh Yes. Uh Well  the technical functions. Um  well I don't know if you got the same uh pictures as I got  but uh I got these two  and I think they're we have to focus uh on uh the uh one hand the expert view or the novice user. th I think it's it's very much uh depending on the user requirements  I don't s uh know who's doing t Yeah  but it I think that's very important to watch uh what kind of functions there we want to uh put in a remote control. Yeah  well y we can put functions in it when uh yeah  when we uh get the user requirements uh and we can update it. Well  yeah w if you want try a a a huge market  if you want to reach a huge market  uh like elderly people and we have to choose for novice user. But I don't know. It's it's really um depending on how how how far the the the remote controls are already in n um in use. Yeah  probably  yeah. Uh well  there are l at least uh basic functions  uh like just th the channels uh one till nine  uh on and off switch  which must be clear with a red button or something like that. Um  most standard uh have volume  of course  and a mute function  and  of course  the next and previous channel. I think that's just basic what we need. And from that on we can user requirements what we need more. Uh Yeah  I just um um I thought Joost was looking at the trendy the trends in the markets  and I don't know if there uh are any um uh if you put more functions  more buttons  maybe it's com becoming less trendy or something like that. M you can just you can k you can keep it in mind that. I don't know. Uh  I th I thought the the with less buttons you can make a more trendier uh yeah  more trendier design  I think. I think. Yeah? Uh  well  that's all I have to say  I think. Yeah  that was it.. Okay. Well No way. Yeah. But what's our slogan? The slogan uh Puts fashion in electronics. Sense simplicity. Yeah. Yeah  but wha But Yeah  but you sai you said that that a lot of functions aren't used. So why should j we put this function in? I think more I think uh people younger people are more looking for just a trendy look than uh more functions. Yeah  but uh you said Yeah  d yeah  but th the functions are not in the remote control we're making. It's n Yeah. Yeah. No. No  new requirements say no. So Yeah  but I i if it's too simple uh th they won't use the remote control  they use their own th th with lot more functions. No  no. Exactly. Mm  yeah. Yeah  but just keep it simple and look more at th No. It's only for television. So Yeah. Yeah  nothing more. Exactly. Yeah. The user interface is easy. And the basic yeah  basic functions  yeah. It's too much integrated in the other. Yeah. Will you look Look at the market. Well Yeah  I uh  it's Sunday I always use it for the uh yeah  for the soccer uh Well  uh when you uh uh when you look uh for example um  a couple of weeks ago I looked at the for the flights  and there are a lot of flights in one page  so if if th Yeah  but True. A simple yeah. But trendy  yeah. I don't know. Original. It was uh True. Yeah. Maybe uh Uh maybe we uh uh the batteries maybe. If you use large batteries or small batter batteries. Yeah? Yeah. Okay. Early break. To find him. That's maybe yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  but that's yeah. Yeah. Be original  yeah. Mm-hmm. And use friendly  yeah. Yeah. Must brain-storm. Well Why not? More money for us. Yeah. Quite big. Yeah  you think? A standard or something. It's like you have uh four phones. Something like that. On the television. Oh  like this. A char chargeable. Yeah. Why not. Production. It should be possible. I think it's a good idea. To make a base or something? It's it's it's it's it's not the purpose to be handy  it's Mm. Yeah  but that's not it's ugly  I think. No. Yeah. True. Yeah. Yeah  it must be must be a gadget to have. Yeah. Yeah  we c Or just give a beep when the battery's out or uh down. Yeah. true. Yeah. Yeah. And you can leave it just there. Yeah. Yes. Yeah  I'll Uh fifteen minutes. Can you make an uh uh a part of f folder for the minutes maybe? That not not everything in one one uh folder. Yeah. Maybe. Or the sh Do you get an idea of the shape? A little bit bigger  yeah but Oh  uh look uh look at the pictures. Yeah  flash lights at the side. At the side  or something like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  side of it. Just two LEDs or something on the side. Yeah. Yeah. Well  uh probably at the side. You know look at the front  but Yeah  exactly  and then there is yeah. Yeah  something like that  yeah. No. No. Bumper or something. Yeah. Lunch break. Okay then. Okay  five uh Oh.. Oh. Oh  I got a nice little screen here over here. I got like this big black border uh on every side. I'll I'll fix it. Yeah  whatever. Yes. I don't know what the right order is. So Mm-hmm. Yes  I agree. Yeah. Yes. Yes. I haven't really found a conclusion like that. Yeah. Design. Sounds interesting. Alright. Yes. Yeah. It's alright. Um Alright  I've done some research for functional requirements. Um yes. The working method um there were hundred uh uh w h one hundred people  uh how do you say uh  f watched using remote controls in the usability lab and they also uh filled out a questionnaire uh with a few questions. Uh  I've lined them up here. Uh  ask whether um common remote control looks good or not  about willingness to spend money on remote control  about zapping behaviour  and uh and stuff like that. I uh have found some interesting things. We do we do got a market. Um  three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly. So if we make a trendy design  we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market  which you can reach. Um  three out of four users uh zaps a lot  as I uh quoted here from the uh results. Zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour. That's quite a lot. Um  relevant options are  of course  power buttons. Although  only used once per hour. Uh  channel selection  volume and buttons for text  and the more um  yeah  other functions  like audio settings  video settings  sound settings are not said to be very important and uh very much used. Furthermore  fifty percent says uh they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control. That doesn't say we got we can leave ninety percent off. But it sure um says we shouldn't make it too uh complicated. Fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room. And um an important thing here  the most important customers uh  which is over seventy percent of our market  is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old. And uh elderly people  our market  are less interested in uh nice features  but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls. So  what I was thinking oh  wrong side. We shouldn't implement too much features on uh on our remote control  because elderly people will get th lost. Group features for a higher usability  uh what I was claiming in the previous meeting. Um  all the settings  about audio settings  video settings and channel settings  which are not very often used  we could group them uh on one button and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever  because they are used very rarely and well  it uh there are a lot of options there  so we can really make uh yeah  how do you say  we can spare at buttons over there. And um  if you want to implement V_C_R_ and D_V_D_ options  group them in the button  not too uh Yeah. Small buttons  so they won't be very um  how do you say Yes  won't be very present  thank you. And a trendy look  well uh  although seventy percent of the market is uh consists of elderly people uh who don't really care for trendy looks or whatever  I guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent. That was kind of what I found. Okay. Yes. Two? No uh  I agree  I agree. Not too much  no. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. I don't really agree actually  to be honest. It's a very small market which we will approach then if we uh want to reach customers younger than forty. It's only like thirty percent of the total market. Mayb yeah? Okay. Maybe maybe we can compromise a little bit. Not too much then  bu alright. Yes. Yeah  I'll have a look. We put the fashion in electronics. Sense and simplicity. Well  to be honest  if um our uh aim group is uh till forty  not older than forty  maybe that's not very uh yeah  we don't really need to have a simple remote control. I think we can implement more functions then  because um basically uh the younger people are more able to adapt to new technology and therefore will be a more Yes. Yeah. Well  I think Yes. Yeah  control. Not much more than that. Yep. Or we can u u we could put 'em behind the flip-flap or whatever. So t Yeah. Y yes. But but for for example  V_C_R_  that's better example in this case. I think on a remote control for television you don't need to be able to programme uh the V_C_R_ to start recording at three P_M_ or whatever  just play  stop  rewind and uh fast forward. Yeah  I know  but uh Yes. Yeah. Alright. Yes  definitely  yeah. Yeah  and maybe two or three other options  but not nothing more than that. I think stop function is very useful. If you have a uh a page which consists of more pages  and you are not a very quick reader  then I think it's very irritating if the next page shows up  but Well  I use it very regularly  the action. I re I use it quite often. Might be. Might be. I think the plus and the minus button should be uh quite present  yep. Yep. If you grab the remote  your hands should be on top of the plus. Yes. I think double A_. Yep. The most ordinary uh batteries. Yep. I think about twenty minutes. I think that's n that's more for a for an age range or uh ten to twelve or whatever. Yeah  yeah  that's good one  yep. Ye I think the can opener i is a brilliant idea actually  because television and beer is not a rare combination. Yes. Yep. No  that's true. Yeah. Yeah  a swapable front or whatever. Yeah. Yes  definitely  definitely. Yes  it it it should be f be visible nearly anywhere in the room. As I uh as I said during my presentation  fifty percent uh o Yeah. A face? Or uh yeah  yeah. Yeah. Yeah  yeah  I see what you mean  yep. If you do that  but I don't know if that's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half Euros. I in in the base we could like make uh a button  and if you push it  the remote control itself s makes noise. That's probably stupid  but uh as I found here uh  fifty percent  was it fifty? Uh fifty percent fifty percent often loses remote control. No uh  of the base the the the the the the the thing you put it in. If an a button in in that uh Yeah  you can ma make rechargeable one  yeah. Why not. It should only cost twelve and a half Euros  of course. Aye? Yeah  okay. Yeah. Yes. Yes  definitely. Yeah. Well y you you could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts  of course. I don't know. On the other hand  if you don't do it  we can also make a nice bay. I mean  it looks trendy and still still put a bleep function in it  but um I think the bay is definitely uh Sure  why not. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. With eye candy  ear candy  whatever. Yeah  definitely. Yeah. Definitely  yeah. It would be nice  yes. Most televisions break down before the battery pack is empty  so yes. Yeah  why not. Hmm. No  that's true. Why not. Bleep bleep bleep  oh there it is  yeah. Yeah. No. Nearly. Yeah. Something like that  yeah. Oh. We'll see. Maarten  five minutes. No  that's true uh  yeah. Should we by the way draw um on our nice whiteboard  um a little uh idea of yeah. I dunno. Has anyone got um a little bit detailed ideas about the shape? I don't  for one. A bit bigger I guess  but The shape is nice  it's um something different  and we want we want that. Yeah. Okay  yeah. Yeah  but twelve and a half Euros? Uh Yeah. Yeah  that's true. Something like that is very ergonomic. So Yeah. Yes  volume and programme should be there I guess  because you hands wi uh y your hands will be in the smaller part. Yeah  and the numbers on top  I guess. Maybe ro roun rounds uh uh l sorry. Maybe lights also around the volume and the p the plus minus programme buttons. Oh. Okay. Yeah. Okay  yeah. I think I think that'll be too big tha too big then. Yeah. Yes  we are. Alright. Yes  I guess it's lunch time. I don't know. Half and hour? I thought our next uh next individual round was half an hour. I don't know about the lunch break. Well My mouse is not working anymore. He's uh when I put it in  is is going to beep beep beep. Huh. Okay  how can I get this on the whiteboard? Okay  I've done that. Yes. 'Kay  we're going to um uh talk about working design. Um  the method of the remote control is uh electrical energy  it activates a chip uh in the remote. It's an electrical circuit which compose uh messages in the form of uh uh infrared signals to control the television. Mm  it's a nowadays very uh known  a known uh uh technology. Um  the known technology can make a cost very low. Uh  it's a wild uh a wide sale uh of uh remote controls in the world. And and the components are very uh very cheap. Um  Uh  diodes  uh bat batteries and uh uh LED lights  they're needed and they're uh everywhere available. Uh  again  it's a fair price. It's a common uh technology uh  like I told um Uh  the circuit board  it's the most um important uh um part of the remote control. Uh  we can use for that uh fibreglass with copper wires  it's it is uh can be made as fast as printing paper. It's uh it's all very uh Yeah  they're making it uh all the time. Uh  and it's not uh very specialised uh technology. I haven't come to here  but um I've got uh some uh images of uh remote controls. They were not uh very uh trendy or just uh just a remote control like everyone knows. So I don't know uh why I should put it here. Uh Yes  but uh I uh haven't made it because uh of the time. But What? No. Yes. Um  no  it's uh it's just a part of uh a known technology  yeah. Remote control is nothing special nowadays. Um I don't think so  because of the all the televisions uh there are a few maybe a couple of televisions with the new functions  but is it useful to put them on a on a standard uh remote? No. But you can put them under the same button. But you can put a play and stop and and rewind. Yes  but we Huh. Yes  but there are there are But how wi how will you be able to handle a whole market? There are uh a dozen of uh dozens of of remote controls that have Yes  but you could put on the z on the zap buttons you can put it to uh to uh access all the same pages. If you have seven pages  you can go up and down. Yes. Yes. Maybe we can make uh a kind of a joystick. But No  it's o just signals uh and the television d uh does the rest. No. The most standard batteries. But i in a way we have to be uh uh special. Maybe th m For the remote control. That's to be uh a formed for your hand. More like a joystick then. But that's that's fun for the first time  and then the second Or you can Yeah. With recharger. Yes  but is that handy? But but remote controls remote controls nowadays can can last uh two years  three years  with with t two batteries. And then you Yes. Or But you pay for it. Maybe like this pen. It has to feel nice in your hand. ,When this functional design meeting opens the project manager tells  the group about the project restrictions he received from management by email. The marketing expert is first to present  summarizing user requirements data from a questionaire given to 100 respondents. The marketing expert explains various user preferences and complaints about remotes as well as different interests among age groups. He prefers that they aim users from ages 16-45  improve the most-used functions  and make a placeholder for the remote. The industrial designer begins explaining the working design. He talks about existing products  most of which use infared since it is simple and cost-effective. He suggests adding a speech function  when someone asks where the remote is and it beeps. He also explains the various components  materials  and energy sources of a remote  giving preference to a remote with multifunctional buttons and without a receiver. The interface specialist presents  talking about the possible components of the remote and concluding that the remote should be simple and accessible without too much functionality. The group continues the meeting by having discussion about the possibility of a touch screen  LCD  and other functions. The group closes the meeting and goes to lunch. 
Hi. Oh yeah  we have to talk in English  huh. I'm afraid I'm a bit slow for this stuff uh. I'm afraid I'm a bit too slow. I don't know how much preparation you guys did  but not a lot. Mm-hmm. Not yet. Operations. Different pen widths  how do you do that? Oh okay. Are you serious? I in the file option menu. How much time do we have to draw anyway? 'Cause I can take forever on this. Is this part of our a acquai or introduction to each other? Alright. Uh. Your line broke. I'm guessing a turtle. No. I'm kidding. Because of its shell. Dude you're a good drawer. Do you have a turtle pet? Uh okay. Yeah yeah yeah. Stumpy stuff. They kind of l look like mole legs. With sharp nails on. A little tail maybe. Uh no. The little holes maybe. And why did you choose this animal? Alright. Alright. Colours were under format right? Let's see. How am I gonna do this? Um Mm uh. Not quite actually. No. Aye. It's a cat. Not quite yet through. Uh yeah I dunno. They're my favourite pets. Uh I have colour already. Yeah I'm not so good at drawing with this kind of st Oh shit. Um Excuse my language. I don't know how to draw its face. But you get the idea. It's a cat. It's my favourite uh pet animal  'cause they're cute  they're independent and cuddly  I dunno. That's it. Or do I need to use more colours and Alright. Yeah. So we have to s Yeah. Mm-hmm. I guess so. Yeah. True. Well I started making an overview for myself  um what I had to do  'cause we have three design steps and in every step I have a s specific task to perform or whatever. So I had to uh  I dunno  make an overview for myself about what I have to do  and kind of let it work in to get ideas about well how I have to fill it. Well I started I started with the first phase  I think was the functional. And uh let's see I had to focus on the working design  which you said. How does the apparatus work? And well I basically had two points. Uh according to the coffee uh machine example  I have batteries to supply energy  and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the T_V_. And that's basically all I have so far. Alright. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah I kept it global 'cause that it activates or deactivates specific functions  'cause I wasn't thinking yet about that. I mean  you wanna ch ch flip the channel but you might wanna use teletext also. I dunno what the word is in English. Uh Yeah. Obviously. Whoa. Is that you or alright. Alright. Alright. Well no I'm just a bit wondering what we're gonna do the next uh session? Yeah okay. We'll do our best. I am gonna work on the conceptual design already 'cause yeah it's fairly important to know what kind of components we want to put in. Do we I mean  is it gonna be a multimedia control centre? Do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it? Yeah. True. But but we need good communication about this stuff  'cause I have to f put the components into the design. So if I don't know what components to put in  it's kind of hard. Yeah so Okay. Yeah I I know what you mean  but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player. You need a play and a forw fast forward and a stop function. And you you don't need that for a T_V_. And and for a t uh teletext you need additional buttons as well  so I kind of need to know what we uh need. Whatever  I'll just put my ideas in uh in here and then we can discuss it with the next uh meeting. Okay. Okay. Alright. Yeah. I understand. Yeah. Alright. Yeah. Thanks. Alright. See you later. What the We're the first. Marketing Expert  yes. Yes. Bling bling. Yeah. Right. Uh where has my screen gone? Hmm. Yeah. My screen is gone. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Very nice. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Draw. Alright. 'Kay. Don't take up too much space. Should it be one Giraffe's yellow. Can you use one blank sheet per drawing? Or so y you must save it at the end and then Okay  then m make a new one. It's more like a dinosaur. Uh. Some leaf to eat. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. Uh Yeah. Alright. It's not that fast. Yeah. I see. It misses the spot. I say good guess. Uh Because it's slow. Yeah I was a bit slow too. So Uh some other line uh width uh No. I dunno. Does it have legs? Yeah? It's more like a tank. Yeah that's fins but I don't know where. Some spots. Ah some eye. Yeah that's a fr friendly turtle I guess. Yeah well I think it's uh fair enough. Right. I don't know what the position is. Does it have ears? No. Oh okay. Can you erase ears or Yeah? Alright. Eraser. So I dunno. I it just came into my mind. So there's no particular reason I pen. Yeah. Well I'm guess I'm done. That's my turtle. How to select the next or here. Yeah. Here you go. A fox yeah. Firefox. A cat who had an accident or Yeah. Okay. Great. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that's very common. Yeah. Yeah. Uh well from a marketing uh perspective  um well the function des design phase uh consists out of the user requirements. Um what needs and desires are to be fulfilled? So there are a few means to reach that um by by doing research uh to see what existing products are there out in the market. I mean  what functions do they have. Um especially what are their shortcomings? Are there any new functions uh which can be added to our product? Um therefore we have to to do some internet search. For example for um well what kind of applications do current remote controls support  and what are f featur features of uh current and future televisions? So we can see uh what needs to be supported. Um and we can interview current users and future users. What w what would they like to see uh on a new remote control? Um especially for future users  uh I'm thinking of early adopters  because they they use new technology first  and they play with a lot of tools and stuff so maybe they have some good ideas to uh to add. I think I can get that information  yeah. So yeah. No n not specifically. More to how to get them and Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. From the other end of the room or something? Yeah. Any more points to discuss? Alright. 'Kay. Thanks. Yeah. The pro okay. Yeah. Okay. Uh. I guess so. Yeah. We're just working the three phases. Okay. Better make it Yeah. That is my question also because like new new functions Requirements. Yeah. Yeah. Unit. Yeah. Yeah well I I was Yeah well like l li like some like some some remotes who are out there  which I know  there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices. So you can switch to your video and then the same buttons control your video. And another function I'll think of switch to your media centre  because that's getting very popular. And then use your Windows media centre under your T_V_ with the same remote control. So with the switch  one single switch S Yeah records and stuff like that. No. Yeah. Yeah. In the project uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Half an hour. You're fired. No. Alright let's move on. Yeah. Yeah see you later. Well good luck. Mm uh. Mm. We're the first ones. Move to the meeting room. Okay. Hello  good day. Yep. Kick-off meeting  wow. It's uh looks uh nice. Hmm? Yeah. No  it's it was uh not enough. I did my best. Okay. Um yeah. It's a giraffe. Yeah. Okay. Uh it needs some uh some yellow uh Oh format. That's some spots. No. Okay. Do I have to explain uh why I chose this uh this animal? I think it's a it's a great animal. It's a it's a giraffe. Yeah  that's a Um Okay I'll will give it an uh an eye. Hey. Come on. The next? Yes. Here you go. Hmm. 'Cause it's so 'cause it's green. No. A rabbit I think. Kangaroo. Fox. Mm. Okay. What uh what uh do you want to discuss? Yep. Yep. Yeah. Wireless uh huh. Uh it's uh some buttons for for the on off function. You d you already told that. And for the changing up to the to all the channels and changing the volume. That are the the basic options for a remote control. Okay  yeah. Yeah. Yep. I got some uh requirements it has uh it has to be user-friendly. Uh really easy to use buttons  not not uh very small buttons  but not the the also the big big buttons  but just normal buttons. It has to be a small unit. It has to be uh yeah  you can take it with you uh everywhere in in your house. So it has n has not to be l yeah  gigantic uh machine. Uh and a and a good uh zapping range. Uh the distance uh from your television to your uh remote control has to be  uh yeah um yeah  quite a big distance. It has to be capable for zapping uh Yeah. Okay. Are you going to put the the notes on the Okay. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Do we only have to to do uh phase one  the functional design uh? After that we are going to the conceptual uh Okay. I would first m Yeah. I I think we have first to start with the basic functions and we can uh expand them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah it it has yeah it has to be user-friendly. So it's hasn't it's yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Can we leave now or Mm. Okay. Good luck. Mm. So you found your spots. Okay. It's called black. Okay. You see this beautiful presentation. Okay let's get started. Uh I sort of prepared this. Uh opening acquaintance  tool training  uh how to use the things here. Uh project plan discussion  and yeah then the rest of the meeting. Um we're supposed to develop a new remote control  that's both original  trendy and user-friendly. So  hope you have good ideas. I don't. Um we're work we're working uh from top to bottom. Uh functional design  then we do some in individual work  then we have a meeting to discuss the results  etcetera etcetera. And at the end of the day we should have a prototype drawn up. Uh we have available the smart board and the whiteboard. Um uh we should take some practice. I have some instructions now to do that. Uh well you know how to the documents work. So Uh this for toolbar. You see it next. Um we have a pen. And we can use this pen to perform. Yes. So It doesn't always work. Yes. Okay so you can draw. Okay and in the format menu you can select colour and line width  etcetera etcetera. Okay? Uh Okay. Each of you can uh take some practice and you should draw an animal. Uh you should explain Uh with different colours and with different pen widths. And you should explain why you draw that particular animal. So  Julian. Uh with the format menu. And use different colours etcetera. And what's that supposed to be? Oh yeah. Oh yeah four legs. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah you can press the next button  which is uh yeah. I'll show you. Yeah. In file menu. Yeah. Yeah. What is it? A giraffe okay. Yeah I see a long neck but Okay. That's nice of you. Okay. Yeah pretty good. Uh could you press the next uh Okay. Then uh. Yeah sorry  introduction and get acquainted and That's the idea  so Yeah it's a bit slow  so Yeah. pressure. Why a turtle? It's slow. You were slow too so Yeah sure. Yeah not exactly legs but More like fins or Yeah. Yeah it's l looks very friendly. Yeah okay. No. Yeah yeah yeah. There's a a gum  gum to. He said it was slow. I like it. Okay. Your turn Niels. The next yeah. Makes new paper. Yeah. Orange. Kangaroo. Dog. Cat. It's a cat. Why a cat? You have some uh? The pen  yeah. Sure. Yeah. Alright. Okay. Yeah. I think it's okay. You get idea right? Okay um we have a financial aspect to this project. Um we can sell them at twenty five Euros. Uh the aim is to reach uh uh to sell as much as fifty million Euros. Uh that's quite a big amount of money. And the production cost should be the half of the selling price. Okay now it's time for some discussion. Uh Yeah. We should get started. Uh I'm taking notes. Um we each have a specific task  as I saw in my mail. I didn't know if you received the same mail. Yeah? Okay so the um uh this industrati Industrial Designer should produce a working design. Am I correct? Okay. Uh the User Interface Designer should specify the technical functions. Right? Yeah? And the Marketing uh Expert should come up with user requirements. Uh did any of you already do some work on this part or Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And do you have any ideas about the product uh so far? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah I got another point. It uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the T_V_ apparatus or stereo. Same I believe. Uh and what did the Marketing Expert do? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yep. Yes. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. And you can get that information? Okay. That would be very handy. Um but have you any idea so far as what uh the user requirements are? No? No okay. Yeah? Of course. Big  mm-hmm. Uh what do you mean by that? Okay um Well I don't think I have anything more to add at the moment. Um I think the best is to go to work. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I think we can go ahead with what we have. I will summarise the things we discussed and put it in the project folder. Uh the use of the Industrial Designer can work on the working design  etcetera etcetera. And it seems you get more information by email. So that was it for me. Uh Yeah  in the project folder. Yeah. I'm writing very fast. Hope it's readable. Okay um anything more you want to add to the discussion? Yeah. Because then we have a Yeah. Y you do some individual work  we have meeting  individual work  meeting. And at the end of the day we have a final meeting. And then I have to prepare uh I have to defend our design  so make it good. I depend on you. Yeah? If you can mix it it's okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Well I think that is the user requirements part. As to what they want. Uh do they want all those functions on that small Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah I understand. You can always add a few Yeah. Hmm  the C_D_ player. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. You need additional yeah. Yeah. Uh Yeah. Yeah. We could just start with the assumption that's only for T_V_ and video. And um reserve the possibility to add other features. So we have a basic starting point and you can always extend that so make sure it's extendible. Yeah. Th the least amount of functions possible so it's easier to get to know how it works etcetera. Yeah? Okay and uh I'll see you again uh when the computer tells us to. Yeah  you're di dismissed. Not yet. Okay. Let's see what we got to do. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. ,"The project manager opened the meeting and introduced the upcoming project to the team members. The team members then participated in an exercise in which each team member drew his favorite animal and discussed why he liked the particular animal. After the drawing exercise  the project manager discussed selling prices and production costs for the remote the team will design. The project manager also indicated that the remote will be sold internationally and that two million remotes are expected to be sold. The team then discussed their experiences using remotes in the past and what features to consider implementing in the remote they will produce. The team members discussed child proof capabilities  color options  how to adapt a remote for left-handed users  a ""go back"" function  the size of a remote  buttons  and LCD screens. The project manager closed the meeting and gave the team members their assignments and then one of the team members briefly went over his role on the team. "
Okay. About the components design. Um for the energy source we can use a basic battery or  a as an optional thing  a kinetic energy  like in a watch  which you just shake and it produces energy. But if we choose for that option  the docking station would c become obsolete. So I don't think it's really an option. Uh for the casing  uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing  single or double curved casing. It's really up the the design that we're gonna use. It's uh doesn't uh imply any technical restrictions. Uh as a case supplement  we could um  I thought of that l later  uh a rubber uh belt  like a anti-slip. Uh for the b buttons  we can use plastic or rubber. And the chip-set  um it says simple here  but it should be advanced  because we're using an L_C_D_ uh screen. And as uh the trend-watcher presentation showed  um people like wood  but it raises the price and it doesn't really fit the image  unless we would start two product lines. Form should follow function overall. Um well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy. But depends on what we want. I think we should disc discuss that. Um for the case  uh the supplement and the buttons  it really depends on the designer. And the chip-set uh really should be advanced because otherwise uh it would really be a simple uh remote control. And that's it. Yes w there there are four options. We could use the basic normal battery. Uh a hand dynamo. But I don't think that's really an option. You don't wanna swing before you can watch television. Uh solar cells. But not every room is very light so it's not a very good option. Or the kinetic energy. Well y you basically shake your remote  and then it powers up. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. Oh. Mm I don't have any information on pricing. So I'll have to ask the manufacturing department. But that would also go for the L_C_D_ screen then I guess. It's a bit higher percentage  but Okay. And that's the best choice. Well there isn't any choice there because we're using the the the the display. So it's gotta be advanced. Mm I dunno. I'll have to uh research. Yes. Yes. Well the the general like most older remotes are flat  just straight. And uh our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases. Um it would just only affect the form  for as far as I know. So it's j really just up to the design department what we're gonna use. It doesn't really matter for the price or the functionality. Pick one you like  yes. Yeah. I think we should start by by choosing a case. Because that's the basis you're building on. So I could draw them out. Let's look at the flat case. Oh. It's from the side so it's rather normal. The the single curved so I'm not really sure what they're gonna look like  but I think it's something like this. So this type should be better for you or better Should prevent repetitive strain injury a bit. And the double curved s looks something like this I guess. So th those are the three options we have. Yeah. It's more logical to have it on top as well because  like on your mobile phone  it's always above. Oh maybe you should just s start on a blank page. Okay. Okay. Good afternoon. Sure. I'll start off then. Doh. 'Kay I'm uh gonna inform you about the trend-watching I've done over the past few days. Um we've done some market research. We distributed some more enquetes  questionnaires. And um besides that um I deployed some trend-watchers to Milan and Paris to well get all of the newest trends. And I've consulted some additional trend-watch trend-watchers  after the original trend-watchers return  about what the the best design would be. Um okay these are some overall findings. Um most important thing is the fancy design. Um the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor. Um innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design. By innovativeness this means um functions which are not featured in other remote controls. Um about half of  half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use. Um for our um group  we're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old  this is um  these factors are slightly more equal. 'Kay these are some more group specific findings. Uh the older people prefer dark colours. Uh they like recognisable shapes  and familiar material. And our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much the material for older people. Um this is  this image will give you a little bit of an impression about um the look-and-feel that um the remote should have. Um this leads us to some personal preferences. Uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the in the room. Um so this would mean no uh eye-catching designs. Just keep it simple and Well the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest  because this would be the These would uh be the innovativeness in the remote control. So this would be very important that we at least include these features. Um well the trend-watchers I consulted advised that it b should be  the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped. So you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station. This is not really This is pretty much a new shape to uh older people. So they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station. So it would be kinda more telephone-shaped. Um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions  one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel  and one with a grey-black colour. The wood-like for the more uh exclusive people. People with more money. Uh the grey-black colour for well people with less means. That would be all. Any questions? And how exactly does the kinetic energy work? You just You use it and it works. Okay. Well personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it. And besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete. And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can um get great popularity for our product. Um wel Yeah you could load up the batteries  you could um insert the find the lost remote control function in there. That's true. I'm wondering um what will the voice recognition mean for the production price? 'Cause in our earlier um market research  if you'd allow me to go to the flat board  SMARTboard. Um so it was open here. Um we also um asked if w they would  if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control. Well you can see here  our target group would not do that. So if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control I would greatly advise not to do it. I think that would be better to uh insert in our other product  that is meant for the younger people. Um well this is Yeah but this is here the question was  would you prefer it. So that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it. And on top of that the L_C_D_ screen would um help in making the remote control easier to use. And I think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use. Um well this was for like an L_C_D_ screen like you would have on a on the the most advanced mobile phones. So pretty large. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well And I think most important factor there is the wooden colour. So it wouldn't actually have to be wood  if it's just wood-coloured. Probably. Yeah that is true. Yeah. We would have to look carefully into the design though. 'Cause we would have to make one w uh control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a plastic cover. The more original one  or the more standard one. So that would Well I wouldn't design a telephone but Well no I think w we should just  we should then just design one um one remote  but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one. So  but that shouldn't be too much of a problem. Um I heard our Industrial Designer talk about uh flat  single and double curved. Could you explain that a little more? Mm-hmm. And what would single curved and double curved mean? Okay. So we can pretty much just do whatever we want. 'Kay. That's good. No just to lie down. We'll go for that. Well or besides it. Mm-hmm. Um you uh said you wanted to put the um changing channels button on the right side  so you could  so your thumb would be easily Well uh I think that was a very good point 'cause I pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes cause R_S_I_. So that would be great for that. Um I thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side. For left-handed users also. For the volume. Um well that could Yeah we could do that but I'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy  ease of use. But if we would make um a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides  that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote. 'Cause it could be made all symmetrical and stuff. That is true. Yeah. Yeah. That is true. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. And I'd prefer the corners to be round. Think that would be better. Friendly on the eye. Yeah. Yeah. Very good. No. Mm no. Um 'kay um yeah. uh some uh research uh a about um designing of an interface. Um the uh last meeting uh we had a about um uh using a f few buttons. So uh um uh that's w what I what I want to uh uh to do in uh our design. So um finding an attractive uh way to control uh the remote control. Um the uh I found some uh something about uh speech uh recognition. So maybe uh we can uh use uh that. Um Uh and uh using a little uh display. So um findings. Um yeah just um we have just to focus on the primary um functions. So uh only uh buttons uh for uh sound  um for uh on-off  um uh shifting u up uh sa uh ca channel or uh down shifting down. Um uh let's see. Um yeah and Uh we uh need some uh new a attractive functions uh uh which attract uh uh people for using it. So uh it's uh like a speak uh speech uh recognition and um a special button for selecting uh subtitles. Just uh what we uh mentioned uh last uh meeting. Um and yeah overall um user-friendly. So uh using uh large large buttons. Um It's uh possible to uh uh to make um quite cheap uh system for uh speech uh recognition. Um you can think about um uh when you lost your um remote control  you can uh call it and um it gives an um sig signal. So uh uh yeah. And and uh for uh shifting up a sen uh c ch channel or uh for um uh putting out uh sound or something  you can uh just give a sign uh say um sound off or A and uh yeah. Television uh put the sound off uh put the sound off uh. Um Let's see. Uh yeah. I was thinking about the special uh button for uh subtitles  um just one button to keep it uh simple. Uh one push on the button uh you get uh uh small uh subtitles. Um double push push um  if double click  um so uh you get uh big uh subtitles  for uh people uh um uh which c f uh who can't uh read small uh subtitles. So uh Um Yeah and w we have to keep uh in general buttons uh so um we've got um the buttons we have to use. The on-off  sound on-off  sound higher or lower  um the numbers  uh zero to uh uh nine. Um the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down uh channel. Um also we want to uh use a little d display uh for um for displaying the uh the functions of the buttons. And um we can uh build in a function f which uh shows the channel or some uh which the t television is on. So um made a little uh picture of uh it. Um See. Um yeah. Just um we can put uh the on-off button uh over in this uh corner  um almost uh e all uh remote controls uh are using a on-off button on that place. Um so uh people uh will uh recognise uh um the button. So um D display uh of it  it's uh just a small display. Uh um you can put it uh on top. Um it's uh most uh uh place where people uh  most of looks at. So uh um and a special uh button for shifting up uh and uh shifting down uh channel  um it's uh on place where um the thumb of of the So you you can uh easily uh shift up or shift down. Um it's uh quite uh handy place. So um and uh all the f functions for subtitle uh one button  uh for sound uh Uh and uh for our design  um uh we have to discuss about it uh I think uh so uh the form of it so And that's it. Mm. Nah. But what's the function? Yeah f for loading up uh the batteries. B b Okay but uh it won't use uh much e energy uh I I believe. Uh it's uh just a small display so I believe uh it will run on one battery for um six months or f or or more. So I believe one battery uh is just enough. Uh so Okay. Yeah. That's true. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Uh. Mm. Mm. 'Kay. Yeah. But uh is uh our uh research um about um bi large uh L_C_D_ sh uh display  or uh just a small one uh we want to uh use? Okay. Yeah. No. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Uh I dunno. Mm. Mm. Uh is it possible uh to make um changeable uh case. So um uh you 'cause uh Yeah with uh mobile phones uh uh so uh like the Nokia mobile phones  uh when you can change the case of it. So maybe it's possible uh possibility. So um um you have just to make one um standard um remote control  and um yeah you can sell uh few uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. okay. Mm. Uh we can just use the regular form of it  but it's um not quite uh fancy. So um Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. For uh Uh for Yeah yeah. Mm. Yeah we um Is it possible to um program it s so uh you got on the left side uh or on the right side uh buttons for for shifting u up and shifting up? And on the uh other uh uh o other side uh buttons for uh shifting  uh for for the sound? Or Or isn't it? Yeah okay. Uh. Mm. Yeah but Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. See um yeah. Or we have to make a left uh For lefties and Um You mean um Yeah if Mm no. Yeah. Um Yeah. It's just uh u using uh your thumb. So um it's Yeah. Yeah. Um Yeah yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. So um Do you say this um S uh Uh you got like uh sort of a I believe There? So um you want to put a display over here? Or not? Yeah. Um Yeah. Uh we can make it um Mm? That's the top. So uh this top. This down. Um maybe it's possible to uh make this side like um Let's see. Um Colour uh okay. Uh to make this side um like mm the right colour. Um bit like so uh um in the form of your hand. So um Uh it's an So so the remote control have to um lay in your hand. So uh it's possib um yeah for s so and And to put uh the the buttons for um changing uh the channel uh over here uh Yeah. Uh rem Yeah but this place um Uh it's Yeah I dunno um Yeah. Yeah so So Five minutes. Yeah. Yeah. But um the on-off button  um still on the top uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 'Kay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Uh good afternoon. This is our third meeting already. I hope you enjoyed your lunch. I did anyway. Um let's see. Presentation three. Okay this is um the second phase uh we're going to discuss today. It's the conceptual design meeting. And a few points of interest in this meeting um are the conceptual specification of components. Uh conceptual specification of design. And also trend-watching. Um these are hopefully the points you addressed in uh your pre uh presentations you're going to show me in a few minutes. Um but first I'll show you the agenda. Uh first the opening. Then we have three presentations. Uh after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts. How we're going to make it. And then we're closing. We have about forty minutes. Uh so I suggest let's get started. Uh did someone encounter any problems during the preparation? No? Everything fine? That's nice. Then a little uh thing about the last meeting. Uh these are the points um we agreed on. The requirements and the target market. Uh requirements are uh teletext  docking station  audio signal  small screen  with some extras that uh button information. And we are going to use default materials. Um does somebody have any comments on these requirements? Maybe? No? These are just the the things we thought of  so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else  just let me know. And maybe we can uh work it out. And we're going to target uh sixty to to eighty year old customers. So now everybody knows what we're do we're doing  um I suggest let's get started with the presentations. So shall we keep the same uh line-up as uh last time? Okay. Good luck. Okay. Thank you. Any questions about the the trends? Mayb No? Okay  we go on to the next one. Okay. Uh thank you. Okay. Thank you. So that brings us to the discussion about our concepts. Mm. 'Kay. So these are the points we have to discuss. Um first I think we can talk about the energy source  since that's um has a pretty big influence on production price  uh and image. Uh so uh f I think first of all we have to see uh it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget  I think. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. No. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Uh Uh well I think uh elderly people just like to have everything in place. And I don't think they they like uh remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms. So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place. And also what you said. Um you can introduce voice recognition by uh finding back your remote. But I think it's um more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station. So you have a but button on your docking station which you can push  and then it starts beeping. And then we can we can still use the voice recognition  but maybe then for only the the channels. That's safe. Yeah. That's a good point. Yeah  sure. Go ahead. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Easier to use? No  I think that's a good point. Yeah. I personally think the L_C_D_ screen we wanna use  with the extra information  I think nobody has anything against it. Because it's just uh some extra information  and it's easy to ignore as well. So if you don't wanna use it you just don't use it. And um yeah I think the um Maybe we have to uh discard the voice recognition. Because it will increase cost uh signifi uh significantly. And I don't think the I don't think it will be a lot easier to use  as well. So that brings us back to the energy. If we don't have the voice recognition  it will it won't use a lot of energy to use. Um So in that case we could use kinetic uh energy  but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good. And much cheaper as well. So Okay let me just choose for the battery. That brings us to the chip. Just the advanced. Okay  advanced chip. And then we get to the point of the case. Um which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well. Uh if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey. Or both? Um as we saw there is not Yeah wood is a lot more expensive to produce. Um but I think it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive  which they can show off to their grandkids. Look I've got a new remote control  and uh Yeah. That's right. But with colour was a lot more expensive? Or? You don't know? I think so because Yeah. It's a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape. Yeah. Change the cases. Yeah. You can sell the cases. Yeah. I think that's a very good option. Because um then you can advertise as well with the Give your grandfather a new case for his remote control  or whatever. Because that's a it's something extra  it's something other remotes don't have  which we can get a great advantage point. So and then you can make them with colour. Black and grey  other colours as well. Costs. Yeah. Yeah. So you suggest we should design two different telephones on which you can apply  yeah remote controls  on which you can apply different case covers  for example. Remote. Yeah. Okay. So everybody's okay with the changing covers? I think that's a good uh good option. Changing case covers. Yeah. Mm. Okay. Uh but the form has to be um It has to It's has to be possible to stand up? Or just only to lie down? And the the cover of the the docking station is also on top of the television then? Or not? And you can just yeah then click it in. That's okay. Um so the interface. What type of interface do we want to use? Um maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the on the the board. Does somebody have ideas for a form or Yep. Mm. Usabili Yeah ease of use will be a lot more difficult  and then it's But you have extra buttons. So people can get confused. Especially if they have the same writings on it. Can't we make uh Can't we make a remote which you can flip over and use on the same functions as the normal one? Then you have to Let's see if I ca A blank one. And then you get Here's a little L_C_D_ screen. Uh now I have to think. It's a plus and a min. No it's not very handy I think. Because the plus and the min will be opposite and all kinds of No that's not gonna work. I guess. Maybe we should Yeah. But is it a problem that left-handed persons use a different hand? I think the functions are that basic that nobody should have any problems with uh choosing a channel or Y yeah. Yeah. I think we could just uh leave it a normal shape. Uh but maybe we have to make it a l a bit more fancy. In one or ano another way. Yeah. Um yeah just Yeah. Easier? 'Kay. I suggest um the single curved  because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the the screen in. Uh so that elderly people can uh use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen  because it's a bit  it has a bit of a angle. Yeah. I think so. Yeah. But now it's Do you have it upside down or Do you have it this that's top? Okay. Yeah. So get your mouse. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good one. But I think it's better to put the screen uh on top. So just flip it a hundred and eighty degrees around then you get here. If you can have this one  you turn it like this. And then flip it upside down. Because uh maybe your hand is in the way  if you have the display here. I think i On top. Yeah.. So then we get Here's That's the curve. Here the display  and then buttons. Yeah and then we can have a little bit off here and here maybe. Just that's for left hand and right hand users. And then h the rest of the buttons over here. Yeah still here jus That's Yeah. Should be more bit more friendly  yeah. 'Kay. Supplements. That's okay. Where's my mouse? Then We've got a general idea of the concepts and the materials we're going to use. So now for the next meeting uh we'll have to look at the look-and-feel design. It's important that the corporate design image uh is going to be in the remote. So check out the corporate website maybe. The user interface design  it's the same story. And product evaluation. So the Industrial Designer and User Interface Designer are going to work together on this one. But you're going to get your instructions I think sended by the coach. So just um I will put these um minutes on the in the folder. And then we're going to uh try to finish our project  and uh make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers  I think. Which are Uh let's see. I'm not sure if you're going to start right away to work together or I think you're going to fill in the questionnaires first. And then you'll get a message. So that's uh basically it. Maybe this one? Then we can save this one in the folders group. Uh yes  it's here. SMARTboard  there it it. So if you wanna have a look at it  it's over there in the projects folder. And then I guess we'll start in thirty minutes again. Thank you. ,The User Interface Designer presented three different concepts to consider for the user interface and introduced the idea of using speech recognition in the design of the remote. The team discussed the issue of using speech recognition at length. The Industrial Designer presented possible materials to use in making the case for the remote  introduced the option of using a solar battery  and discussed options for buttons. The Marketing Specialist  discussed recent findings from trend watching reports. The team discussed what materials to use and their interface concept. 
Okay. Uh first of all I'll start with the costs  because that's going to influence our design. If you Don't know if you al already had a look or not? Because we have a problem. If you look closely  you can see. Um I already took the liberty to make some suggestions... At the moment we have fifteen buttons  one L_C_D_ screen  one advanced chip-on-print. We use a uh sensor  that's for the speech. Uh we use kinetic energy. And we wanted uh the buttons in a special colour. Okay. What's the first thing we should drop? The special colour of the buttons? Okay. Uh Should we switch to a hand dynamo? Uh that's the still the same idea as the kinetic energy because you have to use it and do things. Batteries? Batteries.. Yeah. So You're going to redesign something. Okay  so we're at twenty five. Um Do we keep the shape doubly curved or g do we go for single curved? Mm-hmm. Uh Yeah. Um Uh another option I saw was to drop the buttons one through nine  so you can't directly access a channel  but instead use only the up and down arrows. That would skip nine buttons and four and a half Euros. Yeah? Uh then we have left Uh yeah. We do. They don't need special colours. Fine. That's more like it. You were saying something. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah  some more menu options. Yeah. Okay so maybe we can drop few more buttons. But um Now let's look. Mm-hmm. Uh Yeah  scroll-wheel  push-button uh Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Uh yeah. Yeah. It's uh One integrated button is five times the cost of a normal button. So You could also drop j three more of these  without losing much functionality. You just drop the Okay and the Back. Oh  that's for the speech. Yeah. S s Drop speech recognition? Yeah that's possible. Buttons. That's not very easy to use. Yep. Okay. Because if you d lose the L_C_D_ screen  we need a lot of Yeah. We need a lot of extra buttons. Okay so we drop the speech. And drop it yeah? Okay. S Fo Four less Euros. So we still have three and a half Euro to lose. Yeah if you lose the the Back  the Okay button Uh v let's say we only have the four arrows  and the Menu button. Then you're Oh and the power button we have also. Yeah. So that's one Euro. Yeah. Yeah? And That would save zero point two Euros compared to No. Yeah. To This together is more expensive than Oof  it's almost the same as t keeping this. And we can drop these two. Volume. And the power button. That's the basic. Yep. Okay th that's Yeah that's one Euro more expensive. That's not an option. Menu  power. Four arrows? Power. Uh Yeah. Okay. So four arrows? Uh power I believe? Uh We have a Back and a Okay button. And the Menu. Yeah  and even if we drop three buttons from here  we still have to make some adjustments around here. So The L_C_D_? Yeah. Then I rather make it wood. Because then also it's good in the market with the forty five plus uh people. No that maybe not. But maybe it's better than plastic anyway. Yeah? Yeah okay uh Yep. Yeah  yeah. Yeah  okay. Plastic. Uh that's easy because plastic is free. Yeah  okay. Uh if we dropped uh Yeah? You still need that. S No  I keep the re Yeah. Yeah. Because we already designed for it. So Yeah and something else. No y you would rec Then you have Then you still need two additional buttons I believe. For the volume. You can use those Yeah. Oh yeah and power. That's three buttons and this would cost Yeah. Three. Up  down  Okay. Yeah  okay. It would save enough Yeah you can choose this  drop these  then we have a half Euro left. So we can maybe still use power button. Yeah. Yeah. You see? Oh still Yeah? Oh then I miscalculated. Oh yeah. Shit. Drop the special colour. 'Kay. What else? Uncurved? Yeah. They made it very easy for us. Ah  I don't think I can s uh persuade the management to say  this is better for the market so you sell more than Buttons. That's Oh yeah since we only have one button. I just m I don't I think Uh yeah it's I think it's grey  regular. Grey and rubber. Of plastic. Yeah. Yeah. No I don't think the current status of uh chips are pretty uh energy conserving  no. Yeah hand dynamo? Do you want an extra button? Yep? Instead of an additional power button? Yeah? It's for scroll Without Yeah but it's just a scroll-wheel which you can push down. So Yeah? So Woah we're within budget. It's a miracle. Yeah? Okay. Um  well. 'Kay  this was old. Yeah back to work. Uh Did I save it? Yeah. I I wanted to go  but I wasn't allowed. So Uh I just forgot to save this. Just a minute.. Yeah  this the last phase of course  so Hmm. Oh. Okay. Um Well we first should have had a uh prototype presentation. But well as you saw that hadn't made no sense  because we had to drop it. Uh Yeah. Yeah it was more important  so I just pushed up the agenda. Uh  evaluation criteria. You have t produced something about that? Uh you put it in the. Yeah. F_ five. Alt up Freaky. Yeah. Uh  of course we dropped a little bit of those uh Mm-hmm. Two. Uh y we should fill this in now. Yeah okay. Uh Yeah in the new design I s would say it's three. But now  in original design I say two. Okay then I say three. Hey  you're marketing  eh. Hmm. M maybe underline. Red. Oh yeah very true. He types everything. Everything. You don't use anything else. Yeah. Yeah okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Nope. Uh check with the Excel sheet. Yeah integrate it. Yeah. Just go scrolling and it will activate. It shows the most used functions and they are relevant  but You say you double click on the No  not anymore. Because he's now have a scroll-wheel that you can push in. Like on the the mouse. Yeah. To get into menu. Yeah. Or hold it ten seconds. No no no. Uh it should be trendy. Yeah. Four. Yeah  im in the menu. Five. It's the weirdest remote control I've ever seen. So Well it's different. Yeah. Yeah  it's still Yeah  I say two. Oh  that's the next. Two. Yeah definitely. You still have rubber d Or no. Yeah. Yeah. The one button we have. Yeah you could check with the Excel sheet. Yeah. Yeah or three. We have something. New. Yeah. You like both. Um oh yeah. I just couldn't Um  just one minute.. So. No not anymore. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah well yeah. No Yeah okay. So Ooh. And Yeah? What? Yeah. Yeah. That Count them. Add them? Or Could somebody start calculator? Mm-hmm. Yeah  yeah. You have to 'Kay. So four and Nice work. O one. Plus five. Bo Uh two. Four. Start over? You can Oh yeah. Okay. Three  four  nine. Uh Eleven  fifteen. Seventeen. S Uh That was the last one. That was that. Yeah. So divided by nine. So Yeah. Divided by nine. So thr t two. So we're better than average. No. Things  yeah. Okay. It's still yeah. Has some shortcomings. Okay so Um this we had  this we had. We have to do a product evaluation. Uh prototype presentation we dropped. So Uh the finance we looked. We have redesigned. Uh not on that  but So you can just make one big L_C_D_ screen. Yeah uh The the button has a special colour  the frame has a special colour. It's plastic. And single curved. Oh and you might want to add a uh infrared LED. Otherwise it uh doesn't function uh so well. Well I have to um um make an uh report of every decision we made so far. And I try to get chip just before uh I uh receive the Excel sheet. So I Yeah I'm I'm somewhere  but maybe you can help me. Uh I was here. So Ah That's enough to get started with  so Uh  I just took one for every step and then a conclusion. Yeah. Well I think I have to make a p an issue called finance. Yeah. Mm-hmm. .... I don't think so  if you see the options. But Yeah. You can't even draw anymore. Even children can draw. Can you just push pen and then keep on Hmm. Yeah. Yeah just on the the m um the L_C_D_ display. This is your Real Remote. Yeah. Yeah. You can just reuse that  because the name is the same. Initials. Mm. Luckily. Yeah  it's uh Yeah. Okay. And copy this. Just a minute. It's It's somewhere I d It isn't inside. Yeah  and don't know how it's or eject it. From up there? No. Yeah it's somewhere in here. Save copy. Yeah.. Yes.. Well Um now you probably have to recalibrate. Oh  five minutes to the end of the meeting. And the recalibration is done using this icon here. Yeah well I just Okay. You go ahead. Yeah. Yeah. Then I have to uh uh write this  and I don't know if you have to present  because I didn't receive any information about that so far. Maybe we get a a final mail. Yeah. Yeah  I have still ten minutes to finish the report. Yeah. And you can uh just uh relax and uh have cup of coffee or oh no  they don't have beer here so you can't celebrate. You can just if you ma finish my presentation please. Uh over there. The presentation is still open. So if you finish that then you'll see uh Yeah next. Oh yeah  we have to do the project uh evaluation. Just uh do that quickly. Uh Uh well basically what that says  we discuss it and um So how were did the project process uh go? Did you  were you all pleased with the process as it was? Or are there uh Yeah the interaction and the steps we followed  and and so forth. Yeah. Mm-hmm.. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay and was that due to my leadership? Yeah? That okay? Okay. Um was there uh enough room for creativity? So and the uh about the board digital pen? Uh was that helpful or Ooh. Yeah it works. Mm-hmm. Use the pen. Yeah yeah. Blink. Oh. Okay  are are there any new ideas about this? All I think I didn't really receive  yeah. Uh uh w uh S sorry uh Mm-hmm. Yeah. Oh. Uh we should uh enter our questionnaire. Ah. Woah. Okay. Uh okay. That's the management. Hope so. Um Oh no. No n I I already did it. It's not much. It's just one question. Yeah. No that's that's for the trendy uh feel and look. So Yeah  b but I think the battery option. Oh. Oh no. Yeah. But we don't have any basic options any more. Yeah we c could We only need the the the the the menu arrow arrow button uh thing. Everything you can do with with the menu. So With the display. Yeah. So you do one inte You can do one integrated scroll-wheel push-button. And then just drop all the other buttons. But but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push-buttons. Yeah. So we have to to make it s uh more uh It has to be Could drop the speech recognition. We we d Yeah. Yeah. We lose our whole concept. Uh so No we just We keep the L_C_D_. Yeah. If we do uh two integrated scroll-wheel push-buttons  we can drop all the the push-buttons. With with one uh integrated button we can uh do the whole menu thing. With the other  we can do the the channel  the volume  et cetera. No it's three Euros. No? Um No it's it's n Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah. It's the Let's make the Let's make the case plastic. Yeah. But Plastic with a with a special colour. A woo wood uh wood uh wood colour. That's an option. Yeah. So we do one one s Yeah. Hmm. No the buttons  those are really needed. Yeah th th it's it's uh An advanced chip-on-print. Oh that But the But the integrated uh button? How many func functions can it uh have? Okay. Oh no. No no  it has to be um curved. Okay. Okay. Wh what we could do is um drop the the special colour  and uh do the special colour for the buttons. Yeah. Just something else than than black or white I think. Yeah. The display The But if you have to power the for ten minutes  then the Yeah. No no it has to be curved. Yeah. Just put a special special colour of the buttons  or something. Yeah or spe special form? Yeah. Yeah. But it's it's for the integrated button  I think also. Or Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yep. Oh just oh ma make it two special colours  but we only have one button. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yep. Two or three. Two or three. Yeah. Yeah. Or give it a colour. Yeah true one. Yeah. It hides uh basic functions. Yeah true. I think we are It's in Oh yeah it was integrateds. Yeah. Can you uh change channels directly with with just one button? No  you have to scroll through the menu  before Yeah. So it's it's not No. Yeah. Oh no. Seven. Yeah. Five. Five. Yep. Yeah. I think a two. No. Yep. No you got a plastic. Yeah. Yeah. You only have one Yeah. Four. Yeah. Red. Mm yeah yeah. It's the white part uh Yeah. We have a we have a Mm-hmm. Ah i And that you only have to control one button. It gives visual feedback. So I think a five. Five. Okay. Yeah. Yeah that looks uh great. Yeah. Nah Yep. Yeah. S Yep. Wow. No we put the electronics into the fashion. Yeah  four is okay. Okay. Three plus? Plus one. Plus five? Oh. Wait a second. Oh. It's it's gone wrong. Okay. It's your turn. No it's if you press twice on the plus button  then you get s s No. That's why it's uh Just count it to Yeah. Sixteen. Twenty two. Twenty four. Twenty six. Oh  sorry.. Oh my. Okay. Twenty eight. Hmm. Some questions are Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh great. Okay it's your turn now. Yeah. Yeah we we can just uh use this one. And then uh over-paint it with uh uh the green uh he only needs one button. Yeah. Or we have to delete this one or Oh oh no. Okay. So that's Okay  but how do we make the the scroll uh button? It's just one yeah. Uh that's the infrared uh thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um  uh it's just a scroll Yeah  is it's horizontal or vertical? I think Yeah. Yeah  yeah. Yes. It doesn't look like uh Uh it it's it's not Yeah. It's not very fashionable anymore. But uh it's okay. Yeah. Maybe m make it bigger? Or Yeah. That looks little bit more uh Maybe that's a s a special colour for it. So we can make it uh special? Or or speckles in it? I dunno. Uh I'm not sure. Yeah red is already a special colour  I think. So It's not very special  but uh Yeah. Just uh put the purple uh purple on it. That's trendy. Woah. Oh yeah. Hmm. Oh what?? Oh no. No no. Yeah. Oh it's it's just one computer? Or No. But can we delete it  just with delete? Or Crashed. Oh  no. Okay. Yeah  over here. Hmm? What's this? Oh yeah. Oh that's the select button. It's uh No  it looks It's okay. Specially the the R_. D designed by Okay. No. Do they have a lo Oh  the here. This i this is the logo. Two R_s and a one. Yeah. Okay. Are we uh ready? Uh Or Is this uh the last assignment? Or Final Um bug. Bug. No it's in inside the No it Oh. Hey  you've got it uh read only. So you have to uh. It's too uh It is It's now single curved. So It's flat. Oh no. Okay. It doesn't matter. It's it's That's the detector uh for the Okay. Yeah. I don't know. Maybe that's why it's it's not working  because it's more Yeah. Oh. Oh yeah. Yeah. You've to make it s uh ninety degrees. You have Oh we're always long. Yeah  can we t can we get to that i Oh it's not working anymore. Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah  it's it's working  it's working. Yeah. We're improving uh Yeah. Yeah. No it So cake. No. No. Yeah. Yeah. Especially after the first meeting. And Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah but only the the financial parts uh Yeah. Yeah. Finish meeting. I think the PowerPoint is is too limited. You can't uh draw easy in in PowerPoint. It has to be uh yeah. The drawing board has to be integrated into PowerPoint  so that you can just easily Yeah. Yeah just for text  for text it's uh it's okay. But 'Kay. Okay. Oh. Okay. . Oh . No. Oh. No. Yeah but young people like that. So just do normal battery. Yeah. It has to be twelve and a half. Or not? Uh  yeah. But we can keep it single curved with uh top view still curved  but from the side it's it's flat  and the screen screen is just Well you just have to hold it like this then. So Alright. Let's do it then. Yeah. we F_ eight. Yeah. The joystick. Integrated scroll-wheel push-button  yeah. Yeah or or the integrated scroll-wheel push-button. So that's kind of on your mouse and then you can click it  adjust it  click again and then you're out of it. But you still But you then still need to have Well you can use the scroll-wheel as well for um maybe for the channels. But you still um You still have to have some some button in the menu to go back. Yeah. Well not all. Not s not sound I guess. Mm. Yeah. Wh wh what what what is the what is the uh sample sensor sample speaker? Speech recognition. Right. Buttons. No  it can be disturbed by by noise and stuff like that. Let let let me see what's more what's more popular. I guess the the screen was more popular than um than the speech recognition. I have to look on that. Let me see. Uh well no I was wrong. There are more people who like speech recognition than an L_C_D_ screen. But if it But it it it's a it's a both a hypers No  but Well we Yeah we keep the screen. I mean it's it's about the same. Eight one to ninety one percent  uh sixty six to seventy six. Yeah. Let's drop the speech. Sixteen Euros. But y y Yeah. Yeah. And then and then use um The the Okay. And the menu button does also does the okay function then. And then when you in the menu S so so you activate the menu. Yeah yeah. Yeah.. Well okay. For example if you have f f four buttons  channel up and down  uh volume left right Okay  I've I think we have to keep that. And then and the power button. So that's five. That's basic. That that's what you need anyway. And then for the menu  um you can have a button that activates menu. Or d or do we just integrate an an an scroll-wheel with a push-button. And then if the moment you use the scroll-wheel  the the the menu gets activated  and then you can scroll  choose an option  click on it  it goes into an feature. Click on it again  selects features  scroll  adjust it. Click again  it's okay. Then you only need one button to move back. Or or under each option  you set a you set an a screen thing what says back  and you select that one  click again  and you go one step back. And in that menu  scroll  click  one step back. So that then you need five buttons  and one integrated scroll-wheel push-button. But we can't drop three buttons. But I see that's Yeah. So that's not a good idea. Because which buttons do we have now? Those five which I mentioned  and then menu  and then Yeah. F of the four things? Yeah  th power. Which more? Yeah. Power. Th Yeah that's five. Yeah  okay that's seven  and one to activate the menu  yeah. So okay that's eight. Well we can't reduce that. We we keep the display. Oh  well okay. Yeah. Yeah well we need the advanced Instead of r Yeah but but that's not our market. Ah no  hard plastic. Yeah  plastic with special colour. No but I I Because we have to use the special colour anyway. You forgot that. So let's go for the plastic. And since it's not kinetic  it doesn't have to flip around that much? We still have problem of two Euros. Yeah we can't drop them. Do we really need that advanced chip for an L_C_D_ display? Oh. I rather keep I rather keep the display. So the only option is an hand dynamo. Oh no tha Oh that's one Euro  right. And then integrated s Yeah but that would make it not so easy to use. I mean it's not that important  easy to use  but Yeah. You you press it for like three seconds. Then then then you should do everything in the menu. On the screen. Yeah. Yeah  but we'd Alright. It s it saves us four Euros and it costs us two and a half. So let's see  we we drop the price by one and a half. But we still have thirteen left. Thirteen. So still half. There goes the special co Well That would make it less appealing. So that's no option. We sure about the advanced chip we need for the display? Well yeah. yeah. We made it hard for ourselves with the display  but it's a cool feature. Yeah but I mean what is meant by special colour? S yeah. Alright. Yeah. So I rather have an hand dynamo than than drop the colour. You can still play with it then I guess. I don't know. Yeah  but a hand dynamo costs a lot of energy to keep the screen working. So I guess that isn't an option. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah true. Let's let's go for the hand dynamo then. Or or do we Or do we do uncurved and flat? Instead of Yeah it has to be curved and has to have that colour. And a screen. Yeah. S what what is special f Oh yeah  special form. Maybe that's nicer. But we don't have any buttons. So do d Uh make it a special colour then. Yeah ma make it a special colour then. Okay. Make it a special colour and then it look fancy. So Yeah. Let's let's save it. Yeah. Let's do it like this  I mean  because it does not lose our identity of the product as we Yeah all your designs are uh pretty much Yeah but that but that's the fun part of it. Alright. Yeah what's the next uh phase? Uh the agenda. By your humble P_M_. Oh f Frustrated. Alright. Yeah. Drop  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah that that's Yeah. I uh I sure did. And it combines with product evaluation. Uh so We all have to keep in mind what has changed now. So what we have left on the Because evaluation is based on the initial uh user requirements. Alright. Let's make it big. Um Well we evaluate uh the design with a seven point scale  as following. Well the remote controls according criteria blah blah blah. True or false  and then on a scale of seven points  a scale  as we all know it. Um Well the criteria are based on the user requirements  uh the trends from the marketing research  and the marketing strategy of the company itself. Um well they are in a Word document  which I will open now. Yeah. I don't know it's open yet. No. And we all have to uh agree on a certain level. What's this? Oh. I don't know. Um Well the first point is the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user. So that means the operating behaviour was using quite a lot of functions. How do you think about that? Yeah the us u It it it's it's mainly con mainly concentrating on a lot of functions  in this question. So do you think Yeah. You can you can ma Yeah  you can make a lot of extended menus. That's true. I mean the the possibilities are almost unlimited  to to build in menus in the screen. So on a scale from one to seven  what do you think? Huh? Two or three? Something like that? Well we have to choose one. So uh what do you say? I agree on two. Yeah. I uh I say two  personally. But Yeah well we have to evaluate I guess what we have now. Yeah? You say three  and you you said al also three? Three? Okay well I say still two  but it has to be three then. Yeah I know. So it's made bold. But it's nah  it's not very clear on the sc Maybe other colour  yeah. That's better. Uh Yeah. Alright. Oh  it doesn't have to be bold anymore. Alright. Yeah. Um well the remote control has Wha The remote control has irrelevant or less used functions. For example audio settings and screen settings. Yeah. Well  yeah. So it it's a very true point. I mean it hides all those function. But  I mean uh they're hidden in the screen. If you don't want to use them  you don't s you s just scroll over them. And you place them F I don't know where. So that's very true  I guess  for our case. Uh the second point. It shows the relevant and most used functions. Power button. Do we ha still have a power button? Well yeah the button's integrated  huh? Yeah we dropped it. You j you just push it in for Yeah just just push it in for th for three seconds or something  and then Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. Um it shows the relevant and most used functions. Yeah uh on the other uh on one side I would say yes  and the other side I would say no. So it's I don't know. Yeah. With the scroll butt Yeah and then say channel. And then Hmm? Yeah. Yeah. But but how do you change from volume to channel? No. No we have n we have no buttons left. So the joystick was not an option. So so you hav So you you have to double-click  I mean  for  I mean  uh volume  and three double click for the menu  or something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. But but ease of use was not very important  may I remind you. So that's Yeah but that that's not a question. Uh the remote control shows the relevant and most used functions. Well I think it's pretty much in the middle. You have to search for them in in the in the s in the screen  in the menu. So So maybe it's more like a f a five. Or Yeah. Five or six? Five? Alright. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Uh the the remote control makes use of technolog technological innovation like L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition. Well yeah but we dropped the speech recognition. But it has at least one innovation. I say two then. Yeah but that that's not that's not this question. Uh thi uh that's the other question. This one. Two yeah. I think L_C_D_'s more useful than speech What? Oh not the bold one. Right. Okay  it has a fancy look and feel by using fruit and vegetable prints  primary colours and sponge-like material. It should have been two questions. I realise now  because sponge-like material is dropped. But the look and feel Yeah. The button has also colour. Yeah. Yeah. The one. Mm mm. Yeah we have single curve now  and no and no material. So maybe in the middle or something. Yeah  I mean it's worth the Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But then we would have to drop the screen. Oh red. Yeah. Yeah. I like bold. Uh the remote control displays the corporate logo. Yeah. You just have to draw it. Yeah. But there's uh enough space for the corporate logo. I mean  if there's only one thing. Yeah. So I will say that is very true. Yeah. The remote control is easy to use. Well I would say Skill  uh I would say six  or something. I don't think it's easy to use  or not so. Yeah. Yeah. It it it has a nice screen. But Yeah. Yeah. Well I I would say a five or a six. What do you say? Easy to use? Five or a six? So a six  more. Yeah  uh I would go for the six too. So Um well  another question  uh the remote control is durable. I don't know if that's the correct word. But uh In use  both battery as casing? Yeah? True  true. And the casing is plastic ? Yeah. If you don't drop it too much  it's uh should last pretty long. Yeah? But uh I think rubber compared is better. So I think a two is more appropriate than Yeah. Logo. Okay I will go go for two. Uh the last one? The remote control's a good example for company's motto  we put the fashion in electronics. uh turn around. Yeah. But um Yeah? It's not Yeah  true. So a four. It's it g it g goes  it's not the best we could do  I guess. But it all has to do with the budget  because it's it's not the bad idea we had  so Alright  yeah. Right. So if I understood it right  we have to count these numbers. Uh Yeah. Mm-hmm. Oh Oh Alright. Word document  the Yeah we have to count them. Uh Yeah just add them and then uh divide them. Yeah. Mm. I all made it po I I all made it I all made it possible uh for a positive questions  so we can count it. I mean if you have reversed question  you have to reverse the scale  uh Yes. Yeah. Thanks. Oh Easy. Question number four  yeah? Yeah. How hard is it? Yeah just use Oh there tho uh there's no n There's no num pads. It's a it's a bit uh Yeah. I think you can just count them by a Um let's move over. Three  plus one  four. Nine. Uh  yeah. Are you here? Eleven. Fifteen. Sixteen  yeah. No sixteen. Uh sixteen plus six. Twenty two. Twenty two  yeah? Tw Twenty Twenty eight. Twen Uh okay. By nine. That's uh three uh Or le less than a three. Yeah. Twenty eight di divided by nine makes three point one one one one one one one. Yeah. Yeah  but there are no negative questions I guess. Good example. Durable use. Easy to use. This is good. Fancy look and feel  that's good. Technology innovation was good  because of a marketing uh requirement. Re relevant most used function. And hides these functions. That was also a good thing. And then matches the opera of the user was also a good thing. So it were all positive questions  by uh by purpose. So Yes  so the It tells us something  yes. Becau But the picture would be a lot different if we didn't have to drop those uh those things  I guess. Yeah. Nah it it's it's better than average  but Yeah. So th Yeah. No. The colour and the screen. Yeah we we have to maybe if we have to redesign it on this With some casing around it  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Do we have to do other things? Or just redesign? Alright. Yeah. So you made a start  right? Yeah. Alright. The the target group has a weak spot for fruit and vegetables  like primary colours  spongy shape. The playfulness  we decided to use kinetic energy as a power sour Okay. That's conceptual  yes. Mm. How many pages? Alright. Y you have you have done the first two. Okay  and and the look and feel is Yeah. The items we had to drop. Where did we start with price? Twenty six and a half. Or not? Or twenty six? Something like that. This? Speckles? Uh Yeah. Yeah. Some some big dots. Yeah. .... We have the original balance sheet  or Yeah. Woah. Just cut. Control Z_. Yeah. Yeah. Just dual screen. Very nice. Yeah. Y y you you you push the button or something. Or Lot of options. Yeah  the R_ and another R_. It's called the Real Remote  right? Maybe maybe it c it can say that. The Real Remote. Yeah. Welcome. Yeah. Yeah. You can copy and paste the picture if you want. Yeah. What is that? Look more Looks more like a campfire. Yeah. Yeah. Type in your report. I don't see any new messages. So Hmm? Luckily  yeah. What time do we have to deliver the report? Four o'clock or Or before that? Just compare uh No it's on the on the beamer I guess. Yeah. Strange. This something what's projection from behind  I guess. Yeah it it's a beamer  but then with a within a mirror  yeah. So it looks like a big screen  but in fact it isn't. Well it's it's single single curved. Th this is flat. Yeah. But it's it's better to have in the front  this kind of shape  because it looks nice. I mean you see more of this than of that. Yeah  more like that. It's not very uh ideal. Do like this. Yeah. What's this? Ooh. But I don't see a detector over there. I thought it was a kind of thing to put it on  and then draw right lines or something. Yeah. Or just messed it up. Yeah. Yeah but it wasn't good. Yeah it it has to touch the corners  I guess. But th this one wasn't good  because if I was drawing here  I drew a line and then it came over here. Oh. Ooh. Yeah yeah  it's it's okay. It's working again. It's better than before. Yeah. Yeah that's improved uh pretty much. Yeah. Yeah but it's better  it's better Mm. No. It's better than it was I guess. Silly. Yeah. Works pretty well. Five minutes before the meeting's over. And then? We have to present Alright. So it after the after after these five minutes  you have to Alright. After after that five minutes  you have ten minutes to finish it  or Alright. And we uh Right. Chill. Huh. Uh Yeah? Next slide. Yeah? How do you do it? Alright. Yeah. Yeah. And we move more to to working together as team  because at first you you make your individual contribution  and then come here  and you have no idea what the others have to make. And then finally you have some idea  okay this is gonna w this is what we gonna make together and okay I will arrange this and you will arrange that  and you have a k a kind of idea what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own. So The process  I mean  the interaction between us became better and better I guess. Yeah  especially if f f if you see uh you se you saw the largest difference from the first to the second meeting I guess. Yeah. Yeah. Li Limiteded afterwards  but If if you don't take that into account  there's plenty of room for creativ creativity. Also not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself  but also in explaining it to the other people  by means of uh the the board and uh PowerPoint and Word and stuff like that. Mm uh I think in in essence the digital pen is better than the SMARTboard. Because it it it just works better. I mean uh uh I've made yeah  uh I've made several notes just to test it  and and just put the pen in into it  and then it came onto my screen and it looked perfectly. So it it's better a better device than uh than the screen. But the screen is useful  in essence  but it doesn't work that well. Yeah. Yep. Warning. Finish meeting now. Well  it It's use especially useful  I guess  to to evaluate designs and graph graphical stuff. And and the screen and stuff like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But it it's useful to to show something to to an a small audience  and then to Yeah. These these kind of screens this size are useful to discuss things. So Yes. Check your email. You also. Right. Yes boss. Well see you soon. Yeah. Did you do your questionnaire already? Uh It wants Yeah but everything is. Just a normal battery then  yeah. Oh my goodness. Well I guess i we'll have to go for single curve then. I mean we have to drop on everything. Yeah. How about Sorry. That's what I was thinking. A a And uh 'cause then they don't have to n They don't need special colour as well. That was exactly my point. Like let's drop all the buttons  and just make one I mean we're gonna use the L_C_D_ screen anyway. So we'll just have to use it for everything. And then you can make an overview of channels in the screen  and select a channel  click Yeah we need one integrated button for everything then. Yeah. Kind of. I was Because Yeah. If you if you go to If you go to our uh view  like you if you are in the sound system there  uh and you wanna adjust the treble for instance  this is just uh an example  y y you wanna see a bar on which you can adjust it from zero to ten for example. But you want a sound preview of how it's gonna sound  right? So you wanna click on it  activate it  whe and when you move it  hear the difference of the treble coming out or going into the sound. So you'll you'll need a a kind of a joystick uh button. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah it's r Yeah. No. No but Yeah it's it's expensive  but uh we never considered the possibilities of uh speech recognition. 'Cause it can take the function of a lot of uh uh buttons. I No. Yeah but lets just say that the speech recognition works. We uh we we haven't really integrated this the speech into the system  so we can might as well s drop that. We need to lose some buttons. Which That's even Yeah  if you if you go to eight I don't know how to Yeah  we need the chip for the for the L_C_ display. Yeah. True. Oh. Hmm. Yeah uh You uh uh Yeah. So the other option would be to go for the the sample speaker  and Which can use a regular chip  wh which is six Euros in total. That doesn't matter. Well yeah. Exactly. Yeah but the uh can't we f uh fit all the buttons in an intreg integrated scroll push-button? 'Cause that will save us one and a half Euro already. And then if w Th then we have to scroll through a lot of menus to be able to get where you want  huh? And uh Yeah d at l Yeah. At least one for power. Oh. Yeah it's just as expensive as what we have now. Yeah endlessly. I mean it can be a power button as soon as it powered on. You can go into you in you main menu  you can choose uh flip channel  uh you can choose sound options  any options. Yeah. Maybe we should. 'Cause we don't have money and w we want the screen. I guess we have to. We'll we'll be on Yeah it says right here. Yeah. But we definitely want the thing to be a special colour though. Damn. Yeah and then Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Well  you only have to power it up when you wanna use it. I don't know.. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's the most import We only have Yeah but Well we come back to the drawing board then  huh? It's silly 'cause we we should have had this meeting before we start drawing. Oh yeah? okay. Drop everything. Yeah. We went straight into finance? For Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I think it does. Because the operating behaviour of the young user was also defined in colour and shape and the use of L_C_D_  right? Yeah. Well  we have extended menus  on the on the L_C_D_ screen. So I No. Yeah. Yeah alright. Yeah yeah. Definitely one. It has to be. You're not gonna find them. Yeah the next Not so much so. Yeah. Yeah it's uh it's integrated. E exactly just like a m mobile.. Well uh we should b build it so that if you don't kind of push into the menu or something  if When it's on  yeah  it's turned on  It automatically has the the programme and the volume function  but as soon as you click it you go into the menu or some Of you Or you double click it. No because it has four arrows  right? Oh yeah. Yeah I was thinking still about our uh integrated joystick. Say. Yeah that is a bummer. We'll make it a Morse code. Yeah. Yeah I would go for five or six  yeah. Okay five. Let's not diss our remote. Yep. Just one button. But Uh yep. We still have the fruit and vegetable print. Fr Oh I mean the Oh never mind. I'm a bit lost.. It's way more practical  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So we still uh we still have the primary colours. But only on the on the outside  not on the button. Yeah? Okay. Yeah. Yeah still we we dropped also on the the double uh curve. And and colour. Yeah. S Yeah. Uh Actually we d we didn't do so well on this one. Because it's basically an old one  uh with little curve on the side  and in a different colour. Still  it's still hard. I mean the sponge-like and the three D_ shape  that would give it something young and fresh. Of course. Yeah but it be because uh we couldn't hardly draw on the b s on the lower half of the screen  we could not make it big enough to actually draw in the So I mean I wanted to put digits on the buttons as well. But Hell yeah. If we have only one button. And even the shape we have now uh simulates kind of an R_ and the reversed R_  doesn't it? So No. The only e the only thing easy about it is that you don't have to move your fingers. 'Cause it has only one button. Yeah exactly. I would say six. It's really not easy to use. 'Cause you're putting everything Most votes count. Um Definitely in casing  'cause we have a hard plastic Yeah. Yeah because the the batteries  those thingies last forever. And the the casing  hard plastic also lasts forever. So I would go for one. Okay yeah. Oh. No m I would g I would go for four. Because we kind of tried to but we kind of failed with the budget that we have. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah. That's it. Ah we can do the math. Uh Yeah. Did you make this questionnaire or what? Oh. I wouldn't be able to do it that fast. F Pretty difficult. Just type in the digits. They're all one digit numbers right? And then you can count them together. Eleven. Fifteen. Sixteen. Seventeen. Oh what? How hard is this? Never mind. Twenty four. Twenty eight. Twenty eight. Yeah the lower the The lower the score the better  right? Yeah but But I Are you sure we this number actually tells us somethings? I don't think so because some questions are related to positive issues and some to negative. So if you give a true to a positive  it actually means that the low the lower the better. But if you give true to a negative question No? Durable  that's good. Easy to use. Yeah.. Also good. Yeah okay. I guess you did do it. Oh yeah yeah. No Okay. Okay. Yeah true. Yeah definitely definitely. Because now it's just an average It's remote. Yeah okay because of the L_C_D_ screen. But uh it looks and stuff  it still uh it's not  it's not really eye-catching  except for the colour. Yeah. Product evaluation. Shall we try? Black. Okay uh we're still gonna go for the fancy colours? But are we gonna stick with the green or are we gonna do blue? One scroll button and For what? Should give it some time? Yay. Have to take this away also. And this um Oh yeah  of course. Um pen yeah? Format. Current colour red. Oh Yeah we did our special colour for the Line widths  now that's a ten. It's gonna be one str scroll. Horizontal's easier too  'cause you can Is it more natural than this? So let's say Whoops. 'Kay. Basically. It's really ugly. Oh What do you mean? Like a other colour than this one? Yeah can we do it uh uh can we do a print? I think we have to choose  yeah? Okay special colour. We do have special colour. Does it mean uh that Shall we just give it some dots to make it look pretty? Purdy. Purple? Yeah yeah. Oh no my remote has acne. No. That's why we have that button. It's so cute. Doh. Is that that? How the We did we do that? We can try. That doesn't respond also to the undo. It looks like it's No  Where do you want some more dots? Okay  it's not the prettiest  I know. It's not so random huh? Yeah okay. We can make a l a logo. Like uh put it like the shape. Something like that. I mean it's not too uh That's not their logo  is it? Yeah. It's a How Shall we do the logo in black or not? Are you dissing my drawing? This one? It looks like a ribbon. So who wants to draw? This is actually quite fun. Do we need to do anything? I hear you people are typing. Oh  okay. It's almost four. At four  yeah ? This is really bizarre. It looks like there's a It looks like a butterfly. No  but it i It's not a bu a beamer. B It's a normal T_V_ screen  kind of thing. Oh. Yeah there is some kind of projection I think. With a with a mirror  huh? Or something. Yeah. So are we gonna change anything to this? I mean is it gonna This is gonna be flat. Yeah exactly. Yeah. Yeah. And this is also gonna be Nope. But sometimes then uh all of a sudden it does work. Maybe No it's I think you only need two points. Or not. No  you sh Slanted yeah. Yeah. Well maybe. Yeah it it matters for the aim of this thing. Yeah. Yeah it's only a bit like to that side  but that is that one by the way. 'Cause this one makes the angle either like this. So i if I change this  it will go there  if I change that  will go there. Mm-hmm. I will take this away 'cause it looks messy. Maybe we will. What's this anyway? It looks like candle wax. Uh th uh do you mean the the interaction between us? Or Yeah well at first I was really stressed. Because it went a bit fast. But then as I knew the tempo that I had to be on  the second time I think I did a bit better. And the third time yeah  I mean Yeah  yeah yeah yeah. Yeah we Mm-hmm. Yeah. Definitely. Well you did become more assertive the the second time round  so that Yeah. You were more in charge kind of thing. I guess so. I mean I We were pretty democratic. Yeah. Maybe Yeah. It's uh it's The the pen is more intuitive  'cause we're all used to writing with pen. And uh as I said  uh I uh have no idea how PowerPoint works  so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal PowerPoint presentation. But once I get to know the program probably  I mean  it looks better  you know. Or uh something like that. You can give it a kind of a home style  like we have i the the logo and everything. And I don't know. Yeah the the the problem with PowerPoint for me is that you have to i put in the pre-made chunks c as well. You know  you can draw something on the sketch-board and then take it there  or whatever. Alright. Alright. Well  s see you in a second huh?. Yeah we have to pull it this way  huh? Wait. ,The Project Manager reviewed the decisions from the previous meeting. The Marketing Expert made a presentation on trend watching  including trends in user requirements and trends in fashion. The Industrial Designer presented all the components of the device and announced that several of the features already discussed would not be available. He suggested substituting a kinetic battery for the rechargeable batteries and using a combination of rubber and plastic for the materials. The User Interface Designer presented his main interface design  which included buttons for the most frequently used features and a graphic user interface on the LCD screen for other functions  to keep frequently used features easy to use. He announced that speech recognition was still an option to consider  depending on price. The Project Manager then began a discussion to decide what was going into the final design. It was decided that a kinetic battery would be used in place of a rechargeable battery  that the remote will feature an LCD screen and rubber casing and rubber buttons  and that interchangeable rubber covers in fruit colors will be available. Speech recognition may be included if it is not too costly. 
Okay. Um welcome to our second meeting. This is the functional design meeting. And I hope you all had a good individual working time. Okay  let's get started. Okay  here's the agenda for the meeting. After the opening um I am going to fulfil the role of secretary  take the meeting minutes. And we're gonna have three presentations  one from each of you. Then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements. Um gonna come to a decision on the functions of the remote control. And then we're gonna close up the meeting. And we're gonna do this all in about forty minutes. Okay. First I want to discuss the goals of this meeting. First we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control. And then we're going to determine the technical functions  what is the effect of the apparatus  what actually is it supposed to do  what do people pick up the remote and use it for. And then lastly we're going to determine its working design  how exactly will it perform its functions  that's the whole technical side of 'Kay I'll just give you a minute  'cause it looks like you're making some notes. 'Kay. Oh  well let's go ahead and  back  previous. So what I wanna do right now is hear from all three of you  on your research that you just did. Who would like to start us off? 'Kay. Okay. Um do you have a PowerPoint or no? Okay. Oh. Save it in the project documents. Okay. Mm-mm-mm. This one? Okay. Okay. Okay. Right. Ready. Alright. Very good presentation. Thank you. You speak with such authority on the matter. Okay. Who would like to um follow that one up? Now  that we've discussed Okay. Do you want me to run it or you wanna Okay. Functional requirements. 'Kay. Alright. Now we have Courtney with the functional requirements. Okay  what do you m Oh  I'm sorry. What do you mean by um the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user  like they have to press the buttons. Okay. Oh  right. The buttons. Okay. Yeah. Okay. It works. Ready for the next slide? Hmm. It's okay. It's very important. Could be  yeah. Oh. I think that's a pretty good guess though. Yeah. It's okay. Okay. Next slide? User-friendly. And so just to just to clarify by speech recognition you mean they would say  channel five  and the thing would go to channel five? Okay. Oh  that'd be lovely. Didn't they um didn't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the T_V_ and it would the remote would beep so if you have lost it Mm. Oh  yeah  that's true. We could definitely include that if we wanted to. If it's within our price. Okay. Are we ready for our last presentation  Amber? Okay. There we go. 'Kay. Oh my bad. Okay. Ready? That's okay. Hmm. So this would be the front? So the red would be the front of the remote though  right? Okay. The l the light up kind of Yeah. Hmm. It'd probably be lighting up the key too  right? 'Kay. The buttons. Okay. Yeah  definitely. 'Kay nex R Ready? 'Kay  any p 'Kay? Anything you wanna add for personal preferences though  you f you said already that we needed a large on-off button  you think. Anything else? Okay. Mm. Okay. Okay  let's talk about all of our We'll come to decision later about all the components that we need to include  let's um wrap up this one  and I'm gonna go back to my PowerPoint  'cause we need to discuss the new project requirements which you might've already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier. Wait  come back. Alright. Sorry  let's go through this. Alright. Here we go. New product requirements. First it's only going to be a T_V_ remote. We're trying not to over-complicate things. So no D_V_D_  no TiVo  no stereo. It's not gonna be multi-functional. Hey. And we th need to promote our company more  so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote. We're trying to get our name out there in the world. Okay. And you know what teletext is? in States we don't have it  but um it's like they just have this channel where just has news and weather  kind of sports  it's very um bland looking  it's just text on the screen  not even Yeah  just black with just text. Yeah. Kind of. Yeah it's the whole screen. So anyway Right. Right. But it's becoming out-dated now  because of the Internet. Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news  and we have twenty four hour news channels now too  so Those are our new product requirements. Alright. Mm-hmm. Yes. It's part of the logo. Okay. What we're going to do right now is come to some decisions  definitive that we can all agree on  about um the target group and the functions and just definite things that we need to do and then we'll close up the meeting. So. Alright. Whatever. Okay. So our target group is You mentioned um older people? Would it just be universal for everyone  you think? Because I think even if something has large buttons  as long as they are not childishly large  like even technically non-technically challenged people are gonna use it. I mean they want something user-friendly  so Yeah. Yeah. Okay  so we want um for our target group would we say  I mean  young and old  all age ranges  all um  not kids obviously  right? Or kids? Okay  so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range Um what about technic technical um specifications  like how how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote? Okay. Right  okay. So so they need no technical experience to operate Okay. And we also need to determine the specific functions of this  just to get it all out on paper. So we said it needs to send messages to the T_V_  needs to change the channel  turn on and off  just basic simple stuff like this. So if you have something just say it and we'll add it to my meeting minutes. Mm-hmm  volume. Right. And we wanna keep um I'll make a note here that we wanna keep the number of buttons down. Correct  because people only use ten percent. 'Kay. Hey  what else? Um. I think so. What do you A finding kind of device or Yeah  ho homing device. Mm 'kay. Okay. Right. Hmm. Would that add to our costs at all  I wonder? Right. Okay. I I think we can make a decision about that later. Uh we'll still put that as a point that we need to discuss. So that would include battery source Power source rather. Is it going to have a charger  or is it going to be run strictly off batteries? And we also need to deal with the issue you mentioned of speech recognition  if we want that. Mm. You could um we could hook it up. Oh. Mm-hmm. And if and if we introduced it when they're this age  they're going to probably always buy a remote that has Right. Yeah. and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device  too. If we said  find remote  locate remote  or something. A certain phrase then it could beep. I dunno. Just throwing it out there. Well Okay  anything else we wanna discuss? Um. How how  yeah  how would you leave those out? Unless you could say the channel. Yeah  that's true. And also remember that in this day in age we need  you know  like a hundred button  too. I used to have a remote that did not even go up past like fifty. So I couldn't whenever I got cable  I had to get a new T_V_. Mm. get your own remote  or digital cable. 'Kay. Um. I guess  we're gonna discuss the project financing later  making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget. Um. 'Kay. And don't forget we need to include the colour of our company and the logo. I'm guessing. And the R_R_. We could just have the logo in yellow  or maybe a yellow light for the keys. Right. So we've simplified  we don't need all those um play  fast-forward  rewind  or no menu buttons. So we've pretty much pared it down to on-off  volume  mute  channel up and down  um the numbers Yeah. Um can we go back to I'm gonna look really quickly back at those examples and see if there is anything. Which one is yours  technical functions or functional requirement? Okay. The T_V_. I think that that's fine just for the T_V_. I mean how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff? Hmm. Couldn't we do that all through one button  something  a menu button  that pops up with a menu on the T_V_ that says  you know  audio  video  whatever  language  you know? For the menus. That's true. Something that looks mayb you know. Y right  right right right. That one? Right. In the middle perhaps. Yep. good. Anybody have anything else they'd like to bring up in this meeting? Okay. get out of here. Let's go back to the meeting closure then and see what we need to do next. Mm. Alright. After this meeting we're gonna be sent a questionnaire and summary again which we need to reply to that e-mail. And then we're gonna have lunch break. And after lunch thirty minutes of individual work time. Um I'm gonna put the minutes I put the minutes for the first meeting already in the project documents folder  if you'd like to review them. And I'm gonna type up the minutes for this one as well. Um here's what we're each going to do. The I_D_ is going to work on the components concept  um U_I_D_ the user interface concept  and you're going to do some trend watching. 'Kay. Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach. And if anybody has anything they would like to add? No? Okay  well  this meeting is officially over. Thank you all. Did you send it? Okay. Great. We only use ten per cent of our brains. yeah. Do we really need t to provide more information on what R_S_I_ is? Yeah  I'm just trying to move it. 'Kay. I think it should be there  working design. 'Kay. Uh I didn't get a chance to complete this one  'cause some of the tools that I was given were frustrating. Uh okay  so method method of our design  I think I just start listing th some of the things that we actually need to put into this. We need a power source  we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi-functional. Um extra functions will probably need an additional chip. Either that or the smart chip will have to be extremely smart. Usually a smart chip is just a chip that's been programmed and designed so that it can complete a fair range of functions. I wouldn't think so  'cause we could probably get it from like  in bulk  from a a newer company. And they tend to sell their chips pretty cheap. Um yep  nothing here. Um power source  I figured  batteries  'cause they're easily available. Typically a remote has either two double A_s or four triple A_s  sometimes three. Uh it really kinda depends on the size of the actual remote itself. Um a large on-off button  demographically we're moving towards an older generation of people  so a large on-off button would probably be good. Selection button for various entertainment devices  so you want something that will permit you to select the D_V_D_ player or the T_V_ or the stereo system. Um smart chip that perverts uh that permits  sorry  universal application again  something that'll allow us to skip over between devices  and that's kinda it. Uh this is my fifty second design. Power source over here. We're gonna have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it  and you're gonna need the switch. Um extra bulb could just be for flashiness  um subcomponent which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the the device. Um the chip and of course the infra-red bulb  so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to. This is just like a rough schematic. So this is the internal workings. Yeah. Yeah  so you don't have to stare at that infra-red  'cause you know when the battery starts dying in your remote currently  you have to actually stare at that bulb and go  okay  when I push this button  is it working? We can skip that whole thing. Yep. So you can put it in the dark. Yeah  that's it. I think that that's a good idea  because you know that's one of the most important buttons. Okay. You can also get the kind of the T_V_ guide so It's the entire screen is just running information at random. Seemingly. Okay. So  do we have to include the company colour within that? Mm well  even if we kept the regular standard size of remote  if we reduced the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra  'cause they're saying they only use ten per cent of them  then we should be able to accommodate fairly decent sized buttons. Most of them will intuitively pick it up though. how 'bout little to no  because there is no way that you are gonna be able to make it no. Do we want this thing to be able to be found easily? And like if this is gonna get lost underneath the coach  how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it? What if we gave it a charger? And on the charger  just like a phone  like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger  and if you d leave your phone somewhere  you push the button to find it  and it finds th the phone beeps for you. It's useful for the remote phone. Yeah. Rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually. Yeah. I think people would find that too foreign. It's when we get satellite. Yeah. Yeah  'cause I don't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment  so R_ the double R_. Or is the l Yeah  yellow could be and it could doesn't have to be huge. Mm-hmm. I had something  but I forgot. Do you want us to do our PowerPoints now or I can go. Yeah  you should run it. Mm yes. Yes  okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab  and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire  and we found that the users are not typically happy with current remote controls. Seventy five percent think they're ugly. Eighty percent want they've are willing to spend more  which is good news for us um if we make it look fancier  and basically w we just need something that really I mean there's some other points up there  but they it needs to be snazzy and it but yet simple. So that's really what we need to do. And we need we need it to be simple  yet it needs to be high-tech looking. So Like They like I guess use the buttons a lot. Yeah. I don't know. It's from my uh research. My team wasn't very clear. That's okay. I I think it's like the engineering versus user  whereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex and users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there  because they only use ten percent of the buttons really. Good point. It's a necessary evil. Mm-hmm. And so people say that they typically lose it  as you yourself know  because you probably lose your remote control all the time  much like any small appliance like a cellphone  and they we need something simple  because most people  well thirty four percent say that it's just too much time to learn how to use a new one  and we don't want to go we don't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote  but I mean they do need to be able to identify it  and R_S_I_  I'm not very sure what that is. Yes  it is important for the remote control world. Sh Uh possibly. Uh yeah  that's what my web site said  I don't know. Yeah  I would assume so. I think we're supposed to know it as remote control experts. But also s so the channel  the volume and the power buttons are the most important on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used  but those are the definitely the top ones. Yes. And so personally I think that we need a modern eye-catching design  but it it really needs to be simple. So saying from y your slide  your presentation  the engineering versus the user-specified remotes  I think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly. Where the engineering ones  the boxes  tend to make it look more complicated than it really is. Um the functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it. And it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers  so even though we need a small number of buttons  we also need to take in like are most people going to be using it for a D_V_D_ player  a TiVo  what what exactly are we using it for  as well as the age range. So we need a hip  but not a corny marketing scheme for promoting our product. And also we found our team found that speech recognition is it's like an up-and-coming thing they really consumers are really interested in it  and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote for it to be more high-class we could consider it. I guess so  yeah. Yeah  I guess we can interpret it like  we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme. Oh that's fine. What exactly is a smart chip? So what exactly we are looking at  is this like the front of the remote? Oh okay. Like that we know the battery's working. Okay. Yeah. Yeah  and that's good. We should make it glow in the dark. Mm 'kay. I think we should. Like I think that would be in a as in like in for the design  sorry  um. I think we should definitely go with buttons that don't look like a normal remote  'cause most remotes have small square buttons  I think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles. What is it? Like running along the bottom? Wait  is it like the Weather Channel where it's got like the ticker running on the bottom or something? So it's like a separate channel from like what you're watching? Okay. No  kids need to know how to use a remote  I would think. They gotta change between Disney Channel  Cartoon Network. Yeah  I think we need it all. Um I would say we should say dumber than the average person. Yeah. And channel. Yeah. Those are the most important ones. Yeah. Sure  yeah. I need we we need a like homing device. Because people really are looking for a remote that's more high-tech. Do you think people'll really go for that though? Because Yeah. I would think so  because you'd have to develop a base. Hmm. Right. Do w Well  th there's the people who desire speech recognition  there's the different demog demographics have different desires  I don't know if you guys ge It wouldn't copy onto the the thing 'cause it's black  but all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition. So basically older people don't really care. It's really the people twenty five to thirty five. I feel those are the people that really watch a lot of T_V_ though. They're the ones that get addicted to soap operas and just sitcoms and stuff. Right. So Right. Yeah. Wait  on the remote itself? Well  we definitely need those. Yeah. You definitely need Wait. I feel like a ye I feel like a yellow one would be too garish. Or put like stripes  oh yeah  yellow lights. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  audi audio settings and screen settings  we need those like audio settings mono  stereo  pitch  screen settings like brightness  colour  or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself? Yeah  'cause we need to we definitely need to have buttons for like sub-titles and things like that. It's 'cause the foreign film market is expanding and stuff  and like on television like I know f k living in Los Angeles it's tons of Spanish network television if it has English sub-titles it's definitely helpful. So we need up  down  and side-to-side buttons. Yeah  okay. Okay  yeah. Such as  yeah  the one the one over there on the left the engineering centred one. Ooh  I just got an idea for a design. I don't mind going first. Yeah  it's in the should be in the m Project. You know you could you could do it yourself actually. Put it in Project Documents  yeah. Sure. Yeah. Okay. Um well  the function of a remote control  as what uh we've been informed  is basically to send messages to the television set  for example  switch it on  switch it off  go to this channel  go to channel nine  turn the volume up  etcetera. Um some of the considerations is just um for example the what it needs to include it's the numbers  you know  zero to nine  so you can move to a channel  the power button on slash off  the channel going up and down  volume going up and down  and then mute  a mute function. And then functions for V_H_S_  D_V_D_  for example  play  rewind  fast-forward  stop  pause  enter. And enter would be for like  you know  the menus. And then other menus for D_V_ as well as T_V_  whether that means like um we can go and decide the brightness of the screen  things like that  all the more complicated functions of menus. And we can decide if that's what we want   um if we want to include that on the remote  if that's something that would stay on the T_V_ itself  for example. These are two examples. Um and you can see on the left  it's got a lot more buttons  and I don't know if you can read it  but it says  step  go to  freeze  um slow  repeat  program  mute  and so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of s one example. And then on the right  it's a lot more simpler  it's got volume  it's got the play the like circle set  which is play  rewind  but it's also what is fast-forward is also like next on a menu. So you have functions that are d uh duplicating. And you have a mute button and then the numbers and the eject  and the power button. So that gives you two different kinds  a more complex and more simple version. Okay. And then lastly  it's just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include  and how simple  complex it should be? And what functions it needs to complete. Uh  what are needed to complete insulation process  'cause  you know  that's something that also has to be considered and it's gonna be hopefully a one-time thing  when you set it up it should be set to go  but we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up i in the first place. So that's it. Mm. Left. Wait. And that meaning what? Okay. Right. Only use ten percent of the buttons. Lost. S Wait  is that like your ergonomics like your hand movements or something? Like Channel  volume  power. It's like if you're holding it to just say  where are you  and thing beeps  you know. Yeah. It's kinda like what the remote phone used to do. You know like go to the base. Yeah. Working design. Help me. Well  how much extra would the additional chip be? Is that gonna push us over our production costs? Mm-hmm. Yeah  that's gonna be what's communicating with the T_V_  but the other bulb  I think  is good to just to indicate  I'm doing something  it's sort of like a reassurance. Yeah. Just Well  should it be larger buttons in general  you know like uh the examples that I had  they were swi quite small. So should we try and go for something that has l larger buttons? Ovals. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. I know. Yeah  it's like black  black and white kind of It'll give you the sports. Except the entire screen. You can pick sports  you can pick the news  you entertainment  you know it's like Yeah. Company colour being yellow. Mm-hmm. It's gonna make it nicer. Yeah. We should go for the lowest denominator. High school educated. Well it's channel  on-off button  volume  mute. Um. Oh right yeah okay. Tracking. But you got a base. Well  if you have the base  you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery. Yeah. Well  then we could If we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled uh demo demographic. Well Well  then then do you put the voice recognition do you put the r like receiver on the actual television  in the base  or in the actual remote  'cause then you've already got remote in your hand  why you just gonna speak to the remote  whereas if you just speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it. Still fifteen minutes. Um. Well  do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine? Can we conceive of leaving them out? Yeah  like you have one  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine  zero. Well  I don't know  I mean  if you can like well I don't know  if there's just a way of leaving them out? The colour being yellow? And how do we Can't make it entirely Well if you have like a Hang on. If you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom the base of it  just like yellow with the R_R_. Right  yeah. Two examples. Yeah. Oh  it's a Yeah. Well  the other option is sort of like down at the bottom  like farther away  you just have this sort of box inset where it's like the buttons that you don't use as much  but occasionally you will use. and so it's like I don't well  I don't know. Right. Well  that could be No you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons. Channel is just up and down. And then add a Yeah. So we just have it like add a menu button then for the various things needed  including v voice recognition if we have any like settings for voice recognition now included in the menu. ,The project manager went over the agenda. The industrial designer gave a presentation about the options for power source  materials and components. He recommended using kinetic energy  and having a double-curved rubber case. The group decided to combine batteries and kinetic energy. The marketing expert reported on current trends among young people for fresh fruity colours and spongy material. He explained that the remote should look fancy  and be technologically innovative and easy to use. He suggested using removable customisable covers  speech recognition  installing some games into the remote  and implementing a parental control feature. The user interface designer talked about having a simple layout with not many buttons. Most features will be controlled through the menu. The group discussed the various options and decided to use games but not speech recognition. After a lot of discussion they decided to implement a simple parental control feature. The project manager talked about what he had learned at a masterclass on knowledge management. The group discussed how to incorporate the company logo and motto onto the remote  including having an animated logo on the touch screen. The project manager gave the group instructions about what to do before the next meeting. 
Hi. Mm-hmm. Interface designer. Yes. Yes. Okay  I can start first. Okay. Now my slide  please. Three. Participant three. Yes. Okay. Now as an interface designer  I would give more emphasis on the interface  how the remote looks like so that it is sellable  it is attractive to customers. Next  please. Okay. Now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television. This messages could be uh switch on-off message or switch to next channel message or swapping the channels or switching onto a particular channel  like you can have the numbers one  two  three  four  up to nine. Pardon me? Yes  nine numbers. And then you have swapping of uh button by which using which you can swap the channels if you don't want to see the third channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa. Then it should have a next button  and next button channel by which you can keep on uh v uh mm eh scrolling the channels one by one. Next slide  please. Then you should have a button which should which ca which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume. Then  there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television. For example  if you are watching a French program and you would like to have a subtitles in English  then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see uh the the subtitles on the screen. Then there should d uh there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour  colour of the picture  the contrast  sharpness  brightness of the picture. Now there should be a memory switch. There should be a mute button. Suddenly if if if uh uh viewer he gets a telephone call  and if he want he doesn't want to switch off the uh T_V_  but he he can reduce the sound  he can bring the volume down and he can watch he can uh while talking he can watch the T_V_. Now the most important feature I would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature. It's an integrated progra programmable sample sensor speaker unit. So a remote can be th can be uh designed which can have the voice recognisers  you can record your own voice which can be recognised by as voice recogniser in the television  for example  if you want to see we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel  uh th now the the uh yeah  the remote will automatically it will switch to the ninth channel. So the T_V_ will have some recogniser which will recognise the user's voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities. So this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have. So this is one one of the interface which can be created. A very simple interface which has all the t uh uh important features. Then  please  next slide. Then  these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and colour  but they have many buttons. So uh sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognise which button is for what function and all that. So you can you can design an interface which is very simple  and which is user-friendly. Even a kid can use that. So can you go on t t uh to the next slide. Yeah  so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vi voice recogniser. And this has multi-purpose use  it can be used for T_V_  it can be used for cable-satellite  it can be used for V_C_R_  D_V_D_s and audio. And this has in-built voice recogniser. Can you go on to the next slide? Yeah  now this is an interface for a chil uh for a remote uh uh which a child can use. Uh this is user-friendly  it's very attractive and uh children can use it as well as they can play with it. And this comes with different colours  different shapes. And this this uh child uh interface has minimum buttons and all the important uh buttons are there in this small  compact  attractive child interface. Next slide  please. Now this is a big over-sized remote which cannot be misplaced or it's impossible to misplace. this. So this is No this is a very big  you cannot misplace it anywhere. So this is a jumbo universal remote control and it's impossible to im misplace or lose. This i this is one such interface which can be created. And the personal preference uh would be a spe uh uh to incorporate speech recognisers uh which will respond to user's voice for a particular uh function. Thank you  that's Mm yes. Okay. Okay. We can. It works. Mm yes. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Transmit. Okay. Okay. Push-buttons. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Uh yes  I would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser. This could be uh one feature which could be sellable. Mm-hmm. No  it's it's  uh yeah  it it's like your recording of uh all uh um a question already  and then you're expecting an answer from th For example  you have a T_V_ system  I'm the user and my family members are the user  I will already record uh a question like  uh good morning  like around eight o'clock I want to see the news in the television. So I'll say just good morning and the T_V_ will switch on. It will recognise my voice and will switch on. Battery. Yes. Yes. And compact. Trendy design and compact. Yes. Push-buttons. And Supplements like different types of features buttons  like can have a f mute button or a swapping button. Recogniser. Yes. Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Hi. Yeah  I think that pretty much is it. Yeah. Mm-hmm. You don't know me. I could lose that in a minute. Well  um looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there. Um what uh I'm No suggestion's bad. But uh we're gonna have to narrow it down a little more. I don't think that we can get uh The T-shape is good  the child one is good  the too big to misplace  I think it's just funny. Um I don't think that's gonna be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter. It's it's gonna be a little bit too unwieldy. Yeah mm. Mm-hmm. Have to come back to that later. Okay. No  I think her presentation was good  and she really explored all the options. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Good point. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yes. Yes. Okay. Hmm  that's interesting. Uh yeah  on the scroll and the push-button  um ca you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button? Mm-hmm. Um. We'll just go for push buttons for in the interest of cost. Okay. Okay. Go right to my first my next slide. Um alright  my method is uh I'm interested in what the competition is doing  and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition  so I've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers. I s I spend a lot of time on the internet um surfing around doing the same thing. And then when I'm out um in people's houses or at meetings or anything like that  I try to notice what kind of remote controls people have  and if it's convenient in the conversation I ask about it. And I would encourage you all to do the same. Um and my findings from this is that  you know  small is beautiful. Um people like something that really fits in their hand. Simple is beautiful. They don't want to have to squint at small print um  they want buttons whose functions are obvious  and they want um as few buttons as possible  and they don't care for the mode thing. They want each button to do something. And eye-catching is important. It's gotta look cute  it's gotta look appealing. Go ahead  I'm trying to finish fast for you. Um and our preference is  as far as I'm concerned  are we got to get to the market before the competition. Ours has to be look really great and it has to come out before the others  so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their Christmas item. And we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign. If we try to tell people it has too many great features  um the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere. So we've gotta narrow our selection down to li two things  I think  that we gonna say are really great about our our our new product. And I've been looking around um at what designs every year different things are popular. And in my research this year I found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular. And people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal. They are more back into soft feel  spongy feeling things  things with maybe a little cloth on them. So those are things maybe we wanna look at as far as saleability of the item. Mm-hmm. You wanna try to come back to yours  and limit yours a bit? Okay. So speech recognition is most important as far as you're concerned? Yeah h that could that could that could be our star feature. That that be really good  yeah  I agree with that. Distance problem? Uh. I think I think battery  and I think we all agreed on that. That that's that's gonna be most cost-effective and the best thing. Yep. Bright  colourful  trendy trendy design  and strong. Mm-hmm. Well  I think that Yeah  or or like her speech recognition would also be a supplement. Her speech recognition feature would be a supplement. Okay  so why don't we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is. Okay. Wherever they're hiding? Hi. Yeah  good. Hmm. Yeah. Going to the nex next. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah  maybe. Participant two. Uh the next one  sorry. It's it was the old one. Components. Um this time I'm I'm going to um concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design. Uh  can you go on to the next slide  please. I have just brief uh down few uh components which we require for the remote control uh construction. Uh the first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit  battery  etcetera  etcetera  it's like Uh it can be a plastic one  hard plastic  so that it can be strong  even if you just uh uh  you know  if you if it falls down  then it doesn't break. So it should be strong. And uh uh there are no harmful materials used in that. And it should be recyclable. Uh and uh  yeah  and also uh using of colouring compon components like uh if we want to have different colours  blue  red  green  so uh uh we have to use uh some colouring compone compone components. And uh the second important thing is uh uh uh integrated circuit. Uh which uh we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the it's like the heart of the remote controller. If it is not efficient then everything wi is going to be uh like um the lef ess less efficient so it you should we should have a highly sophisticated one. And it should be resistant to high as well as uh low temperatures. Suppose if it is thirty-eight degrees outside forty degrees outside  it should it should uh be able to re uh resist the uh temperature uh uh highs and uh high temperatures and low temperatures. And uh it should be with uh um equipped with timer and alarm facility. And the uh other component we should uh we have in the remote controller is a resistor uh which is like uh uh i it is very very much important for the electricity uh flow through through through the uh remote controller and uh also a capacitor which is a b which is a m I think it's it's like a battery  capacitor. Can you go on to the next slide  please? Uh a diode  a transistor  a resonator  these are all this uh technical uh electri electronic compons uh components which are which we have to use in a remote controller. A battery uh  I would like to suggest one thing uh if we uh if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery  even if it is a low performance battery it ca it can't l it can't charge much. It it it's not a high voltage battery. Then also we can If it is a rechargeable one  then uh people can use it for a long time  so in that way we can cut cut the cost  but w uh uh that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one. And we we have a circuit board uh in a remote controller. Can you go to the next slide  please. And how it works  how the remote controller works. When you press a button Thank you. Uh when you press a button  when you do that  you complete a specific connection that means when you when you press a button there will be a s a small circuit underneath the button  and it will send some signals through the wires  and then uh the chip will send start connection and knows that which button is pressed. Suppose you have pressed channel one button  number one you have pressed  then the uh chip will know that the number one button was pressed. It pros produces a mors morse code line signal specific to that button. Every button  every individual button  has its own morse code. Suppose uh the uh user has pressed butto button one  then it will have a spe the circuit will generate a specific morse code to b that that button  and the transistor will amplify the signal and send then to the L_E_D_ which translates the signal into infrared light. Like you have got a signal by pressing a button. That's a d a morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit. Now  that signal  that morse code  has to be amplified by the transistor. That is the use of transist transistor we which we use in the remote controller. It will amplify the signal and it will send it to the L_E_D_ and which translates the signal into an infra infrared bits. The sensor on the T_V_ can see the infrared light  and seeing the signal seeing the signal re it reacts appropriately  that when it sees the amplified mo morse code signal  then it will uh it will uh know which uh what what action it has to uh do. Then it will do the appropriate action. So uh this is how the remote controller works. Can you go to the next slide  please. Yeah  I have few pictures. When you look at the uh um remote controller uh it's it's it this is a normal remote controller. And to the next slide  please. And where we had a a few buttons and all. And uh if you open the remote controller you have this circui circuit board and few electronic components  like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins  and also a capac uh a capacitor  three resistors and also a resonator uh um mm yeah  and di and a diode transistor. The electronic components uh all of the electronic components have all those uh things like a chip and d diode transistors an Yeah  di um can y uh you can see the T_A_ double one eight three five labelled uh chip um. Uh you can also see the uh uh the green two green things are uh these are they are they are resistors  and uh just beside that you can see a transistor  and a uh uh cylinder shape  uh that one is a capacitor. Uh and also there are uh um resistors uh sorry  ther there is a diode. Can you go go on to the next slide. So uh this is the circuit board. The green one is a circuit board. Actually  uh building a circuit bo board is pretty pretty uh easy and also it's a it's a l l inexpensive. Uh it's it costs less than what you print on a paper  because uh uh when you when you are building uh some circuits some um uh circuits and also wires  it's it's better to go for printing  because uh you can build these kind of k circuit boards on a on a bulk and it's just printing  nothing like uh  you know  you don't need to use wires and all. It's not exactly wires we are using. It's just printing something on a board. Tha tho those prints will acti act as wires and ci uh circuits. So th that green uh thing is a circuit board  and also you can see uh there are b s like uh um access for buttons  like when you press a button  the circuit under the button will be activated uh th it will it will he get some signals from it and it will uh it will ch its ch se send a signal signals to the  yeah  um integrated circuit. Can you go to the next slide  please. Uh so this is these are the circuits un underneath the buttons. Uh can you see the black uh  round marks? They they are the circuits. Next  please. And um like uh we have uh designed uh before we have seen some uh few things like instead off buttons we have some scrolls. Uh b but a b a push-button requires a simple chip underneath it  but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range. Like for s scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and and k uh uh uh full a complete chip. Uh and a as energy source we offer a basic battery  a more ingenious uh hard dynamo  um a kinetic provision of energy  more than what is that you shake casually to provide energy. So that also we can have in a battery  uh or we can use solar sells. Uh. Yeah. Uh yeah uh the product can be de delivered into different cases. Uh usually  the cases and card flat that w we see usually uh d uh a normal remote controller. Um. Yeah. Yeah  maybe d uh I have just one more slide  I think. Um. Like we can have a ma material such as plastic  rubber  wood  titanium  but titanium we can't use. Um and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular um re or an advanced chip on the print  um also infra it includes the infrared se sender. Um yeah the uh for the movie just to j develop uh samples and so spe sample speaker. An Yeah  that's it. It's all for me now  thank you. No  no  no  th the the the scrolling wheels are different  like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls  uh which which we used to do before ten ten years before  I think. Now  nobody uses that because you need you need a a k sophisticated chip and all. So I think it's better we go for uh um ordinary buttons. Yeah uh yeah  push-buttons. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah  but w Yeah. Yeah  but but I what I'm uh very very much doubtful how how uh far it will work  because a speech recogniser like i it it has its own uh uh problems  issues. Yeah  it's not distance problem it it's recognising a person's voice  like maybe different people will be having different voices  so it like it's uh everything so i So to get a good recogni recognising system  it's a costly thing  I think. Mm-hmm. Yeah  but Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And also strong. Trendy  yeah. Uh. Um like the switches  like we use buttons for user interface. Push-buttons. Yeah. Mm yeah. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Thank you. Okay. Hello everyone. Um how uh how we doing? Uh first we going uh over the minutes of the last meeting  more or less. Um in the last meeting uh the marketing manager had presented uh her method of working  meaning gathering i suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market uh this this product at the within the budget uh that was given. Uh in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use. Um it's also an item that people lose a lot. So we should address that. And  of course  it should be something s s that is very simple to use. In addition to that to make it sell  of course  uh the marketing manager w wishes that it be very attractive  or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another so that the people are buying it now because  in particular with smaller items  that's a very important fact  'cause um if they say  well  I go home and think about it  that won't work. Um also mentioned was it should be uh it should have a very short learning curve. And maybe it could be sold by using a slogan. Our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have a chip that has infra-red bits and it has an interface controls w interface that controls the chip. Therefore  messages uh will be controlled in the same manner. There should be extra features like lid buttons  maybe a beep. If too many buttons are pressed  mm uh uh child lock um and uh maybe a display clock so that people could um you could see the time  you know  what show they want to watch. Also mentioned was uh maybe different shapes. So the components of the thing should be button  bulbs  infra infra-red bulbs  battery  chips  wires  and maybe some kind of a holder uh for the for the uh item. Francino who is our um interface designer um uh has mentioned that the that it  of course  should have an on-off button  and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock. Particularly with maybe small children that they couldn't uh watch a channel that is undesirable. It should be compact. Her personal favourite was it should be T-shaped. And maybe have an anar alarm-clock. And the material should possibly be not of non-allergic nature. Uh the different systems uh that exist are infra-red or radio-waves. Uh maybe it should have uh electri electrici electricity saving feature. And even possibly a timer to so that people can program their favourite uh uh program on th right from the remote. Uh are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time? Okay. Okay  then we I'm looking for three presentations. And uh I don't know whether the order matters much uh  I don't I don't think so  so whoever w wants Yeah  okay. Okay  your slides. Okay. Oh  come on  close already. And that's number two  right? Three. Okay. Nine what? Nine channel uh switches? Nine channel switches? Is Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm. Okay  thank you very much. Uh any comments on uh her presentation? Yeah  I I th I think No  I think the these are her presentations  but uh as far as the decision making we getting to that after after but if I just wanted to know whether anybody had any any anything to add to her presentation. Mm right. Mm-hmm. Ho who wants to go next um? Mm-hmm. Okay  and you Uh okay. Oops. The components design. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Go away. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. And you have more pictures. Uh we have five minutes to the end of the meeting. Okay  well thank you. Any particular comments by anybody? We don't have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision  and the marketing expert has to present her her thing. Uh okay. Okay. Uh that concludes the presentation of everyone. And what we really have to decide in this meeting is um the concept of the remote. And uh so what do we think on the concept of the remote? Y Okay. Mm-hmm. I think that's Mm-hmm. Well  you you teach You have to teach uh Okay  before we get too far off here um  the components of the concept is the energy. What kind of energy do we foresee? Battery. Battery. Okay then chip on print. Okay. And the case. And I think we all agree on the case  we wanna have something uh maybe bright  colourful. Mm-hmm. Trendy design  compact and strong. User interface concept  uh interface type  supplements. That will be your area I think  right  Jana. Put uh k I guess uh for yeah. And Not sure what they mean by supplements. Oh  like Oh. A what? Right  right  right  mm-hmm. Right. Okay. Uh our next meeting will be in thirty minutes  and the uh I_D_ is to this is the individual actions to be taken until then  to have the look and feel design  and uh the U_I_D_ is supposed to uh come up with the user interface design  and the marketing expert with the product evaluation. In this phase  the two of you  Jana and Francine  have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay  it says here. You will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches. Um if you have any questions  you know  you you can always uh contact me um or uh or your coach  I suppose. Um so um I think we conclude the meeting here and we come back in uh uh thirty minutes  according to our timetable here. Thank you very much. ,The project manager opened the meeting by stating the agenda and then introduced the upcoming project to the team members. The team members then participated in an exercise in which they each drew their favorite animal and discussed why they liked the particular animal. The project manager briefed the team on the production and selling costs of the remote they are to create. The project manager also briefed the team on the profit aim and discussed how many remotes must be sold in order to reach the profit aim of 50 million Euro. The team then discussed their experiences using remote controls and what features in terms of functionality and appearance to consider in making the remote. 
Thanks. Yeah  that's probably a better one  to discuss it straight away. Um I have a lot of the information there. It might not be very clear. Unless you want to plug it back in to yours. I think the scroll wheel um Yeah  and if we're going for sleek and sexy  I think a scroll wheel is maybe a bit kinda bulky? I I've got um pictures well I've seen pictures with it kind of sticking off the side of it  and they don't really look great. Yeah  a simple pushbuttons. Hmm. But But the way that I interpret that um it doesn't seem to send out a signal to the telly  it just it's like a parrot just rep reply replying to your message. So I don't think it would effect our circuit board. Yeah. And I don't think you could really perform any of the remote functions with it. 'Cause the example that they've given there is good morning coffee machine  good morning Jo. It might be useful to say like where are you remote. Here I am  Jo. But I think that's maybe as far as that one could go? Yeah  just as a fun way to find it. And it says that I think it said the cost of that isn't too much. Um I think it would be helpful to find it  but I don't think it'd um Yeah  I think so. Mm-hmm. I think I'll just just check what it said. Actually I don't think it really says anything about the cost  but it says that it's already in the coffee machines  so like it's already kind of Um. Oh  that was quick. Um okay  so very brief presentation  um. From looking at the remotes that are out there at the minute  none of them are particularly um sleek and sexy. Um I haven't actually got the examples of the scroll button there  um but there's some curved cases that you can see  uh a range of sizes uh. All of them have a lot of buttons there um they seem to just have the rubber buttons. Does that move it? It just seems to be skipping on without us doing anything. Ah it's alright. Um. There wasn't much more to say about that  just rambling. Um some of the uh remotes that I looked at  one of the models da did actually have voice recognition where you could um where it was connected to the remote control functions. And uh it was quite uh a swish model  where it can control uh four devices  T_V_  cable  satellite  video  D_V_D_  audio. Um so that's a bit of competition there. So I mean maybe it's better not to try and compete with that sort of thing and just to market it as a completely different um like different viewpoint as a kind of finding your lost control rather than trying to compete with the functions. Um the scroll buttons  as you've already mentioned  um there's examples of those  but they don't look as sleek as other models. And there's no real advantage and because it impacts on other on the materials and the price it's not great. Um Yeah. Th there was a specialist type of remote that we could think about  um. There was children's remote  where um they just had a very limited range of buttons and they were b uh bright and colourful and um you you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels. Um but I don't know if that's really in our field? But that's something that's out there. Hmm. Hmm. Okay. Right well that's something that we can be aware of. Um. I think because there's already um very good voice recognition technology out there  and because ours might not cover the same functions that the leading brands do  it might be a good idea to market it as a um finder function. Yeah. Oh yeah. Different languages might not be compatible. Hmm. Yeah  'cause I think you program um this one yourself  like to say like whatever you want to your question. Hmm. Maybe unless something else comes up. Um yeah I think um I think we've decided that it's gonna increase the cost and give no real kinda extra benefit and it's gonna decrease from the sleekness of it. Hmm um and just to be aware that there are kind of specialist functions and specialist remotes but we probably don't want to focus on those like such as the children's remote. Yeah. Um there was a mention just as kind of a warning about button design. Um just to avoid ambiguity. So it gave the example of say your volume buttons for up and down  they might both have a V_ on for volume  Um let's think how they did this. I'm just gonna check so I do this right. Um. What did they say? Um I think the thing was that if you decide to do this  to have triangular buttons  um somebody might look at this one and say oh well this triangular button is pointing up  and that's the first thing that they see Actually that can't be right  can it? Oh well  no  they might see yeah  they might see this pointing down and think right that's gonna turn the volume down  whereas the actual button's pointing up  so the function is to turn the button up. So  be careful what you put on the buttons and be careful of the shape that you make them  because they might be kind of two um contradicting kind of shapes. Yeah. Um and I think that's all I had to say for that. Um so what was the decision on the um design of the volume button? Oh okay. I think if you start making the buttons fruit shaped  it might make it more complicated to use. Yeah. Maybe just one button  say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions. Maybe that could be a little apple. And then that wouldn't get in the way of like kinda one to nine  and it wouldn't confuse the numbers. Hmm. S But I suppose as long as it's quite a subtle design  um even if the design kind of changes  It seems like you're gonna have rubber cases  as well as buttons. And that you can make them curved or double-curved and that would be the kind of sleek and sexy look. Oh right  that fits  doesn't it? Right. And that would fit in with what we want  wouldn't it  for the spongy feel  to have everything rubber. Hmm. Yeah and then you could have Oh but you still would have to have the logo on every new case  but you could have like pink cases for girls and red ones and things like that. Hmm. But we are supposed to use the um company colour scheme  aren't we? We haven't really seen that yet It might and we might be able to do both but it might clash with certain things. Hmm. Well if it's for young people  um like the phone generation  that sort of thing'd probably go down well  and the market research has been on that side of things  hasn't it? Okay  so if we just went for one colour of a rubber case Did we decide on the rubber case? The spongy feel  or did we think that that might go as a trend? Uh we haven't really talked about uh the curvature of the case. There's flat  there's single-curved and there's double-curved. I'm not exactly sure what these things look like. Well it says that I'm not exactly sure. Um I'll show you the remotes that I've got. See how uh Let's just get that bigger. See how uh the one Oh I'm not plugged in  am I? That doesn't help. Shall I just turn it round for time? Hmm. Um it's not very clear up there  but you can see some of them have got kind of bulges  like the second one and the end one uh where there's a curve there. I'm not exactl I don't know if a double curve is maybe it comes up slightly  or? But um it is a kinda sleeker look if you've got curves in there. Definitely a single  maybe a double. Shall we go for single curve  just to compromise? Yeah. And the rubber push buttons  rubber case. Um and we don't really know much about the colour scheme or logo yet do we  but possibly a sticker. Yeah. Yeah and and the voice recognition  we can use that can't we  just to find it. Without affecting the circuit board. Yeah that sounds like it wouldn't do too much harm in a couple of years. Uh what sort of shape do we want? Yeah  so it's not too wacky. Um I think an apple would be a good recognisable shape. If you start getting into kinda aubergines and things  it gets a bit weird. Vote? Shall we vote on it? Anyone got any suggestions? Right. Okay. Ah. Well it could be red. Yeah 'cause we wanna incorporate a bit of colour if we can  once we find out um Yeah. Yeah that seems pretty straight forward. 'Cause most of them will just be kind of mainly circular or like very plain. Uh just to keep the shape of the buttons simple. Ah just the uh shape of the buttons. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So are we going for the w are we going for the simple one  are we? Okay. Yeah. Mm. I suppose we need we need to find out what circuit board that requires  maybe before we m make a decision. Oh yeah  I suppose so  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Just Just just for the call and find thing. 'Cause it's s it's separate isn't it  it's not part of the Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah and ours is quite a cheap device  so I don't know how much we'll be able to put into it. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. I've I've got some things to say about possible design things from trend watching. Cool. Right  um I've been looking at some trends in in sort of basically fashion on top of doing the um research into the remote control market the the one that's the one I talked about last time  that we'd sort of asked people about remote controls and what what was good about them  what was bad  what they used. And we've also been looking at sort of fa sort of fashions and what people are wanting out of consumer goods at the moment. So we've had people in Paris and Milan watching the uh fashion trends. So So just to summarise the most important things which came out of the remote control market investigation. The most important thing was that the thing sort of look and felt fancy rather than just functional. And second  there should be some technological innovation. And then third and l less important than the other two  there should be an ease of use as well. And apparently  the fashion trends are that people want sort of clothes and shoes and things with a fruit and vegetables theme. Um but um the feel of the material should be spongy  which is contrary to last year  apparently. I presume it must have been not not spongy last year. So we need to emphasise the fancy design with on on our remote control above all else. And then also try and add in technological informat innovation which could be our sort of find the thing with a hand clap. And then we need to ma sort of make it easy to use that's as a third priority  so perhaps um fewer fewer buttons and functions as we've as we've discussed. And then maybe find a way to incorporate these trends so that we sort of capture people's imaginations. So maybe we could make the buttons shaped like fruit and veg  or the the buttons could be spongy  uh somehow. Maybe we could make them out of rubber rather than sort of hard plastic. And then sort of even wackier than that  we could maybe have a fruit or vegetable shaped remote  say in the shape of a banana or something like that. Right  so that'll be it. Maybe a banana or courgette or something. How how far we actually want to go along and sort of follow the trends  do we think the trends are particularly important for this type of gadget  or or you know  do they not matter that much? Yeah. Maybe yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah  I'm not Yeah. I'm not I'm not sure what what what the sort of timescale we're thinking of selling the product over is. I don't know. Yeah  yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That's possibly it. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah  I mean it's people say that it's the look  they want the fancy looking thing but I'm Yeah. I'm not convinced on whether having changeable covers would be something that people would buy into. I think with the mobiles  it's the  you know it's a communication device  people see you with it all about and i if it Yeah. I think Mm-hmm. Well  it was different last year. The trend was different last year apparently. It was not not spongy feel. But I don't know whether the trend will change. I don't know whether it's one of those things that like sort of having all fruit shaped keys  that that probably would go out of fashion very quickly  whereas just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less less of something that y you're gonna end up hating in a year  you know. Yeah. Mm. Okay. When you say d when you say double-curved  what what exactly does that mean? Okay. No you're not connected to me anymore. That should come up. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Right. That's what I was trying to work out. Shall we Yeah. Okay. Yeah I think that think that's a good idea. Rubber Rubber buttons and case. Yeah. Yeah yeah. Okay. And then are we going for sort of one button shaped like a fruit. Or veg. Don't know  maybe just Yeah. That's ru rubber buttons  yeah. Yeah. Reasonably spongy I guess  yeah. Yeah okay. Yeah. Apple? Yeah. Yeah. Apple apple a a qu Quite a big one  as well. A big apple. Uh Could be a red apple  yeah. Either  don't mind. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Looks like it. I think we all have a presentation again  so if we go through those and then um. Shall I go first again? I see this a little more smoothly than the last one. Okay right  let's get started. Um basically the uh for the Um I'll back actually. For the components design  um next step is basically the the way the remote's gonna work is still the same idea as before. We still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate. Then there is a chip and still the sender. So um yes including the power s supply as well. Um I'll go on to my findings in each of these areas. Uh first in the power supply  we have the option of just the standard battery  um. There's a dynamo. Any of you think of kind of like the the old torches which you wind up um. There's a kinetic option  which if any of you've seen those new watches which you kind of you power up by waving around  um it just requires a small amount of movement which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced. Um that's one option  but I think that was gonna cost a little more. And then there's solar cells. Um as a final option. For the buttons  we have um an integrated push button  which is Oh just to say all all these are um supplied by Real Reaction. So I guess for the ease of for quickness and ease we should take them from at least like one of these options. Um so for the buttons there's an integrated push button  which I guess is just the same as the standard ones. This says it's uh similar to uh the button on the mouse for a normal for like uh like modern computer. Um there's a scroll wheel which is you know the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down  which may be for the volume. You could do do that. Um one issue for the buttons is  depending on which material we use  if we use rubber buttons then it requires a rubber case  so we have to take that into consideration. Um moving on to the printed s Um that's on the next I th I think the there wasn't too much difference in the cost  that that related to the actual buttons  but it does affect the printed circuit board. Um which is the next section. Basically for the circuit board which is the middle  it's just see it down there the chips like the like the workings of the actual um of the remote. The firm supplies a simple  a regular and an advanced um circuit board. And there's different prices according to each. So if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons  that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard um push button. Um one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition. There's a small unit available through the company um which obviously would be an extra cost  but it wouldn't affect the size of the remote too much. Um and I guess that would require a more advanced circuit board  so there is an extra price in that sense. There is th sorry an extra cost in that sense. Um going to my personal preferences  um I thought possibly for power we could use kinetic um which is the idea of the watches um that you move you move the remote around to power it up. And this would avoid batteries running out  having to replace batteries and such like. Um for the buttons  I thought we'd probably get away with just having the standard um push buttons rather than the scroll wheel. Um and for the circuit board  again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote. So if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition  um then we'd have to get a a more costly circuit board. And that's it. Um i it kind of depends um if we're gonna have the speech recognition  we'd have to probably get an advanced one. I'm guessing. Uh but I don't know  so that is something I'll have to look into. Um that's a that's a decision for all of us. Um. Yeah yeah. We decide. Yeah. Um. Maybe w Um. Yes. Is there Um. We could do  yeah. Um yeah we should. As I say it only specified that we need a more advanced circuit board for the scroll wheel  it didn't The voice recognition came as a separate piece of information. Um. Yeah if if you down um. It's just this bit at the bottom which I've highlighted  but the scroll wheel requires a mini m minimally a regular chip  which is in the higher price range. Also the display's for something else which we decided against. Um but that bit And note that the push button just requires a simple chip  so that would keep the price down. 'Kay. So maybe just a simple push button  and that would cut costs on the Did everyone get this on the speech recognition? The um it was basically what we said before  the idea that you record in a set message  and then it picks up that message um and replies to you. So it is basically the concept we discussed before. Um but then we don't know for sure whether it would require a more complicated circuit board. I'm guessing it would  but got like the definite information. Maybe we should go on what we're certain of rather than Um if it's just the push button then it just needs the simple circuit board. So maybe that would be something separate  yeah. Okay  so we'd have a simple circuit board and that would be an extra that would be in addition to it. Oh that makes sense. Okay. Yeah that makes sense  so we'd stick with the simple circuit board and then think of the speech recognition as an extra an extra possibility. Okay. Um. Um yeah I I thought so just for just for ease of not having to replace the batteries. Um. It's um I think it works on the basis they have some kind of ball bearings inside. It's um it's some on watches which you you kind of you shake to power it up. Somehow the mechanism inside powers up through movement. So you'd you'd move the remote around a little bit and then that powers it up to use it. Uh yeah I think did we decide it didn't affect the circuit board  it just affected It was just Oh no th that's what that's what I thought  but maybe maybe it doesn't. Um I think I might have got that wrong. It's it's just an addition thing it's um yeah. 'Kay. 'Kay shall I pass on to you now? I assume it would cost extra  but Maybe we maybe we'll find out how much that does cost and have to decide slightly later. If you right click and then go onto a previous slide. Okay  right. Yeah  yeah. On the price  yeah. 'Kay. I guess I guess we're going for the biggest market  maybe not  but Was it was it specified that we went for the biggest? So maybe the children's remote should be like a a next step  but maybe I dunno for ours  maybe we should Yeah. So you also said for going for the international market um that some some maybe older people might not like the speech recognition. S s so um Yeah  yeah. It w it would make it quite complicated  where um ours at least keeps it fairly simple and then the Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes yes. So maybe we could have like Yeah. Yeah I I know what you mean. So maybe we could have volume written on the side and then up and down on the on the buttons themselves. Possible. Mm. Yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah we got it down to not too many. Um Are we are we gonna go through the design of all the buttons at the moment  or are we gonna t Yeah  maybe we should see yours first. 'Kay. Well I dunno I I guess maybe fruit and vegetables may be popular at the moment  but as we know how fickle the fashion markets are  maybe I mean it just seems realistic that the remote control market isn't the kind of thing which takes in those kinds of fashion trends. to something which is maybe more universal. We c maybe can imply a fruit shape possibly. Maybe the spongy feel is something we could think about  um. Maybe still with a rubber design we could Um. Oh yeah yeah one of the things were if you had rubber buttons then you had to have a rubber case. Um oh no no no sorry it's if you use the uh rubber double curved case then you must use rubber buttons. That's the way round. If you have the rubber case then you have to have the rubber buttons to go with it. Which makes sense. Um. Yeah. I suppose we maybe are limited in the fact that we still have to put the logo on the actual would or not. Yeah. Yes yes. Maybe we could think of the the cases like changing with the fashions like the Nokia phones where you could take the casing off the outside. But whether that would be too much to incorporate in production  whether that would just increase the costs  make it more complicated. Yeah the a the actual the sort of the look from the outside  so where the buttons would stay the same  and the general function of the remote would stay the same  but you could change the the way it looked. Yeah  that's true. Yeah. So it is a possibility  um. Oh okay yes that is Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And whether we'd have a big enough market to have this kind of like secondary market of selling the cases might be something to consider. Yeah. Yeah I suppose  where you you keep the remote hidden under the sofa most of the time. Yeah  less likely to So then th th that would Yeah. it seems to make sense that we we'd just maybe stick with the standard rubber case  and then have the standard rubber buttons as well. Um. Um. Mayb Maybe curves give it like the slightly more aesthetic feel? But the double curve wouldn't require us to perform miracles with the Plasticine. Mm-hmm. Yeah yeah. So shall we go through quickly and just work out what we've decide on  if we have to kind of 'Kay  so shall we quickly We'll go for single curve  yeah. Single curve. So did we did we decide on the kinetic power supply? The one you move around? Okay. Um Oh we ca Yeah yeah  we'll still have the Are we gonna go for the simple circuit board just to keep the cost down? I th I think we can by by not having anything too complicated. Um. Um. And see we could always decide against it if something comes up that's just something to that we seemed to leave out. Yeah  it was just 'Kay. We will go for the a a a apples apples. Okay. And then we're gonna are you gonna work on keeping the button design quite simple? Just like the Just working out what we're gonna do for the next time. Um. Yeah. 'Kay. And j yeah  just keeping the sort of the labelling them labelling of them fairly simple as well. Fairly sort of self explanatory. Okay. Is that the end? Okay. Okay. Right. Conceptual design meeting. Right. Okay  so Right well um from the last meeting I was trying to send you the minutes  but uh it didn't work out too well  so maybe in sort of um quick summary of the last uh meeting  I can quickly give you what we what we had. Uh right  so Wishing I hadn't closed the damn Right so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo uh the company logo in its uh colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device. We had uh made our decisions about uh made our decisions about uh the device itself  that it was gonna be simple to make it uh enable us to complete the project in time. We're gonna have uh effectively two pages  a front page which had the uh features that the uh the customers most wanted  and then the uh the backup features on the second page so that it could uh meet the technical requirements. And the customers wouldn't have to look at them too often  only as and when required. So. So basically what decisions uh have we uh made? Uh have there been any uh changes? Right. Three presentation  yeah. So Yeah  fine. Okay. Mm-hmm. What would be the cost do do we know? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. with the printed circuit boards you were going for the Mm-hmm. But are we going f R right. So are we able to make that decision now in a sense that this is the point at which we're discussing that issue  so would it not be best to rather than I mean one way is to do each of the presentations and then make decisions going back to the various presentations as they were. The other way would be to do the presentation and then make the decision at that point in time. 'Cause at that point then you've got the details up there  so if we wanted to know for instance that the scroll wheel required the regular and what required advance. Then if we were able to see that down then we could make the decision at that point in time and then that would be the end of that issue. Does that make sense? Mm-hmm. No the scroll wheel required the regular  so the Hmm. Okay. The display requires an advanced chip the display requires an advanced chip which in turn is more expense. Okay. Down. Right. Okay. So. So we're going for p Okay. So is um Simple push button. Mm-hmm. So if we go for the simple push button  so effectively we're going for the simple printed circuit board are we? Or are we going for the regular? Mm-mm. But is there any other I mean okay  that's true for the for for that element  but we have to take all el elements into consideration. And so if there is one element that requires the more expensive one  or say the regular one  or the more advanced  then that would have to be the same for all of them. S Right. Mm-hmm. No. Mm-mm. Okay. Simple circuit board. Simple push button. Okay. W w kinetic. You were you were wanting to go for the kinetic power supply. Mm-hmm. And how does it get uh charged up? Okay. Okay. So the speech recognition was Are we going for speech recognition? No? 'Cause that required the advanced I had speech recognition requires advanced req require Oh. So okay. Speech recognition you reckon then is s simple. And so we would want it in as an extra because it doesn't appear to cost too much. Would that be In fact  it wouldn't really cost anymore  would it? And then have to change all change everything at the last minute. Okay. S Sorry? Yeah  I've found that try and get it back. So you were saying the scroll buttons Mm-hmm. Well we're to go for the international market rather than a local market but that that wouldn't necessarily preclude The one thing that you can often do with products is you can uh make small modifications. So you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever  and then you could have additional features in you know like a You'd have model one  model two and model three  and therefore you can sub-divide your market up. But that's really where your field is. Anyway you could add on for an extra package  but on this basic one I'm reckoning that we're going for the basic model to be discussed here and that uh you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments. Is that So so what are we deciding to do here? Right. Mm-hmm. Uh the fi Yeah  the finder function rather than as a speech function to find your remote. Okay. Hmm. So you'd have a finder feature rather than a voice recognition feature. And you were talking Mm. And you were talking about scroll buttons? Okay. b Alright  so we're just gonna have the the rubber buttons  was that right? Okay. So not to be focused on. Good in in Flip it round in ninety degree a hundred and eighty degrees and have it up and down. An upside-down V_. So that would show that volume was going up  whereas the one underneath would see the volume going down. Right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. You could have volume up and volume Volume up  down and Like that. And 'cause the idea was to have limited um it was to have sizable amount of information on it. Limited number of buttons. 'Cause it was sixteen buttons  wasn't it that were Okay. You know yourself. Well you were just talking about you've got to be careful how you shape your buttons  'cause you're can mis-direct people. And I would've thought the functionality 'cause the people get cheesed off by things by having to read instructions et cetera  so. ... Okay. Now? Yeah. Stand-by button. No th that that incorporates the trend whilst at the same time not confusing people  if you're looking for functionality. But what are they gonna be next Yeah. What are they gonna be next year. But but th but okay but you you can incorporate the tr If y if you change all the buttons then you've got the problem that this year's fruit and veg  next year's uh I was gonna say animals or elephants or w whatever. That means you're constantly changing your production schedule  and you've gotta make different moulds and everything else  so that's not a good idea I would I would suggest. Well Ah d d But if Mm-hmm. Well. Yep. Was that in the sort of fashion sense that this Or was the spongy feel was that uh sort of fashion? It was  wasn't it? So the Mm-hmm. Rubber buttons require rubber case. Uh so  yeah. The m the main problem is how f how frequently do the fashions change? 'Cause in essence in the production you want things to stay you want to basically mint them out 'cause if you've got fashion changes and that you're incorporating  then it means that your stock is um is last year's stock and therefore you're selling it or having to sell it at a discounted rate which you wouldn't want to do. Whereas if you kept the product the same but you could have a difference from year to year  uh it seems to me that you could incorporate a fashion statement if you like  rather than changing the whole kit and caboodle. You're just changing one aspect like like the standby button or something like that  and especially 'cause then you could make it something that Well  you might be limited in space  that yes. Well you two are obviously gonna find that out fairly quickly when you move over to your kit modelling stage as to uh how much pl how much how much how pliable is Plasticine. Hmm. So you're talking there about uh changing changing the casing. Yeah you you could do a colour change  so therefore you would yeah yeah I mean that's effectively what they did with the with the mobile phones  was to have some in blue  some in red  some in rather than all in black or  you know  which four do you want  as long as it's black? But uh so Yes oh that's true uh that might no Well not necessarily  because you could have your company uh We're we're meant to be finishing up. You could have your company badge and logo. I mean a lot of um computers for instance like like on the one you've got there  it actually has a sort of um stick on badge so what you would al all you would really need  whether it  you know  whether the casing be w any colour  could be any colour  but that badge would then have to stick out on top of it so that uh in a sense  with a with a logo like that  because it's on a white background  the only colour that it might not stick out so well on would be a white casing. 'Cause you you know you're sort of you're badging it. And in fact a lot of companies get somebody else to make them and literally just badge them themselves with their own uh badge over the top. And in fact the way they've got that there even if you had that on a white  which is the predominant colour of the uh the Windows badge  you'd still be able to see it clearly from you know a white casing uh product. So. It's uh in in the house  isn't it  I suppose. So don't change case. Change case colour. And we're sort of saying no to that. Yeah. Sounds reasonable. If you're going for fashion trends like that they'll need t you'd have to have interchangeable cases so that you could or 'cause otherwise someone's gonna have to buy a complete new remote rather than just a case. Okay. One one thing to cons one thing to consider is that in some ways you want um by having a fairly standard case it means they can all fit together on top of each other therefore for storage purposes in shops and the like and it makes it easier that you can if you can store them up on top of each other. Whereas if you do um fancy things with it  you then gotta put it in a ca a a packaging box that that does that. And the cost of packaging could be quite important vis-a-vis the total cost of the product. So but No. Mm yep. Oh right. S so do you wanna go for curves  more curves? We're meant to be f we're meant to be finishing this meeting in about a minute or so. Okay  curved or double curved? So it's single curved. Yep. Yes. Yep. So we've got spongy feel buttons as well  have we? As well as or w or was that So it's rubber buttons  so it's not really spongy feel buttons  it's just rubber buttons. With a rubber case right? And the standby button is gonna be different. Okay so what what shape are we making the standby button? A apple. Oh oh Sorry? A red apple? Is it? Sorry what was that last thing again there? Right much option on that. I thought you were going for a single curve and Alright. Right  so shape of buttons simple. Okay. So that's that  I guess. We should now go away and get these things sorted out. I guess you two are on plasticine duty or whatever. Okay  so um. Okay. ,The Project Manager presented the final cost of the remote with the finalized list of components. The final cost was under the alotted budget; the Project Manager announced that the project could then continue with the current prototype. The Marketing Expert presented an evaluation of the prototype to the group. The group evaluated the prototype based on the requirements of users presented in the first meetings. The group decided that the prototype met enough of these goals to be able to market the product. The prototype was presented and the group discussed the look of the prototype. The Project Manager summarized the accomplishments of the meeting. 
Okay. Good morning everybody. Oh  everybody is not ready. Alright. Okay  let's go. So  we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about uh this new project we're going to tak to talk about in a few minutes. Um so I will be uh Sebastian the Project Manager. Um you are the Okay. Okay  very good. Thanks for being here. Um so let's have a look to the the agenda. So  we are going to go through this agenda uh and mainly first to uh to make to to be used to the tools uh available in this nice and smart meeting room we have here. Um then we'll go to uh the plans for project and have general discussions about it. So  the goal of this project is to uh developed a new remote control. Um it should be original  trendy  and also user friendly. As usual we will follow the the project method um that we are using in the in our company. It is in three step as you know. First the functional design. The second's a conceptual design  and then the detailed design. During each step uh of each design we wi you will work uh s separately  individually on uh your specific tasks and will m we will meet to um to discuss and take decisions about uh what you've you've you did and what uh we will do next. So first  we have to to train ourself with all the um the tools availables in the in this nice meeting room and uh particularly the the white board so uh we are going to go through the white board and take some um s some notes or do some drawings. So who want to start? Mister. You have one in mind? Okay. Th thank you. Very interesting. Guillermo you want to? It would be very funny for us. Oh. Okay. Thank you. Hemant. Poor elephant. Yes. We have to I have to catch you  sorry. We have to to go through the meeting. Thank you. Yeah we'll discuss a f a fly or do we'll do another meeting abo on elephants. So so another important part of the project is about money  uh and about so about finances. So we should target selling price of twenty-five Euro for this remote control and uh we have um which which would generate a profit of of um fifty million Euros  okay. And we should target the inter an international market. O this is the next topic we have to discuss exactly  so let's go to it. So um we should decide which kind of remote control we want to uh we want to uh we want to go. Should be should should it be um specific remote control to some specific device? Should it be a universal one? And uh etcetera. So um so I'm waiting for your for your inputs very quickly because we have only three three minutes to go. Okay. Okay I think this is more a job to our market person yeah. So it should be the topic of maybe of the next meeting just to to have an overview of this and uh in which direction we should go. So we need to close the meeting. Uh we'll have a new meeting soon and uh so the work every every of you ha have t d to do. So um you have to work on the on the working design  you have to uh work on the technical functions  and uh you have to work on us user requirements specs  alright? Um you will receive some information by emails  i as usual. Thanks for coming today. Thanks. Uh almost. Ready. I'm uh Michael. I'm the user interface designer. Ah well if no one else wants to  yeah. Okay so  want me to draw my favourite animal. Let's see. Well  I don't really have a favourite animal  but um uh I think I have one in mind  so uh I'm gonna about the uh spider because you can actually draw it pretty well in the corner of a white board. The spider has a spider lives in a web and uh it has eight legs  and uh it can move all about the web in two dimensions. Unless it's a three dimensional web which y they have sometimes. There are some spiders that live in like that have like uh kind of a a big ball of a of a web. And uh the other thing is some spiders can actually uh fly like uh they have uh they let out like uh a stream of like the web building material but it's it acts like a parachute so they can actually kind of go and find new uh build a new web somewhere else. So I think they did this in uh in Charlotte's Web that movie that little uh well it's actually a book first but uh um at the end all the the spiders kinda flew away. So  that's my animal. Maybe it's happy 'cause it just ate someone. So you don't like pink panthers? So is this uh an Indian or an African elephant  'cause you haven't drawn the ears? Okay. We can discuss that off-line. So could I just ask one question  um is this a stand-alone unit that we're gonna be selling? So it's gonna be you already have a T_V_ but you're buying an extra remote control for it or something? Okay  alright. Okay well  so  it seems the the first thing that they've kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wanna make  which seems to a kind of a little strange if we don't know what the the product is yet  but I guess if that's if that's the requirement that we need to to design the the product to actually fit that that price bracket so  I guess we're gonna need to find out what's actually you know  what people ar are willing to pay for um what kind of product they're expecting for twenty-five Euro because it seems quite a lot for a remote control  so it's Yeah. Okay. Alright. Good morning. And I am Hemant  the industrial designer. But don't you think it's very difficult to draw a panther? So bad I don't like it. Um sure. Oh yeah. Thanks. This lapel is coming out once in a while. It's not very strong. Okay. So  not the favourite animal  but I think I'll draw elephant. I'll try to draw elephant. It's a problem. Okay  thanks. Okay so  elephant goes like this  and then it has four feet. I don't know whether there's any dist there should be any distance or not  but I think this is the easiest. And then we have it's trunk. And yep something like this. An eye  cute. Yeah  so and sometimes they have a hump. It seems that uh elephants are pretty friendly and they they have one very important way a different way of walking. So when they walk  wherever they are going to put their first feet  the second feet will always be. When they'll come to that position the second  the third feet will be there. That's the way they walk. And that's very peculiar about them. None of the other animals walk like this. And they are very useful to human beings. At least few few hundred years ago when there was no means of transportations or something  or when they had to carry huge um loads from one place to another  elephants were very useful. And they are found in um usually the warm countries. And um they are the biggest terrestrial animal. That's what I know about them. So  that's what I wanted to tell about elephants. There are two kind of uh yeah  they are very different  Indian and African elephants. So Indian elephant is having one bump  I think  and the African have two. And then there's a difference in the trunk of the animals  these elephants who are Indian and So at some for some elephants it's the trunk is having one Do we have some message there? Wind up? Okay  some other time. Thank you. Thanks. Marketing person. Mm-hmm. Thanks. Hi I'm Guillermo. I'm the Marketing Expert. 'kay I dunno why  but when I was a child I I wanted to be a a panther not a pink panther  or maybe yes. Uh yeah yeah. Okay it's a friendly panther. Yeah maybe. Um. Actually  honestly I I I dunno what's what's his it's be behaviour  I dunno if if it's the male who who hunts or it's the female uh  I I I have watched that lions di didn't hunt it's the the female lions who who hunt  so but I like it because it's fast  and it's black as well  so it can he it can hide itself very easily and it's it's it looks like um powerful  strong  uh I dunno. I I watch a a film about a black panther when I was a child and I was in that age when everything was shocking me a lot. Okay. I like it. Yeah. ,The project manager had the team members re-introduce themselves and then briefed the team on his own duties and on the meeting agenda. The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the team discussed options for batteries and infra-red signals. The user interface designer discussed what features the remote was required to have and presented two existing products which were based on different concepts. The project manager then introduced some new requirements to bear in mind when designing the remote. The marketing expert presented research on consumer preferences on remotes in general and on voice recognition and the team discussed the option to have an ergonomically designed remote. The project manager briefed the team on the decisions made so far and the team discussed color options for the remote. 
Okay. Fine. The names? For for for my sur um Jens. Uh Damman. D_ A_ W_. Uh uh M_ M_. I mean M_. Double M_. Oh. Sorry. Okay. Okay. Mm. Uh Okay. Well my name is Jens Damman  but we're in a group  and I I will start it. Wait. Um I've used a marketing report on uh the site. Uh I think you've uh read it too. Uh and uh f and furthermore I uh surfed the o the other site. You didn't read it? Oh okay  I I was the only one who get it. Okay it was uh uh uh um um a report about uh an experiment with uh a lot of users. And uh they had a lot of findings in their report uh with statistical uh uh uh thing uh with statistical uh proof. So I um I had three pages with findings and sev a lot of uh a lot of findings. So we can use this uh to uh create our own remote control. Uh seventy five percent of the users find uh most remote controls ugly. Yeah  I think uh uh that's a lot  so we have to make a beautiful remote control. Uh eighty percent of users would spend when uh a remote control will l uh look fancy. I think this fits uh at the uh what what uh Michael said about uh older people. Older people will uh spend more money uh for uh something uh uh what's good. Because younger people are more critical uh about uh uh where they spend their money money at. Uh seventy five percent uh seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot. Well okay  that's uh normal. I think uh we we have to make uh good zap buttons. But that's one of our requirements. Yes  fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons. Um Martijn alr already said it. And uh maybe our uh fold open system is is a good one  but I don't think it's uh reachable. Yeah  the ten percent on the top  yeah. That that's a good one. Um uh page two. Remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room. That's exactly what we said about um maybe a home station for uh for it uh to uh recharge the batteries or something. Uh I thought mo maybe we could make a clap system  so when you clap your hands it will beep or something. Uh you must find it uh quickly. Okay  yeah. Yeah  we can uh combine that. Uh it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control. Uh I think we must t uh take a look at this. It's only uh th thirty four of the thirty four percent. But it's uh a tough one. Because if we make a ha whole new product  our own style  we we c uh this is so difficult  uh a difficulty I think. Uh next  remote controls are bad for R_S_I_. Yeah  but only if they zap a lot  and they watch over five hours T_V_ or something. I don't We we haven't Uh we mustn't look too much at uh the last point. Okay  last page. Uh the last uh experiment uh was about gadgets  like uh speech recognition. We didn't uh think about that already. And uh an L_C_D_ on the remote control. We already thought about that. Um uh they finally had a conclusion that younger people um uh under an age of f forty five are uh more interested in new features. And but they're more critical. And older people uh want to spend uh more money. But uh they uh they don't want to uh have a lot of uh new features  because they're in their old uh thinking way. And they want to keep the old uh things the old things. But y But you but you already said that the uh company was about uh forty plus uh clients? I I think we can speak  uh we can skip speech recognition uh directly  because it's not reachable for twenty five Euros. Um then I have my personal uh preference. Okay  that's not very good  because I thought about television  D_V_D_ player  stereo and V_C_R_. I had a question about. But it's already out of the question  this. Um my point is  well  I If we ma uh make a a remote uh control for only television  I think it's hard to uh sell it for twenty five Euros. But it's the exercise. Yeah  only only for television uh On the market you can now buy for twenty Euros a remote control for everything. And we only make it for television  so we mi mm we m must made it make it uh very special. Okay  I told about the home station. Uh it must be simple  because uh our the the elderly people uh needs to use it. And I I found a motto. And we put the fashion in electronics. And that's uh the motto we are uh referenced to uh for our uh our style. We we have to make a a new product. We have to be um Yeah. One of a kind  I think. The company is about our uh th th their own fashion  their own style. Yeah  to k to keep it simple when you Sorry I thought about it  yes. Okay  this was uh my presentation. I don't Yeah. You can ask some questions or something. Mm-hmm. Um Forward. No. Uh It gets some seconds. Yeah  it's it's no it's not a It's what Paul says. It's not a remote control uh uh that um uh makes the T_V_ um do one two. It's the T_V_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must uh type one or two. It's only for television now. No. Maybe we can give it out in different colours. You can choose blue or yellow or That's fa That's fancy. That's uh fashion. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah  that's active. I I think it's in the case that it's active. It's not uh I it's it's just uh the the Mm. Yeah. Empty. Yeah. An automatically search function for each television  or something. Uh I kno Oh  I have a modern one. And the modern one you you uh you type uh search  and the LED began to blink blink blink. And uh uh uh after uh a short time the television turns off. And then you know  oh it it's the right one. And you can stop it  and then it's okay. So you don't have to search for your television or your code. It uh search uh the pattern for itself. Yes. Changing the signal. Yeah  that's the right uh option. Uh if you if you use the buttons  uh both of them works. But one you can't see and one indicates that you use a button. Yeah. Yeah  and Mm I think it's unnecessary power uh you use then. Okay. But then have to be on the in the all uh remote control have to be LEDs. Everywhere in the r Is LEDs uh beneath the the buttons? Yeah  okay. It must be around it then. Yeah  then Yeah. Not not not not here  but here. Maybe uh Okay. Yeah  I uh Yeah. Maybe what Paul said  uh under the on the on the home station  uh a button to uh to call your uh remote control  that it beeps. Yeah  there must be sound in it. I dunno. Mm uh  twenty five Euros  I think we can make it. Bec Twelve and a half  okay. But but we only have to make it for television  and um we must have something special. So Uh. We have to give our customers some extras. No. Uh. Okay. Changes. Uh L_C_D_ doesn't work for uh twelve and a half Euros I think. Oh. Oh  I'm watching uh the channel one. Okay. No  it's not But uh some of you had uh something to read about um uh speech uh recognition. About you said one and the television turns on one. Is that reachable maybe? That's very That's fancy. That's cool. Twelve and you've got twelve. Only the numbers  only numbers. Uh furthermore nothing. But only the numbers  one to twenty or something. That should be cool. If it's possible  I dunno. I didn't read it. Uh if i if i I didn't have information about that. Ah that's a problem  but Uh only in English. Only in English I think. No  that Yeah  then th we have to think about that. But do do we do it? It's more if we if we do it. Yeah. Okay. Yeah  and uh and uh In uh indeed uh the languages are a difficult thing. Uh because we we have a lot of languages. Yeah. A uh someone says that uh give me one Coke  and the T_V_ turns uh to one. Yeah  it's not uh Okay  but th that becomes your f Uh uh because that's very hard for uh speech recognition. Mm-hmm. Okay  no speech recognition. Yeah. Yeah yeah  it it mustn't work all the time. It uh uh it have to work only when you use it. So if you No  if you use one button  it must turn uh on for twenty seconds  and then it must turn off. Oh yeah. A see-through. Mm  that's cool. But you have You had a lot of different buttons. No  I use te teletext every day  I think. Mm. Trendwatching. Okay. That's fine. Yo. Mm. Uh. Uh Martijn. What? Uh Abbing. A_ B_ B_ I_ N_ G_. I was a little short on time  but What? Uh Just Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think the main thing is the usability  that's where we can uh make it a special product. Yeah. Okay. Yeah  but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel. So you might as well remember the number. Or not? Yeah  okay. But um how can you remember what uh channel uh connects to what favourite button? Yeah? Yeah okay. But uh uh for a user to to remember  if I press that button it goes to that channel. Yeah  but isn't it hard to remember? Like favourite one and Mm as as hard as No  neither do I. Yeah  I dunno. Uh uh the p uh next and previous. Previous I know  but next channel? I don't thi Li like a web browser  so Oh  okay. But uh um there's also a button to uh go to the channel you've been before. Like a web browser back button. Yeah  okay. Yeah. Yeah  w wouldn't it be a problem to uh Because you h have to be fast enough. Maybe the elderly people Oh okay. Yeah. Yeah  but that's th mm Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I I think you ha really have to divide between functions you often use  like um uh m maybe uh switch channels and uh volume and k that kind of things  and uh the menu button. Because you n almost never use menu button. So Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Well  the working design. The method I used is uh search the web. Just the web page provided. Um Basically I'm I'm not very technical uh uh educated  but uh I could figure it out. Um basically what happens is you press a button  uh then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button  uh like a switch. And by closing that certain circuit  the chip knows uh what bu button is pressed. So like you press a one  that circuit is closed and uh Then the chip produces a pattern. Like a Morse code to uh And and sends that to the uh L_E_D_. That's the uh light emitting diode  I think. Um and the light emitting diode is uh producing infrared light. That's un uh invisible to the human eye. And uh transmit that uh to the T_V_. However it has also an uh a visible uh diode that's uh blinking red if you look in it. And that's uh another diode  I believe. Because infrared is not visible. So that's er uh do two different things but Yeah. I I think so. I I'm not sure if it's the same thing. Yeah. Yeah  when you press it. So Two? Yeah  I dunno. Ma on on most on most uh uh remote controls it's red. So So I know. I I think uh the batteries will be uh a little Yeah  okay. Uh maybe. Yeah. That it's working. That it's not not the batteries are low. Yeah  I know. Just to indicate it's working. And uh the receptor in the T_V_ senses the pattern. So we have to understand what patterns are used to  you know  to make it universal. So that it can be used with all the T_V_s. We have to really understand what patterns are used  so we can uh o On the Otherwise it won't work. No. I I uh The chip um uh is producing the pattern. So we have to make a chip that produces patterns to  y you know  to Yeah. That are working. Yeah  or I dunno how it's uh exactly how it works. It wasn't explained there. Yeah? Okay. Ah okay. Okay. Okay  yeah. So it uh We have to make a a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one. Because you have to Yeah. Uh okay. Well uh y you have this chip. That's uh when the circuit is closed  it produces the pattern. But uh ma basically for uh brands of T_V_ these patterns are different. So like when you press a one on one T_V_ it go go to one. And on the other T_V_ it won't work  basically. So uh basically what you have to do is uh get these patterns right. And uh by d uh that can be done by uh just uh cha yeah  changing this pattern all the time. And um What he's doing when he's configuring this pattern  this chip  uh is trying to switch off the television. And when it's uh switched off  you can push a button as uh it's working now  so And then he saves that setting and then um it's working. Okay. Well uh the components. Yeah  that's a bit technical  and I hadn't I w I was a little short on time. Um but I think I understand it. Um the energy source is uh the battery  basically. Um that's connecting to all the components. Because it has to be fed with energy. Okay. Uh the subcomponent is uh w I I think it is uh the button pressed. So basically when you press a button  a switch get closed. Um that's connecting to a chip. So the chip knows what button you pressed. And the chip sends out uh the pattern to the infrared bulb. I didn didn't put the description by this one. Th this is a normal bulb. So the normal flashing light. Yeah. Yeah  and this is a LED too. But this one is producing infrared light that's invisible. And this one is producing normal light. Yeah Yeah  presu Yeah yeah yeah. Because uh when you button press a button and it doesn't work  it can Basically if the battery is low  it won't work. So you have to indicate that it's Huh  that's a good idea. Hmm. Yeah  but mm like when you push it n n Yeah. You have your finger over the button. So you can see Yeah. Or or m maybe on top of the A green light is flashing or Yeah. There. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. We'll have enough power to Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. B maybe it's that that's a little too hard to make. Especially for that kind of money. Because it's i it has to be Yeah. Production cost is uh t uh twelve and a half. Yeah  okay. Yeah  okay. Yeah  the the personal preference  I didn't fill it out. Because I was short on time. But um Basically what we could do too is uh have a Bluetooth uh integration. Yeah? Okay. No  and I I think a lot of people use uh teletext  still use. Hmm. Oh. Mm. Yeah. That kinda changes the whole situation. Yeah. Mm ah I I don't y you'll use it often  because you can see on the television wh what channel you No. Yeah. I think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and popular. And uh then the usability is not that required  because the Like in the mobile phones  usability is not that good I think. I didn't read I didn't read any b Yeah. Yeah okay. I I know. Mm. Yeah  I don't know. Yeah. But it has to work. And and and does it have to work only in English  or in Dutch too or And and uh w Yeah? Yeah  it's probably my job to figure that out  but And and do you have to speak in in like in a thing or Yeah  I dunno. Yeah  I think so. And and Yeah  and also if if you have a good speech uh speech recognition  you can just throw the uh the remote away. Mm. Hmm. Mm. Yeah  okay. But Hmm yeah  T_V_ one. Yeah. Yeah  that's good. Mm  maybe it's a good idea. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah  but younger people I think um more often use the internet and elderly people often use teletext. So uh Hmm. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Paul Wiezer. Paul Wiezer. A_ E_ Z_ zee zee E_ R_. Uh. Yeah  same here. Uh let's see. Which one was mine? Good. Uh left. So Okay. Yeah  okay. Which one first? Okay. Functional requirements  yeah. No  I didn don't thing we got it. Yes. Uh. Maybe just a button on the home station. So remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station. Yeah. Yeah  but good usability  so you can use it. Unique. Yeah  I reckon Uh I think mm Uh Yeah. But uh we also have to stand out  'cause there are already  like you said  so many controls out that support lot of stuff. But we have to make sure that we're better usability  and stand out by just looks of it. So make it just a different colour or different shape  so Okay. Yeah well Uh. There it is. Okay. Technical functions design. Okay  well  so we have s mm uh broad audience. Isn't that isn't true anymore. But um we have elderly people  so we need to keep it simple. Uh the way I want to keep it simple is to use the sen uh standard. So standardised uh methods like uh on all uh remote controls. Not too full  like uh Jens already said  only ten percent is being used. Yeah  I have it on the next page. But yes uh basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff. Um so the options that we put on there should be easy to use  and 'cause you have more room then  and for elderly people big buttons. Uh an icon on it or text on it  so it's very clear what that buttons does. So it doesn't take much time to figure out uh how to use it. Um a way to find out uh what people use is maybe just to use uh questionnaires on the internet or just ask some random people  elderly people what they use  what they want on a remote control to find out. But there is already in a one done. Of functions I could think of. Uh volume  channels  the the basic according to. Just one two three etcetera. Uh text service options. Um basic on-off. And I found an uh Could I think of favourites? I always look up the same um pages on text and always have to click the number. But if you could make a new option  that you just have to press one button and you get on your No y Well it's It was just a thought. So I'm  I u I would find it handy  I think  when you just press one button and you get on six six six. Well uh what I was reading on the page. Uh a remote control just sends commands  basics commands to uh the television. So switch to channel six. So uh button six says says six. And if you make favourites  it can say six six six in a row. Just numbers. That can be in the in the Well if you said a favourite Well i Never? Oh. Oh are you? Okay now  m maybe not. No  maybe elderly people uh. Right. They don't like new features. So maybe not. Um well play  pause. I dunno if that's usable when Not anymore for T_V_. Right  on off. I dunno  miss Did I miss any other buttons  basic buttons? I couldn't think of any other  'specially not for T_V_. Is Just the channel um uh What I mean is uh Six seven eight or five. Um I dunno. I don't have Uh I did Yeah  I don't think you use that. Y only when you want to go to Yeah  just use uh when you wanna switch between channels all the time. Yeah  I think um f Especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons. So you have that uh Yeah  the ten plus button. Just uh one one pressing  or quickly after each other. To just keep it simple and standard uh features. Uh yeah mayb But I think that's in the T_V_ as well. That's how the uh the T_V_ T_V_ handles it. But you can have a button that says um two two st two stripes. So you have uh like a five seconds period to press those two buttons. So if you have a universal T_V_ controller  you needed one button that has two uh stripes. So we have a a period of  I dunno  five seconds to press those buttons  and that And not for elderly people to look  one two uh press and aim and So I I don't think so. Uh I just thought of another one. Most things in modern T_V_s are also on the menu. So you also need a menu button. And then uh navigation uh But we can integrate that with volume and previous and next  so you have four arrows. Yeah  okay  but um Yeah  a mute button. Yes. Don't think so. Yeah well  that's that's I think that's the layers that produce. Now I have to figure out what's uh what to put on. What we're gonna use. And later we can d uh do the design. Okay  uh now my personal preferences. Uh using the standards  basic Um I think that we should stand out uh unique  being unique with the design. So we have to  I dunno  uh make a different shape than usual. So when you are in the shop and you see our T_V_ controller hanging  that it stands out. Not just in in the row when you see all the same uh remote controls. Um I dunno. Different colours um Yeah. Well why not? Or Yeah. Well  maybe you can look at uh mobile phones. Oh. Who? They they're uh designed very well. And well basically are the same  just a bit smaller. You think you can't make a T_V_ controller too small  'cause then you will always lo always lose it. But uh well  I think that's a good example. Okay  sorry. Well uh Yeah  I I'm finished. I think we discussed everything. Uh j Is Ain't it just to to indicate that it's transmitting? So Yeah. Maybe uh Maybe depends on uh Yes. But maybe Well we don't have to make it red. Maybe integrate it in the design as well. Uh Oh  maybe it's it is would an e No. Just uh Oh. Yeah  but it doesn't have to be red. It's just to indicate something's on. Yeah. It's it's not very important  so yeah. So mm So we have to uh make buttons for that as well  to make it uh Okay. Well  I I use a universal uh remote control  and list of all the T_V_s you have  etcetera. And you have to put in a number  so it works on your T_V_. Okay  so we use that. Yep. No  y Yeah. No I don't think so  but Yeah  i it it will look different  and I think we need to find something else. Yeah. 'Cause otherwise we will just make another standard  and our uh motto also is Yeah  w around the buttons  or in the buttons even. Yeah  then then won't Then you won't see it. Yeah  we're thinking about it. Uh on a mobile phone  in the dark uh everything lights up. Why ain't that on a remote control? Yeah  if uh a mobile phone a phone can do it  it's Yeah  i if you're in the dark  you can't see the remote. No  I dunno. But if we use a battery station  which I think we will use Yep. And also it's Okay  it shouldn't take much Uh I th I think uh you also have uh remote controls with a lot of options. But we lose about ninety percent of those options. So I think you can uh Yeah. I think we will save money with that. Yeah. Okay  that's It changes things. Um Well yeah  then we have to make some nice features. I think uh the thing in the dark is a good way  to make it more like a mobile phone. More modern. That's important I think and And I d I don't don't think it's very usable in a remote control  especially when you only have T_V_ functions on it. So Yeah  I tho I think that's not usable. So  but uh Yeah. What other features can we put in? It's very fashion. Mm. Mm. Yeah  I think it's What But uh I dunno how that works then. Uh does your uh Does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever uh one to have in channel one? Yeah  I dunno. So  is it very usable? That's what I'm looking at. Is Mm Yeah well It's I d Yeah. I don't think it's uh useful enough to take the effort to design something with uh speech recognition. Yeah. Well yeah  that's the right command. And then you have to say uh T_V_ channel one  or something. Not just one  but Well I dunno. But I don't think  it just ain't useful enough. Yeah  I think so. Yep. Also the one in the dark. So uh It lights up when it's dark? I didn't Okay. Yeah  but um Yes  that's what I mean. Or maybe when you yeah. It lights up all. Okay yeah. D Yeah  alright. Yeah. Maybe just as an option  w like we discussed  like iPod. Different colours  uh maybe use even different fonts. Like uh phones. Yeah. Uh as an option maybe. It's the standard Yeah  uh Yeah  we but we don't We don't really have any complicated buttons. Yeah okay  but Yeah  well w I think the buttons are very easy. With just uh standard buttons we just have so little No  I don't need don't need Uh teletext options are only four buttons or something. I use teletext as well. Yeah yeah  one level. And I think  uh 'cause um we don't have that many buttons  I think the design is most important. You can d uh integrate the buttons in the design very much. 'Cause simple buttons. If you put one above it  it's clear. How long is lunch break? Okay. Bye. I just forgot their name  so uh you're i sorry  I just forgot them all. So I have to write it down. So Do you know them or Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  no  but your b your surname. W_O_ da. Okay. Okay. And what's your name? W_I_E_S_ z Z_ or S_? Uh uh zee. Okay. What's your name? Yeah  but your surname. Your surname. Okay  thanks. Yeah  me too  so that's not No no no  I just fi first my So let's have a look  we have forty minutes  so it's it's more than enough. Okay  perfect. So we have Oh no  what's that? So so we have uh forty minutes for this uh for this second meeting  and we have to make uh sure that we going t that we are sure  that we are  that we know what we're going to make uh th what the product is going to like look like. Uh first I have the notes of the last meeting  so I showed uh show them to you. Oh  sorry about that  I just escape this one. How do I escape this? How do I I escape this s uh presentation? Ah okay. And show  sorry. Okay  so let's have a look s at this one. Okay  so the f the f the points we had last meeting was the um Should be a univ uh universal remote control No  that's I uh s I just got a email from the from the personal coach and it should be a T_V_ remote control only. So have you changed that part? Um so yeah  it still has to be uh f a r a remote control for kids and elderly. It's it's still the same. Um All these points uh we have to look at. You all know them. But uh there's another point. The um uh the main uh people of interest of this company are forty plus people. So they're old and not younger people. So we have to look at that as well. 'Specially old people  maybe bi bigger buttons or something  I dunno. Uh so So yeah  that's it  so just you can do your presentation for uh Oh it doesn't matter  just start with the I I didn't read i read it  so it's not for me  I didn't get it uh anyway. It's only for you. Yeah. The last point is quite an interesting So if we Yeah. Yeah  we should have the ten percent on the on the top  then you're you're So we have uh a new uh age of forty plus. People. So yeah  so we just can skip the L_C_D_ r on the remote control  because Yeah. It's too Okay. Because it's too expensive. Yeah  probably. So it has to look uh uh uh unique  but Yeah. But old people are not looking for that. Not really. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. So Paul  you can do the next one if you want. It's on the on the uh net net uh thing  isn't it? So what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or Okay. Yeah. Okay. Maybe i maybe it's too complicated  but not sure. It's a good idea  but Uh Uh mayb for me it's If I use my telephone  I never use those buttons to to to call sh Never. So And If I don't do it  maybe old people It's not  it's still not It's not anymore n uh Just on the front as well. No  that's the only th the only thing you need. Just very simple. Uh Yeah  I know what it is  but I think it's all too difficult for old people. And how do you want to uh do it  like if you have a channel above ten? Normally you can press one  zero or A ten plus or Okay. But do we still need a two level remote control? Because if we only have that l only f No. Yeah. Maybe it's still still a good idea  I'm not sure. You'll also have to use a mute button to to Maybe  not I don't know where where you have to put it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. Yeah. Does it have to be Uh it has to be uh with different colours or It's like a iMac or something. Just to make it But it looks cheap as well  because it's a small thing. It's only twenty five Euros. It looks very cheap if you make it Oh  you just I dunno what happened. Yeah  we have to look at mobile phones  that's right. Just Yeah. Yeah. Okay  we hurry up a bit  because otherwise we won't make it. Is it fin Are you finished? Okay. So we we also have to have a LED li LED light on it? Yeah  it's I think it's usable. Yeah. Or just a green one  because it's If you use it  it's green or the red  it's r green. Yeah  that's right. But if you Red's l shows up like something's wrong  and green is like it's okay  you press the button. Yeah  I know. Okay  we make it red. You have to The whole the whole uh remote control becomes uh green if you press the buttons. Uh that's cool. No  we have a recharger in it  so If we can still make that then But it's cool if it was green. Green or red or whatever  it is cool. I just say Can you s just say it again  because I was just looking There's just a short Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So that's the LED  L_E_D_. Yeah  okay. So we can make the normal one also a normal light. Not a LED light  but as a normal one. To flash up your Yeah. Maybe you have to uh put uh a small light around the button you push. So you see green if you push that button. Yeah  but if you u if you do that  you know that you're uh sending a signal. And it's you also know which button you p Yeah  that's right. But it But does it make any difference for the energy you use? You got still one LED. That looks different  yeah. The same as a telephone  or a mobile phone  or what do you mean? If you push It lights up. Everything lights up. That's a good idea. It it only takes a l a little energy and it's not that much. It's f Yeah. Maybe that's a good idea for old people as well. It's only few LEDs. Only four or something. Four LED. Yeah  that's a good idea  okay. Everything agre Everyone agrees with that  or Okay. Yeah  and then you Okay  yeah. But you have to make a sound device in it then. But Yeah. Okay. Are you almost finished or just Okay. Okay. No worry. Yeah  I just want to talk some about some more. So maybe you have to Yeah? Okay. So this Oh  sorry. Wh what's that? So uh Oh  sorry. We have some new uh project requirements. We have to have a look what they are. They're still in um Uh teletext has become outdated since the popularity of internet. So a teletext option  maybe we have to skip that one. I'm not sure. I don't think so  but Yeah  and it's it's on your comp it's on your television. It's only one button. So I don't think it is We definitely should use it. Um Yeah  that's uh what I told you. The remote control should only be used for a television. So that's maybe easier. And um the the forty plus people  I already told you. Oh no  sorry. Oh  this is a problem. Oh sorry about that. The new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty. So it should be flashy or just more interesting. I'm sorry about that. I just I just didn't read it well. So does it make some decision about that? That still stays. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  maybe we have to integrate that as well. If it's possible. But I don't think it's very expensive actually. Why should it? You only have a microphone in it. Nah  maybe Maybe maybe it's too hard to uh to realise that. It We have short time to to put it on the market  so that We have to do a lot of testing before we can do that. We make uh make uh  we can make th th the new remote control very flashy. Yeah. Yeah. I think so. So we have to make some decisions. So you can see on the uh So we have to know what we're going to put on. Do we  do we make uh a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything? Do If you press something  it lights up for a few seconds  so you can see what other but buttons there are  okay? Okay  we just take that one. And what else  we have Yeah  but it's Oh th I thought would  that that would be the same. If you push something  it it all lights up. Or you can switch it on or something. Yeah  that's right. You have to Yeah  that's right. That's what I said. It's the same as the telephone. Yeah. And do we use a a Uh what's it called? Like a iMac  if you can look through it. Or just a normal remote control. Yeah. Different colours. Okay  so y you just make it th through You look through it? Okay. And so the buttons we have  this is  yeah  this is normal. We put in the the simple buttons on the top  and probably the the the more complicated buttons down there. Yeah  maybe you have you have to Uh when you use teletec teletext  you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one  or to go to the previous one. O but maybe you can put um the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control. Because you ne almost never use it. Yeah  that's right. Yeah. For me too  it is. So we just keep it one level then? Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So that's it for toda for We're going to have a lunch lunch break. Um So yeah  you know what you have to do. This is uh this is it. You get your meal and everything  so Yeah. So  we're finished for t for this time. We're going to have some lunch. Yeah. ,The project manager opens the meeting by stating the agenda. Then the industrial designer and interface specialist present the prototype  showing where they placed each button  function  and the company logo. Then they talk about the material they chose  which is light gray colored and light weight plastic so that people will want to buy covers. Next they take a brief look at the finance by examining the materials used  chip required  shape  and color. They are exactly on target at twelve point five. Next the marketing expert administers the product evaluation  and the group talks about whether the device is flashy and fashionable  technologically innovative  easy to use  suitable for the consumer  complicated  how long it would take to learn to use it  and its appeal to all age groups. They come up with an average of 1 for the evaluation. They briefly discuss the project process and agree that they worked well together  had excellent teamwork  and created an effective product that meets the budget cost. They close the meeting by thanking one another. 
Okay? Good afternoon. Hope you have good lunch. Oh. Nice. And you? Okay. So today is um our third meeting. It will be about the conceptual design uh. If I come back to uh the minutes of the last meetings um. We decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we are not decided about u the use of L_C_D_ screen on on the remote control because of costs. So maybe we cou wi will be able to clarify this this question to today. Uh at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point. So I hope uh that your respective pr presentations uh will help us. So each of you have some presentatio presentation to perform um who starts? So marketing. So you are you saved your y your presentation somewhere? So you're four? Which is trend watch. Okay. Mr Marketing Experts. So Mm-hmm. Next slide? Yeah. Okay. Mm. Drawings of bananas. Uh-huh. Well so this is in the next slide certainly. It's not? So maybe you maybe you can display a banana on the L_C_D_. Apple for channel one. Okay. That's a question. Maybe too long. A banana. Okay. Yeah and you you you will not have pla enough a lot of place to put a L_C_D_ on a banana also. Well  you're the Marketing Expert you should tell us if it is too much or not. So So you you you suggest to go f Okay. S so you're simply you're simply looking s to a remote control that looks like a banana with few buttons with only a few buttons. Okay good. So maybe you can go ahead? Okay. Thanks. Um. Okay  I'll give the floor. So you are User Interface guy. So you're three? And it's this one. Go for it. I there's something that I unclear really understanding. Is this a technology that recognize keywords speech keywords? And it's just to  it's just to playback something? Yeah yeah. So this is not s really to do to to do control. Yeah. This is just more like a poi pois yeah. Yeah yeah. So it it's c uh it it it is a uh uh easy uh a fancy thing that you you can bring to we can bring to the remote control that will not have any uh yeah comp completely pointless for the inter for from the interaction point of v point of view. Okay. Yeah yeah. So this is so this is this is much more than tak taking this technology  bringing it to the remote control and using it. So this is out of discussion. So if if if it is something that you can we can bring easily and to put it into the banana remote control No this is mm banana-bando  yeah. Uh then it could be cool yeah. Okay. Okay. It doesn't look like a banana at all. Yeah. But you you can fit i you're saying now you can fit it to Yeah. Mm. It's enough. Switch on. Yeah. Okay. So i it looks like we're going completely to forget about the L_C_D_ thing. I think that No we can we can't use that. We can't use that to to comman co communicate  it's just a thing No. Yeah. Yeah. A good good good thing. You want to g to move to your slides? You're finished? Yeah I think so. Mm-hmm. Mm. Exactly yeah. Oh  good idea. Very good. Okay  let's move on. So you're two? Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm but i but there is no elasticity which could be Yeah but the components inside. Yeah. Very too expensive to do. And also uh Yeah but it's more easier to do a banana in plastic than uh in wood. Well it look like it looks like you are all targeting that yeah? Yes it is. Yeah? Pumpkin. Green. Um um um  yes I see. Pep pepperoni. Poivron. Uh pepper. But um they do d Yeah. Yeah. It's not re it you you think it's really fancy and fun? You think that young people that are Yeah. More than a banana? Yeah. It's kind it's kind of it's more uh it's really ergonomic  it's fit in the hand and you've a lot of surface to to put the controls. Okay let's move on. So time is running  let's move on. Okay. S objects. Crazy objects. Okay. Okay  good. Bu it's it's. You s you you thing. Yeah. Mm-hmm. You think that yellow it's kitsch. If you make something that looks like a banana it should have the colour of a banana. O otherwise Roughly. Yeah. Okay. Let's move on. Uh uh yeah. Before before st before ending the meeting I'd like to to draw some sketch about the pro future prot prototype. Go for it. Well no  not not you  you can finish your slides before Mm okay. Okay. That's all? Okay  so mm so well done for the presentations. So we need to take some de decisions about um about what we're going to do. So I I propose that you go to the whiteboard and we're going to report all the ideas we had we had during this these presentations just to draw some sketch about what will be the prod final product and uh where Superman go banana and uh uh extra func functionalities such as wheels  um the speaker unit um well not in order not to lost the um the device  I do I don't remember you call it? Basis station  yeah. Uh so um so we're going for a stylish banana shape. Yeah  right. We I if it i if it has really the model shape of a bana you could the the starting is good but it could it should have more the shape of a banana if you want to point really a at the thing. If you don't want to to to do that movement which is which is difficult if you don't have to do it in fact  it's better. So ti time is running  we have to we have to we have to to move forward. So let's skip to uh this uh this this this idea. Yeah. So we have this. We have a a basis um  how do you call it? A base station. We'll have a base station extra uh on the side. Yeah. Uh  we have a R_F_ for um for beeping for beeping. We need b R_F_ to beep. So we that means we need a button on th on the on the basis. Basis station  thank you. Can you go quickly please? Okay. So we are going to add uh also um you as you suggested the whee some wheels to control the volumes and channels and your tur turbo turbo uh button. Yeah  on the th yeah  maybe here. And the and the wheel a a at the level of the thumb for instance. And and you have two wheels. Okay right. Good. So no L_C_D_. Okay great. Um. Very good. Yeah. Oh  just the switch  no f not for the T_V_ for the T_V_. Uh so you On the side. Twenty five. Yeah. So. Well. No. Time is running  we have to close the meeting in a few minutes. So  okay  the next step  you can come back to your seat. The next step is to go for to f is to go to uh to building a prototype  based on this  okay? So next meeting you guys have to prepare the followi things. You have to uh work on the look and feel uh design and you have to work on the user interface  in fact you two you have to work together to model the first uh f first prototype. Uh Marketing Expert uh have to go to product evaluation. Okay? It's too difficult. It's not a possi it will not be possible to implement it for the next prototype  so t it's in the next prototype so let's skip it. Yeah  maybe  for the n if if if it it works well  we'll go for uh an orange one. Yeah yeah  honour the fruit. Okay. Thanks very much. We'll see n next meeting. Bye. Thank you. Hi. Uh  yes  I had something similar but non-vegetarian. Yeah. What what do you mean by fruit and vegetables and spongy? What you mean clothe No  I missed that one. Oh  they're okay so they're not like dressed as a carrot they just have like pictures of fruit on  okay. So we're not gonna have a remote control in the shape of of a banana  just maybe Okay and So which fruit are you thinking of? Oh  so you want the remote control to be the shape of a fruit  or you want just some kind of like fruit logo on the So something that looks half like a fruit and half like an elephant. But okay  I'm not  I'm not really sure if uh that would really appeal to everyone though  maybe just to fashion gurus  like maybe just like a little bit n a little fruit picture somewhere in the corner  but I don't know about uh I dunno how ergonomic a  an orange is. To fruit? But is it uh is fruit cool? Is fruit cool? Well I guess  you know  Apple has the iPod so  imagi just 'cause they have an apple on their on their product  doesn't mean fruit is cool. Okay  but it has to be easy to uh to use though and to hold you know  you don't wanna pear or a watermelon. Well  probably the only thing is a banana that I can think of  a cucumber. I dunno. Maybe. Too green. So  but I mean you also have to you have to also have  fit r all the buttons and you know. It's  it The thing is you have t normally with um with buttons  they have to be at some point attached to a circuit board so if you're gonna have things like on a cylindrical kind of device it may be difficult to kind of to build. Yeah. Well  this is Okay. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Okay. So. S next uh slide. Okay. So I received an email um around lunchtime letting me know that the brilliant minds at our technology division had developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit  um which is a way for you to have a conversation with your coffee machine and or remote control. It's no  what it is  it's it's very It has a has a microphone  has a speaker  it's got a little chip and it allows you t Well  it's a sample sensor sample speaker. Sample sensor sample speaker. It means that it can recognize  it can do like a match on a on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back a phrase in response to that. But uh there's no kind of um understanding of the phrase. So  I mean  you know  I guess you could build that in  you could you could link the the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on on the remote control. But basically the thing is  we have this technology available in-house. So  um but the thing is obviously there's still gonna be a cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the c production of the components  so um it it but it basically means we c we can kind of consider this from uh you know uh a theoretical or usability kind of viewpoint without worrying too much about you know how to develop it because we have this already done. Whilst you know  some people might get annoyed if we uh if we just dump it  It's it it's no  well  it's it'll recognize uh I guess keywords  but you know keywords in a certain order like a phrase. You train it for a certain uh  for a certain phrase  you say the the example they said that they have uh up and running with their prototype is um well they've actually integrated into the into the the coffee machine that uh that we're producing is  you can say good morning to the coffee machine and it can recognize that phrase and it'll playback good morning  how would you like your coffee? Yeah. So actually that was a bad example  'cause it doesn't actually ask how do you want your coffee because it can't really understand the response  so. Only  like  only in the sense that it it can recognize a set a set target kind of word an It's designed it's designed as a fun kind of thing  but I guess you could use it as uh as a way to implement uh Completely pointless yeah. Yeah. Yeah  unless you know  you like having conversation with your remote control. Well yeah  that's the thing  if you can but you have to pro though I think it's a fairly simple design so you would have to record into the device every possible combination  you have to s tr train it to l to learn channel fifteen  that whole thing  not just the word channel and the word fifteen  it doesn't have that kind of logic in it. So Yeah  that would be some development work. Yeah. Banana-mando. Banana-man I uh I I I don't think it's worth it though  I think it doesn't really add much to the functional design and it's it's it's not mature enough to use as a speech recognition engine  so Um  yeah. So if we can just move on to the next slide  I've just done a quick mock-up of uh uh some of the features of our potential funky-looking uh remote control Well  you see  I was I was unaware at this point of th of the fruit focus  um  so at the moment it's more of a box focus. Yeah  well  this is actu this could be a genetically engineered fruit that's designed to be you know square so that it packs tighter in the boxes. But um  I've just indicated here  we could have actually two scroll wheels  'cause I think the scroll wheel is a fairly um key part of  you know  I think everyone has has agreed that it's that it could be quite a useful um thing  so. But I think it's important  you know  to have two scroll wheels because  you know  you want one for for the channel  but you also want one for for the volume  because it's it's the volume i it's  you know it's very handy for it to have uh instant kind of uh feedback uh and response  so. But um  I've also included this turbo button because I think  you know  every design should have a turbo button  and well so this is you know  a unique problem with with televisions is that if you have this scro this scroll wheel for the television  the uh the tuner on the T_V_ is not gonna be able to to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll  so you know  the th the person might want to have a uh Might want to be able to scroll past television stations without seeing what's on them  in which case it just waits until you stop scrolling and then  you know  displays that station. Or they might want to scroll and and have a quick glimpse of it  even if it lags behind what they're doing. Yeah  so with this turbo button you can  say  skip over t channels if uh  you know  if I'm if I'm going if I'm scrolling past them and you know  it's um  you could have a little red light that comes up when they press it so they feel you know it's really going fast or whatever. So yeah  that's um  those are the two important uh features I think we need on the remote  but I mean we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need  um. You know  i it could be  you know  if we if we wanna have like a very cheap kind of device  I mean  we could either consider that maybe we want to sell this as a very  if it's gonna be a banana  you know that's a pretty gimmicky kind of thing that doesn't have that much functionality  it's just you know a couple of scroll wheels and a button cause it's hard to get so many buttons on a banana and it's still very it may even be for most for some people more functional than their current remote  but if they have these scroll wheels  so  um you know  what other buttons do we want? I mean we could have well  I guess you need an on and off switch  but you could you could o you could turn it turn it on by taking the top off the banana maybe  you know  it's kind of like a spy kind of flick thing. That's why you're a marketing guru. Well  that's the thing  as have we decided that we can only spend  uh  twenty five Euro? Well not spend  but you know  charge twenty five Euro. But then you have to have a template for every channel  for a hundred channels  you have to be able to to recognize Mm. Well  I f I think it's probably more than  than our can handle because it's designed for a coffee machine  you know  to say hello in the morning. Well that's its current application  I would presume that it's kind of  they wouldn't design it to handle a hundred things th so. But uh Well I just I just made the point  I don't I don't know if that speech recognition is  you know  even if we can do it  I think it's not really appropriate for uh television environment. But um I did have one thing from a previous meeting  you were talking about um being able to find the remote control and I was talking about extendin being able to extend the remote control by having you know  a base station that can control other things as well. It might be useful to have some kind of base station  even if it's just you press on a button on it and uh and the remote control starts beeping  you know  this is a way of finding the remote. Y in that case maybe the maybe the speech recognition the speech thing could be useful just to say I'm here but uh it's probably a bit of overkill if you could just have a a beeping It's speech It's it's speech synthesis and s it's speech kind of  not really speech recognition  but kind of pattern matching  yeah yeah. I guess that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy. So  just one second  when you say double curve  what do you actually mean? You reckon you could like draw us a thing on the  on the whiteboard 'cause I'm not sure Okay  but like  kind of convex or concave? Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Although  you know  wood could be uh quite a stylish uh option  if you take like  nice quality kind of wood that's got a nice grain and you kind of put some  some varnish on. Well it depends  I mean  you have the outs the wood itself is not gonna break so you don't have to worry too much about the case being broken  it's the inside. Yeah but inside you know you could have you can still have some kind of cushioning that's not visible to the to the user. And I mean you could also  you can have just a very thin veneer of wood as well. That's true  but are we set on the banana idea? It's like a pumpkin or Green. What does it taste like? Ah yeah  is it what's it in French? Yeah  okay  so capsicum or pepper. Yeah. I don't know  it seems a little bit kind of bulky to me  like like with a banana you can have Well But like a banana you can you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel kind of on top and just roll it back and forth like that  but with uh I don't know how you would hold a capsicum and So is that  when you say speaker support  you mean it just has some output pinned which which which kind of Okay  but the speaker is actually attached to the to the chip in some way  or is just the the signal? Okay. Okay. So are there any issues where we place this this chip to make sure you can actually hear the the speaker from the outside of the banana? Okay. Yeah  but the speaker  if the speaker is actually on the chip  then if it's too far away from the the casing  or if the casing is too thick  then you may not hear the the speaker. Yeah. Yeah. So that's something we have to keep in mind with the actual physical design is to keep the the speaker close enough to the outside. Although  if It depends  if we like  if we are concentrating on like a fruit design  then maybe maybe we wanna sell a collection of fruit  you know  like a different fruit for each device. Cause that  you know  that sometimes people like to collect um you know things that of a similar type. Well  you're the one who wanted to do fruit in the first place. Like a power fruit. Yeah. Well I think that's a pretty handy feature. I think it's kind of people would find that worth it even if it wasn't uh a recharging station  even if they didn't have to buy extra batteries  you know. So Although you do need to include R_F_ kind of circuitry in the remote. Okay. I'm just wondering actually  'cause  you know  I this whole fruit thing with the banana  it's um it seemed like it first seems a bit kind of uh niche  like only a few people would really want a banana  but what if it was kind of uh a stylised banana? You know  rather than having it kind of you know yellow and really looking exactly like a banana  you could make it kind of silver. And um  you know to give you kind of the idea of a banana but without it looking you know completely kitsch. For better want of a better word you know? Well  you know  I don I don't know how many peop Well they Yeah  like this colour this colour Maybe  you know  maybe like still in the shape of a banana. No  exactly. Exactly. Um  but you know  just maybe maybe not exactly the same texture as a banana and just kind of  you know because the thing is it's gonna be a little bit difficult to make um to give like the texture of a banana anyway and to k to have the exact shape. I think if you're gonna not be able to do it properly you may as well do it in a stylised way that just looks a bit more kind of  you know  twenty first century rather than sixties or seventies. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah  so  I guess you wanna hold like the way the end of the banana you wanna kind of hold as ma you maybe wanna kinda hold like a gun rather than 'cause you don't want it to point kind of towards the floor. So you know  so if you have like Okay  so So okay  so I guess we need  you know  something that can fit a banana shaped object. Okay  so it's uh Yeah. Alright  so we need uh okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  which I think it's it's probably best actually on the on the underneath of the the device  so you have Yes. Yeah  so you have the thumb kind of here. So yeah  you need one one here and one on on the other side  so you got volume an and channel. And  uh No L_C_D_. Oh we need a we need a power um on off switch as well. Yeah. Yeah. Where? Okay. Well  I dunno if the traditional user is gonna buy a a banana remote in the first place  you know. Y I mean you need to kind of keep it um Yeah  how many of these did we wanna sell? I can't remember  what was Yeah  but how many units did we need to to sell? Four point four million. That's a lot of fruit. Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh. That can be the t That can be like the turbo banana plus plus commando. Okay. Yep. We have to go design the prototype. Okay . Yep. Four  yeah. Yeah that's me. Uh. Well I investigate the preference more d I investigate deeper the preference of the users. Uh so the the current investigation th uh th uh sorry the current the n current trends? Yeah? Okay. Okay. Well wha what I found um can you Yeah. Thank you. What I found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device. After they they want something new technologic technologically speaking  but the most what they what they find more more interesting  more or more important it's uh a fancy look and feel instead of uh instead of the current the current trend which was f the functional look and feel. So now more more cool aspect  ma more a cooler aspect uh rather than a device with many functions and many buttons with instead of i instead of ha of a device which can do many things  a device which is pleasant to to watch  to see. Uh also Well in in Euro in in Paris and and Milan the in Paris and in Paris and Milan the the current trend of uh of clothes  furniture and all this all this fashion it's it's fruit and the the the theme is fruit and vegetables. And also in the in the U_S_A_ the the current the mor the most popular feeling it's it's a spongy. Spongy means eponge? So maybe we should we should think in in this direction  so Fruit vegetables is the the new have you seen the last exposition of clothes in Milan? Yeah  I I didn't miss an I didn't miss and I saw that the fruit  there are many fr pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes. No no  not not yet  not yet. Yeah  yeah. So te textu textures  yeah. Yeah. Vegetable textures and all this kind. Uh yeah  yeah. Uh no no  it's not. It's And Um. I ha I haven't thought of any particular fruit  but the general aspect of the of the remote control may may could remind some kind of vegetable  some kind of instead of vegetable  some natur mm uh natural object or something. But yeah it it depends on the Yeah maybe the shape the shape No  not n not not too much focus  not too much focu not n not too s not too similar to a fruit because next year the ten the trend the trend will be different. So we shouldn't be at re really attached to to the trend but For instance  yeah. African or as an elephant? Well ma maybe we we should further specify what target are we focusing. I think in my opinion we should focus on on young people because they are more open to new devi new devices and also yeah according to the marketing report ninety p ninety five percent of young people was was was able to to buy a a n a cooler remote control. What? What? Yeah? Uh Is the new trend of the No I think we we should think about a a shape with it a device with a shape of some Yeah. Don don't you think we can find uh the shape of a fruit which is handy to use? Or m Maybe. Um Yeah. Yeah but I li I like your idea that we shouldn't have a lot of buttons b buttons so Uh do you want a an L_C_D_ with twenty five Euros? I think Well  according to the to the report people are more interested in in a fa fancy look and feel and in a technological inno in innovation  so  I will give more importance to the look and feel than rather than the new inputs and also it's I'm not convinced about this L_C_D_ because you need uh internet connection  you need more things  it's not just buying a new control re remote  you need buying control remote  buying uh more things. It's not so simple. For instance  yeah. Yeah for for for given an an example yeah. Yeah no  it's what I already said. Yeah but you can u Yeah but the can we use it for saying okay  channel fifty  channel twenty? M Mando. Banana-mando yeah. Looks like a tr look likes a a tro a tropical fruit. Yeah. What's a turbo button? It con it controls the speed? Yeah. So sounds crazy. I like crazy ideas. Yeah  of course. I I think we could use somehow the s coffee machine dialogue interface or so. You we can? We can't. Yeah  but we can say channel twenty five. No? It's not a lot one hundred templates  it's not Ah  it's designed for a cof okay. Is it design for a coffee machine? Okay. Yeah. Maybe you could ask your the you could ask the engineering department if we can Yeah. Yeah. Actually I was thinking that the the shape of a banana is not it's not really handy. Uh I don't know the name o o in English uh This it's not a fruit it's a vegetable. Green. And you put in the salad. Um Oui c'est ca Pepper. And it's al it also suits with the double curve for easy of No  I mean in a I'm sure it's fun. But banana is not so handy  I think that's handier. Yeah you're right. I think that would be funny at the beginning but after one month you will be tired of be surrounded of fruits. No but I think just one fruit to control everything. A power fr a power M a Mando  a Supermando fruit. Actually I I didn't understand very well this trace speaker lost control. So you you have to buy two things  the banana and the basis station. Yeah. Yeah but I'm a bit worried about the budget. Yeah. No  I I Maybe li like that. What about what about this shape? More or less. Yeah  but how many buttons do we need? What a What about Four millions? What about a I wo what about adding the this word spotting  keyword spotting recognition saying volume up volume down? It's too difficult but people like innovation and that's really uh innovative and I don't know if it would cost a lot  just a few five words. Okay. Plus plus  okay. Maybe objective banana? Thank you. Afternoon. Yeah  we had falafel. Mm-hmm. Spongy means it it's like sp But what's your suggestion how we can have some shape like that on the remote? Mm-hmm. Means buttons are in the shape of fruits  buttons are in the frape shape of fruits or something  apple  banana  something like that. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That we can discuss afterwards. Banana. Mm-hmm. I don't th it will be rolling a lot. But it's just a speaker right? It's not a microphone. Mm-hmm. Actually I'm not reading microphone there  so that's why you can all have conversation  it just to speak to you. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm  mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm  mm-hmm  mm-hmm. In-house. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm  mm-hmm. Mm-hmm  mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah okay  let's go ahead. Stable thing  that's right. To have  mm-hmm  mm-hmm. Mm-hmm  mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Communicate. It's one way. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah  that's right  yeah. So it's a speech synthesis kind of thing  something has been uh stored and it's just uh spoken out. Mm-hmm. Yeah. That's right. That's right. So this is going to be about the component design. So first thing is we need power source for the remote control. So I was of the idea that we can have two kind of power supplies  one is the usual batteries which are there  they could be chargeable batteries if there's a basis station kind of thing and on top of that we can have solar cells  when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so it'll be pretty uh innovative kind. Then uh we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your if the remote control falls it's not broken directly into pieces  there should be some flexibility in t Yeah. So there should we should think of something like that and then it should be double curve. The s science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve. Then controls for the traditionals u traditional users we can have the push buttons so that they don't feel that it's an alien thing for them. Double curve is  you have curves on both the sides if I'm right. So it's symmetrical kind of thing  whatever it is. So  it could be curve  so it could be convex  conve concave  depending on what what we want. So there are flats  there are single curve and there are double curves. These are the three things  and there are different materials  with plastic you can have double curve but with uh certain other materials we cannot have double curve. So there there was uh there were many other materials like wood  titanium and all those things  but plastic is I think is the most appropriate one  it'll bring the cost down and anyway it's Wooden cases Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Is it an e apple which has Banana is more handier as compared to this I think  and to capsicum. Okay  so push buttons for the traditional users so that they don't feel they are alienated  just and a scroll button with push technology for channel selection  volume control and teletext browsing. These are the three scroll buttons which are already available with us in the company and we we can go ahead with that. Yeah  we can go to the next slide. Then uh there are different kind of chips  one one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an adva advanced chip. So we can have regular chip for control. Pricing is a factor for us  that's why we'll go for the regular chip. And uh regular chip supports speaker support  so this functionality could be used for tracing the mobile phone which has been misplaced. It could be a beep kind of thing. Yes  yes  that's right  it's it's onto the chip  most most probably  not not hundred per cent sure about that. That will be the volume control I think which which a user shou it it should be already pre-defined. It should be whatever will be the case  the chip is always going to be sitting inside. Mm-hmm. Uh  so we can have it at one of the boundaries so that things are slightly better. As or as hearing is concerned  we can have some gap at some place  so that That's right. Okay. Yeah. So these these were the component selection and these things. We can go to the next slide. And uh these were the findings which I I saw with the web web  that user wants to have control more than one device wants to control more than one device from the same remote control  so our T_V_ remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like V_C_R_ D_V_D_ players which are usually attached with the T_V_  because users are like this and they don't want to have one remote control for everything  so with this additional little  we might be having slightly better market for us. Mm. Of fruits. Mm-hmm. Remotes objects  okay. And uh as well as I could see on the web the scroll button is becoming really uh hot thing s and we should have it on the remote. So you're having a basis station. Okay. Your usually your remote sits on that. So you and it's that's why it can have chargeable batteries. Now let's say Basis station is with the thing. It's like a telephone handset is there and the basis station for the telephone hand set is there. So now what user gets additionally he doesn't have to buy batteries  they're rechargeable batteries  so over the period of cor time he'll recover the cost. So you're having the basis station and there is a button  if you press that button wherever the remote it'll start beeping so you know where the remote is. Uh Mm-hmm  mm-hmm  mm-hmm  mm-hmm. Uh this is basis station is nothing more  just it's a wire which is coming from the main cable and uh you're having one socket on which the thing sits. That's right. But all these things are usually in-house so we don't have much problems. So component cost is going to be the least. Anyway  we are not using really advanced technology  L_C_D_ has already been ruled out  A_S_R_ has been ruled out. So it's the basic thing but very trendy and very user-friendly. And Mm-hmm. A yeah  otherwise it'll be mis means you don't get b any feeling then. It's neither a banana nor a And uh going to the last slide. Okay. Okay. Okay  so. Anyway  users'll be so the findings is users'll be very interested in our locator device to find their misplaced remotes. So that was very I thought it's a very good suggestion by everybody. That's it. Yep. Mm-hmm. That's right. The basis station. That's right. There's less space on this to put with the buttons. Uh what about a The base station. Right. Mm-hmm. Yeah. That's right  yeah  we need that  yeah. Basis station. Yeah  yeah. Turbo button. Okay. Uh for the remote? Remotes don't have power on off switch. Okay. S no  that'll be controlled by the those buttons'll be there already  yeah. Means on the remote. Because remote is going to have both the interfaces  scroll as well as buttons. They are not going to cost you much  everything is in-house and now you don't want the traditional users to be apprehensive of this. Oh  yeah. That's that's another issue which I didn't think of. But you know our targets are very high  means fifty million Euros is the profit which we want make. Twenty five. Twelve point five is the profit on one. Uh forty th four. Point point four million? Point four million. In the market. Mm-hmm. For the future prototypes. So meeting's over? Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you. The problem is after all this meeting there is ,The Project Manager reviewed the minutes from the last meeting. The Industrial Designer discussed options for each of the internal components. He showed that the size of the chip was dependent on the type and number of additional features used. The group discussed incorporating speech recognition and other functions to be able to decide on chip size. They decided that using speech recognition for the locator function only would allow them to use a simple chip. The User Interface Designer presented several existing products. She presented a specialized children's remote; the group decided to focus on a basic remote that would appeal to a wide market. She expressed that buttons are often ambiguously shaped and that their remote must have an easy-to-use interface. The Marketing Expert presented trends in the remote control market and the fruit and vegetable and spongy material trends in fashion. The group discussed ways to incorporate these trends. They decided to make the standby button shaped like an apple  to use a rubber case and buttons  and to use a single-curved shape. The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to construct the prototype. 
Good morning. Well  I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and uh Yeah  from the account manager. Yeah. Yeah  I think so. I think our uh responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager. Uh No  I'm doing the interface. Yeah I I'm I'm Well  maybe we have okay so I industrial design. It was a little confusion about my uh but it's alright. Yeah. User. Well  I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done and what are your ideas about the Well  w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess. So we have to plan how how it would be developed and uh how we can make it work. Yeah  I dunno I Yeah. Well I I think that Norman and I would think about um the technical points and um we should discuss it in the next meeting  or Yeah. Well  you have to make it work. That's the that's the big thing. Yeah. We can think about an interface with uh well Yeah  yeah. I I think if you want t to choose uh from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use uh w uh I dunno Yeah. Yeah. On the content. Yeah  yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea but I I think that technically it would be um a little bit uh uh more tricky to to achieve this than just to Yeah yeah. Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to uh navigate uh through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way  so Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen and just uh with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f Yeah  yeah. So I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff Oh right so Please  Norman  draw uh Okay. Yeah  by content or by channel  it's a good idea. And uh we we have to find a way how to gather information about the contents. Yeah. I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so I think that's the the things to do and uh to uh reflect about it and uh discuss it in the next meeting. Okay. Thank you everybody. Okay. Good morning. Or you can put it in the shared folder. No  I didn't get it. This one. No. No . I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information. Yeah I think assign your uh roles. For each person  yeah. Uh  I'm into marketing. yeah nothing much in the project. Marketing in this design. A design is basically for industrial design and the user interface. Yeah  this is. Yeah  that's right  first. us user define. There's a trend watching. Yeah. I mean working remotes we already have. This will be something different from the other remotes remote controls. Yeah  that's right. I'm a okay. I mean the main uh function of remote control is to have something in the hand and we should be very careful about the size of the remote control. If we are going to add a speech interface  I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it. And I could talk to the T_V_ television itself. I need not have an I mean we have some or something  different technology but Mm-hmm  yeah. And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of So  I mean  if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark uh some dark scene  the lights adapt themself. The lighting in the room changes. I mean  we have a option in the remote control. If we want to have that option  you press that button in the remote. Oh  I'm afraid you forgot to put your lapel. The lapel. Yeah  that one. Just plug it. Yeah  that's right. Hmm. Good morning. Mm. B did you send us an email about this? Yeah  we we received an email about this uh d designs. Ah it's Okay. Yeah  you see the email? You email. The v very no  no the first one. It's inside. No  no. The third one. Oh  you didn't get anything. It's strange. Mm. I got an email about the dis about the discussion. Yeah. I dunno from who. From the account manager. You have received the same email  right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  so each of us has a role to do. In each We already have our role. 'Kay  we can So there are three kinds of designs  that's all. Okay  alright. Yeah  yeah. I'm doing the interface. Are you using the you are doing the in Ah Okay. Mm? Um working on i. User interface. Yes. You see the second mail? Yeah  it's inside. Go down. Appendix. See there's a role for everybody. Even for the marketing. But look at your role  your marketing role. Yeah  that's your role. Mm. Yes. Mm-hmm. Need to collect information. Um. I I'm part of design  perhaps. Uh  what is most important in a in a remote control? What is the most important function aspect? Uh. That's alright. Yeah  it should be easy to work with. Yeah. Uh. We maybe you can have a speech uh recognition interface. You just tell the television I want which channel. Or or you can say for example  um I want uh to list all the programme tonight. Y you know  instead of uh remote control it's doing the some searching for you  so you don't have to look for the channel you want. Just say maybe I just want to press I wanna have a button for all the movies tonight. Or a button for all the magazines  all the information documentary tonight. And then you list a few  and I will choose from the list. So instead of pressing the channel number  I am choosing the programmes directly. Yeah  that's one way of uh making it useful. No  because no  it's not very a lot. Th this information exists. For example you can get um You can use uh well for example anything. The the idea of using speech to reduce the button  but uh and it's more natural. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes  possible. Yeah. But Yeah. Yeah  yeah. But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that um there should be a function  instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel  there's a option you can choose  either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme. So it's more powerful. Yeah. No. No  because you see now all the T_V_ programmes are available on the webs. They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format. We don't care. We just say that this are some content. We just want to retrieve the content and then classi sort them by the types of programmes. Some of the websites they already provide this service  so we can just use the service available. Download it uh to the to this remote control. And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories  or sev seven. The most there are only seven buttons. So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button  for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want  so you don't have to choose among hundred channels  if you have hundred channels  you just have six buttons  seven buttons. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Ah  yes. So. Yeah. Yeah  so you don't have to display here  just display on the T_V_ screen  right? Good idea. Okay. I think I think that will be revol revolutionary. Because all the T_V_ uh the the remote control have all numbers  lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end. Yeah. Alright. Okay. Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board. Five minutes. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  but we are designing just remote control. Okay. Okay  do you want to have a conceptual remote control there  or you just want to put the function in? Go on  draw something. Mm. Where is it? Ah  okay. Where where is it? Here. Mm. Mm. Okay  alright. So so the most functional des mm the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content. Right? We agree on that  right? Uh  uh first one is to uh buttons i or it could be anything with buttons. Uh to choose uh content s or channels. So we have both. The user can choose w which one they want  right? By content or by channel. Choose by contents or by channels. So And then what did we say just now? Other than this. Okay  so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content. Challenge. Okay. Content. Okay  so these we have to work it out. So this one of the problem. And uh The main thing. Okay. Alright. Alright  okay. So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting  so for now we get uh the funct this is the functional designer? That's the first aspect. Right. We will get information and then we'll come back in.. Yeah  we'll come. Alright. Alright  okay. Thank you  mis Good morning everybody. So  we are asked to to make uh uh a new remote control for television. And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly. So people can can use it without any any problem.. I don't know. Uh  not yet  but if you want Do you want do you want me to send you a mail? Or Uh. You get email . S For each for each one. So there are so we have three f yeah. We have functional design  conceptual design  and detail design. So  who will be the the responsible for the functional design? Any any volunteer? You are doing th. Okay  I'll for industrial design. Okay. And and you Norman? And And doing the marketing. Nothing related here to the Next. I don't know. I. About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later  no? Mm-hmm. What we we have to keep in mind the these characteristics. And of course it should not be very costly. So About the about what? You mean the external or Yeah of g of course. Yeah. You won't I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly. S Like s uh you you you say we can use speech. In the hand. Yeah. Except if if you are far from the T_V_. This is it's Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah we should also optimise the the number of buttons. This is good idea. So we have five minutes to Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so  can we S You it. Yeah. If if you you you can if you want you can use th the. Or before the before the the design that says. Norman. Be before before writing you can uh sit and that says what we what we said then after that you can you can use the. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Mm. Okay. So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes? And we'll discuss the other other aspects. Okay. Well thank you all. ,The project manager briefed the team on some new requirements to consider when designing the remote. The user interface designer presented two existing products and discussed what was wrong with each product. The team discussed how to create a remote which did not include the problems present in the existing products presented by the interface specialist. The marketing expert presented consumer preferences and requirements and the team discussed who their target demographic should be and whether to include speech recognition in their product. The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the team discussed various options for components and energy sources. The team then discussed features to include in the remote and what they could do to figure out how to categorize them. 
Okay. Oh  that's not gonna work. Oh  alright. Okay. Okay. Um alright. I'll just put that there. Uh as you all know we're here to create a brand new fantastic remote. Uh I'm Nick Debusk  I'm the Project Manager. Uh we'll just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you're doing  what your what your role is um. Go ahead. 'Kay. Okay. Um so we've got our opening  our our agenda is the opening  uh acquaintance which we've kinda done. Uh tool training  project plan discussion and then closing. Uh grand total of twenty five minutes we have here. Um so we are putting together a new remote control. Um we want it to be something original. Um of course we're a not only a electronics company but a fashion um conscious electronics company  so we want it to be trendy um and we want it to be easy to use. Um we've got the functional design  conceptual design and detailed design um which basically is is the three of you um. And w uh well um functional design um. Um do we have um any ideas of of maybe d let's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have  and then we can go into how we're gonna design it and and how we're gonna do the detailing on it. So we want it to be um a T_V_ remote or I I mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote? 'Kay. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. I I think yeah  yeah  r universal remote. Um this is my first uh go-round with creating a remote control  so I think we're all in the same boat here. Um Okay. So we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a uh like a tracking device or or like a a It makes a noise  there's a button on the T_V_ that you press and 'Kay. Yeah. Do we want so they're kinda like long and rectangular. Do we want something crazy? You know  we want something new that's gonna stand out. A m a modern so our remote should be 'Kay. Um. Okay so yeah  so we want it to be sturdy  we want it to to hold up to somebody's child  you know  throwing it across the room or  as you said  people kinda throw it  so ball-shaped  uh you know  if it were ball-shaped maybe  then it 'Kay. Um so we want it to be modern  fun  sturdy  um So our form and our function. Um we want it to be um easy to find. Um What else it what else do we want it to to do? So we want it to be universal. It's something that we're supposed to sell for about twenty five Euros um and you know  goals for profits are I think somewhere around uh fifty million Euros  what they wanna make on it  so. 'Kay. So marketing  you know  how maybe uh marketing  you could s find out what is the most universally um appealing remote control out there. 'Kay. Um Do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like? Maybe we could draw it up on the on the board over there. Some ideas? We want it to be a b a ball  you know  we'll draw up we'll draw up the ball and maybe th um where the buttons are located. Uh-huh. How would we go about um making you know getting rid of our weak points? What I mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball? Not to put you on the spot  but What did you say your title was again? You're the the Industrial Designer. Okay. Yeah. It's not new  it's not innovative  it's you know  everybody does long remote because it's easy  it's it's stable um. So if no  go ahead. Something with a grip. Yeah. Because even I suppose even with the ball it's it might not be the easiest to hold onto um. So perhaps the the joystick the the keyboard idea might work better. But then again  people like to use one hand to flip and one hand to hold their soda  so maybe maybe we I feel like I'm just shooting everything down here. Uh um Yeah. Okay  so unfortunately we've got about five minutes here to come up with our um remote control idea and start rolling with it. Um we've talked about our experiences with remote control and um we've got a couple ideas um. Let's see here. What if we had what if we had not only um say we went with the ball the ball function um  but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s um to make it easier to hold on to. So you know um s so it's easier to hold onto that way. Course that'll then remove some of our our ball. Unless this unless this part were raised  so say the cover flips over and covers that part. So the grip is No  that wouldn't work either um. But if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom  then that eliminates our ball anyways. So if it were flat on the bottom and then had the sorta grips on the side here I guess  um and then flat uh And then we have the problem with the hinge. So if we're flat on the bottom  it's not gonna roll away  it'll stay where we want. Mm  that's true. So we don't have it flip open. We just have a ball Okay  so then we forget the ball. It looks cool  but it's really not it's not functional um. So we've got our sort of keyboard kind. What if we flipped it around here  so that it were um Sorry  that doesn't look anything like what you had there. Um so it's up and down  you hold it this way. Course then it's it's like the rectangular again  only with a couple of jutting out points. But it's one-handed um. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  because it doesn't have a cord  like joysticks do. Is it possible to have it to where it would work with a like a sensor on either side? So that either way you're pointing it it would work. More expensive and yeah. 'Kay. Um True. 'Kay. Are we out of time? Okay  well  just to finish up  should we s go with this plan  start making some Are good ideas  what are not. Uh. Must finish now  so. And then marketing will look and see what uh what people want. Okay. And Project Manager will design a better meeting for next time around  be a little bit more prepared. And uh alright  good meeting. Uh  uh  um. Okay. I am Corinne Whiting and I will be the Marketing Expert and in each of the three phases I will have a different role. In the function design phase I will be talking about user requirement specification  and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled  and I'll be doing research to figure this out. In the conceptual design phase I will be dealing with trend watching and I'll be doing marketing research on the web. And then finally in the um detailed design phase I will be doing product evaluation and so I will be collecting the requirements and ranking all the requirements to see how we did. Mm. Huh. Ours too. Mm. Ch Like a tracking device? Mm. Be good. Lot more modern. Maybe like user-friendly  like a little you know  where you can use both hands  like a little keyboard type thing. Mm. Mm. Mm. Also since we're partners of the International Remote Control Association  maybe we wanna make it something that would globally appeal. That's more on the research end  but the marketing. Yeah. And maybe as far as design goes  maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences  'cause maybe one won't apply to all of the countries we're targeting. Futuristic. Mm-hmm. 'Kay  I'll draw something. What? My idea was just to have it be kind of like a keyboard type shape  you know  like video games l so. But maybe I mean that would be kinda big and bulky. We could also try to do the hinge thing  so it could like flip out that way. I don't know. That's my idea. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. True. Mm. That's fine. You're the boss  you're allowed to. Yeah. Looks cool though. Yeah. Mm. Right. Yeah. Sorry to interrupt  but we have a warning to finish. Yeah. Mm. Great. Hiya  I'm Ryan. Um I'm the User Interface Designer. Um likewise I've three different roles for each stage of design. Um the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of a remote control. Um in the concept design  the user interface  how the user reacts with the the product. And the detailed design um sort of like the user interface design  what they might be looking for  uh things like fashions  what makes wha how we're gonna make it special. That's about it. Yeah. Yeah. Well uh s function of remote control is just just you know  change channels is its main function. Oh right. I suppose you c try make it a universal remote for could work on all sort of electrical products in in one person's house. But  you know  they all sorta have the same role changing channels  volumes and then programming. I think they all work on the same prin principle as well sorta like I don't actually know. But is it just infra-red? Is that standard? Ye yeah. Um one thing I thought of with the remote control is you always lose 'em. So if there's a g a way of finding it quite easily  I thought that'd be quite good quite a good feature. Oh you can get those key well you could whistle or make a noise and it'd beep. Yeah. Generally  all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance. Just long. Yeah. Black usually. Yeah. I think so. Maybe sorta spherical or something. A ball. Yeah. People I thought maybe  because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another if it was in a ball  and maybe the actual controls are inside or something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It could be cased on the outside and t everything could be inside. Ye Small. I'd I could draw sorta the ball idea. My original idea was just simply sort of a sphere  where maybe you this is where it's connected together  and then when you open it out  it could fol it could be maybe flip  like a flip phone  and then when you fold it out the middle Maybe a hinge that'll have to be the strongest part of it. If that if we did use a hinge  or if it was just two parts  and then you'd have just sorta you you you know  your buttons. Thing is inside I think  sometimes remotes have too many buttons  so maybe as simple as possible  um as few buttons inside as possible. Um  I dunno  what's the idea for. Just something maybe if you ha if it had like if some kind of like light or something or lights around it. It's looking a bit like something out of Star Wars at the moment though  to be fair. But yeah. That was that was a sorta simple idea I had and then you know you could about Right  it would almost be like a ball. So that was just just an idea I had. I don't know whether anybody else has other ideas? Yeah. Yeah. Maybe f yeah. Yeah  that's g that's a good idea. Yeah. The idea it didn't have to necessarily be f a hinge  that was just one idea though. Yeah. Well I I suppose that things become design. But I mean i I was trying to think of like the design of others. I can't think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote  maybe small  sort of fatter ones  but there's nothing being done sort of out of left field  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think definitely doing something different is a good idea. I mean maybe design something  that's sort of like uh I suppose not everybody's everybody's hand's the same  but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier. Yeah  with a grip. It still might be hard to it still not the ho easiest thing to hold  yeah. Like yeah. Yeah. It's d yeah. I think it's definitely got to be a a one-handed a one-handed job. Yeah. But then maybe to go back to the to th s something along those things then. Yeah. Put it Even if you designed it in some in a way that you know  isn't a rectangle  but still pointed in a direction that had definite points. So if that's your thing and you got something like that instead  and there's your s you kn you know which way you're gonna pointing it. Um Does it say what does it say for n it says on there what we need to do for the next meeting  I think. T Right. I'm Manuel and I'm the Industrial Designer in in this project um. In the functional design phase I'm I'll be dealing mostly with the requirements  um we'll discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on. Um I suppose we'll work pretty much together on that one. Um um in the conceptual design um I'll be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials um of our product. And uh the detailed design in the detailed design I'll be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself  um so we're pretty much working together obviously on the design front here. Okay. Mm. Mm  mm. Right. So Mm. Well there are of course certain restrictions  you can't have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time  so there are always the some restrictions we have to apply here. Um however um one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be  that refers to the material  pretty much um. What are we gonna build that thing out of? How sturdy is it gonna be? Do we want it to last longer or rather have people whatever  have to buy one every half a year? Right. Right. One problem you'd get with this design is um the ball is a nice idea because of it's stability really  but of course  since it's a ball  it'll roll  so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least  down here somewhere  take away that part. That's one of the big issues. Also also you risk the hinges here. That's that's um a problem. That's that's interesting of course  but that's of course a weak point  yeah. E No no  uh uh. N n Uh  I'm your Industrial Designer  so i b well  the point is that well maybe I dunno. The shape is perhaps not the most ideal. As as stable as it is  there must be a compromise between um stability and design here  so. Mm. Mm. Well with the one-handed design you also have the the problem of the size w 'cause you know from cell phones  they can be too small. So if the remote is too small it if it's small it probably looks better  but may not be th as functional. So for that there's So The question is also  I dunno  d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it? It's probably going to lie around opened all the time anyway  so I don't know if a lid is a good idea. From stabil stability point of view uh it certainly is  but also you have to face it and take into account the more of these things break by accident  uh the more we sell. So it's don't make it too stable uh. To the other design. It looks cool. Uh functional. Right. Right. Question is what makes those game pads functional? W I think that's pretty much the form for full hand. So it's a round shape underneath that makes it comfy  right  makes it nice  so that's the essential part. Except for that I think we'll not probably not get a get away from some longer design. 'Cause you also have to know which way around to point this thing. You know  all that dif batteries right  and Batteries go weak as well  so um after a while you have to point it towards the uh towards the equipment you wanna control with it  right? So  have to m show which is the front  which is the back. I suppose you could do that. O of course the more technology you stick in that  the more it'll cost  so. Course you can do that. I mean of course it'll be evident after a while or if you look at it  it'll it'll be evident which way around to point it  since you have the the numbers and the and the the buttons and stuff  but um it's rather about an instinctual thing  like you just grab it  you don't have to s look at it  you know  which way around to point it. Otherwise the design of or the the point of putting two sensors on both sides um would probably work. Mm. Let's. Obviously Alright. ,The Project Manager gave the group new requirements on product features. The Industrial Designer gave a presentation on the working design of the device. He presented all the necessary internal components and how they operate together. He gave his preferences on energy sources and senders. The User Interface Designer presented the necessary functions of the remote  then compared the interfaces of two existing remotes. The group discussed making their remote more user-friendly; they proposed eliminating rarely-used buttons and making it easier to skip through channels. The Marketing Expert discussed user requirements with the group and showed that users wanted a fancier  less complicated remote that would not be easily lost. He suggested incorporating a menu and an LCD screen to satisfy these requirements. The group discussed how to incorporate a locator function. The Project Manager reminded the group to limit the number of complicated features due to the project's time constraints. The group had a discussion to decide on product features. They decided to include a clapping locator function and a device that allows the user to enter two numbers separately to get a two-digit number. Complicated functions will be hidden in a back panel. 
Um I'm Craig and I'm User Interface. Yeah. Well  my favourite animal would be a monkey. Then they're small cute and furry  and uh when planet of the apes becomes real  I'm gonna be up there with them. Yeah. I know um My parents went out and bought um remote controls because um they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house. So um for them it was just how many devices control. Uh. Mm-hmm. Great. And I'm Andrew and I'm uh our marketing expert. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah  that's that's it. Yeah. I will go. That's fine. Alright. So This one here  right? Okay. Very nice. Alright. My favourite animal is like A beagle. Um charac favourite characteristics of it? Is that right? Uh  right  well basically um high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family. And  yeah that they have lots of personality and uh be fit and in robust good health. So this is blue. Blue beagle. My family's beagle. I coulda told you a whole lot more about beagles. Boy  let me tell you. Impressionist. Alright. Mm. Superb sketch  by the way. Yep. I see a dog in there. Yep. Now I see a rooster. What kind is it? Is he aware that th it's his own cha tail he's chasing? Hmm. Probably when he was little he got lots of attention for doing it and has forever been conditioned. 'Kay. Um  can we just go over that again? Uh  so bas at twel Alright  yeah. Okay. So cost like production cost is twelve fifty  but selling price is is that wholesale or retail? Like on the shelf. Our sale our sale anyway. Yeah  okay okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Alright. Yes. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well right away I'm wondering if there's um th th uh  like with D_V_D_ players  if there are zones. Um f frequencies or something um as well as uh characters  um different uh keypad styles and s symbols. Um. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then a and then al the other thing international is on top of the price. I'm thinking the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region  whereas in another it'll be different  so Just a chara just a characteristic of the Just Or just like  basic product podi positioning  the twenty five Euro remote control might be a big hit in London  might not be such a big hit in Greece  who knows  something like that  yeah. Yep. Right away I'm making some kind of assumptions about what what information we're given here  thinking  'kay trendy probably means something other than just basic  something other than just standard. Um so I'm wondering right away  is selling twenty five Euros  is that sort of the thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Yep. Yeah  I'd say so  yeah. No. Yeah  yeah. Mm-hmm. Do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other other Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah  interesting thing about discussing um production of a remote control for me is that l as you point out  I just don't think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits. It's just like getting shoelaces with shoes or something. It just comes along. Do you know what I mean? Like so sort of like how do you I I mean one one way of looking at it would be  well the people producing television sets  maybe they have to buy remote controls. Or another way is maybe people who have T_V_ sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want a better one or something. But Right. Right. Okay so Right  so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses I think so. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Well like um  maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots. They're gone from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras  M_P_ three players  telephones  everything  agenda. So  like  I wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market  such as the lighting in your house  or um Yeah  yeah. An Yeah. Like  p personally for me  at home I've I've combined the um the audio video of my television set and my D_V_D_ player and my C_D_ player. So they w all work actually function together but I have different remote controls for each of them. So it's sort of ironic that that then they're in there um you know  the sound and everything it's just one system. But each one's got its own little part. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. That's just really good id Yep. Uh  sure. I remember when the first remote control my my family had was on a cable. Actually had a cable between it and the T_V_ and big like buttons that sort of like  like on a blender or something. And um  you know  when I think about what they are now  it's better  but actually it's still kind of  I dunno  like a massive junky thing on the table. Maybe we could think about how  could be more  you know  streamlined. S Something like that  yeah. Or whatever would be technologically reasonable. 'Cause it could b it could it could be that f it could be that functionally that doesn't make it any better  but that just the appeal of of not having You know  these days there's a r pe things in people's homes are becoming more and more like chic  you know. Um  nicer materials and might be be worth exploring anyway. Okay. Um. Before we wrap up  just to make sure we're all on the same page here  um  do we We were given sort of an example of a coffee machine or something  right? Well  um are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television? Or are we keeping sort of like a a design commitment to television features? I I don't know. Yep. Yeah  sure. Okay. Okay  yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Alright. Okay. Right. Um well this is the kick-off meeting for our our project. Um and um this is just what we're gonna be doing over the next twenty five minutes. Um so first of all  just to kind of make sure that we all know each other  I'm Laura and I'm the project manager. Do you want to introduce yourself again? Okay. Great. Okay. Um so we're designing a new remote control and um Oh I have to record who's here actually. So that's David  Andrew and Craig  isn't it? And you all arrived on time. Um yeah so des uh design a new remote control. Um  as you can see it's supposed to be original  trendy and user friendly. Um so that's kind of our our brief  as it were. Um and so there are three different stages to the design. Um I'm not really sure what what you guys have already received um in your emails. What did you get? Mm-hmm. Is that what everybody got? Okay. Um. So we're gonna have like individual work and then a meeting about it. And repeat that process three times. Um and at this point we get try out the whiteboard over there. Um. So uh you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it. So who would like to go first? Very good. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Lovely. Right. You can take as long over this as you like  because we haven't got an awful lot to discuss. Ok oh we do we do. Don't feel like you're in a rush  anyway. Ach why not We might have to get you up again then. I don't know what mine is. I'm gonna have to think on the spot now. Is that a whale? Ah. Okay. God  I still don't know what I'm gonna write about. Um. I was gonna choose a dog as well. But I'll just draw a different kind of dog. M my favourite animal is my own dog at home. Um That doesn't really look like him  actually. He looks more like a pig  actually. Ah well. Do you? Oh that's very good of you. Uh. Um he's a mixture of uh various things. Um and what do I like about him  um That's just to suggest that his tail wags. Um he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you  and very kind of affectionate and um uh and he's quite quite wee as well so you know he can doesn't take up too much space. Um and uh And he does a funny thing where he chases his tail as well  which is quite amusing  so It is. I think it is. He only does it after he's had his dinner and um he'll just all of a sudden just get up and start chasing his tail 'round the living room. Yeah  so uh Yeah  maybe. Maybe. Right  um where did you find this? Just down here? Yeah. Okay. Um what are we doing next? Uh um. Okay  uh we now need to discuss the project finance. Um so according to the brief um we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five Euro  um and we're aiming to make fifty million Euro. Um so we're gonna be selling this on an international scale. And uh we don't want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty Euros  so fifty percent of the selling price. Sure. All together. Um I dunno. I imagine That's a good question. I imagine it probably is our sale actually because it's probably up to the the um the retailer to uh sell it for whatever price they want. Um. But I I don't know  I mean do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all? Think it will? Um. Hmm. Oh yeah  regions and stuff  yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Well for a remote control  do you think that will be I suppose it's depends on how complicated our remote control is. Yeah  yeah. Okay. What  just like in terms of like the wealth of the country? Like how much money people have to spend on things like? Aye  I see what you mean  yeah. Marketing. Good marketing thoughts. Oh gosh  I should be writing all this down. Um. Mm. Yeah. Yeah  yeah. Like how much does  you know  a remote control cost. Well twenty five Euro  I mean that's um that's about like eighteen pounds or something  isn't it? Or no  is it as much as that? Sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds. Um  I dunno  I've never bought a remote control  so I don't know how how good a remote control that would get you. Um. But yeah  I suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky. Um right  okay. Let me just scoot on ahead here. Okay. Um well d Does anybody have anything to add to uh to the finance issue at all? Thin No  actually. That would be useful  though  wouldn't it  if you knew like what your money would get you now. Mm-hmm. Yeah  yeah. Oh. Five minutes to end of meeting. Oh  okay. We're a bit behind. Yeah. Right  so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know  do your your satellite and your regular telly and your V_C_R_ and everything? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Or even like  you know  notes about um what you wanna watch. Like you might put in there oh I want to watch such and such and look a Oh that's a good idea. So extra functionalities. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Um okay  uh I'd wel we're gonna have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes. Um I'll just check we've nothing else. Okay. Um so anything else anybody wants to add about what they don't like about remote controls they've used  what they would really like to be part of this new one at all? You keep losing them. Okay. Yeah. W You get those ones where you can  if you like  whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep. There I mean is that something we'd want to include  do you think? Dunno. Okay maybe. My goodness. Still feels quite primitive. Maybe like a touch screen or something? Okay. Uh-huh  okay. Well I guess that's up to our industrial designer. It looks better. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Right  well um so just to wrap up  the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes. So that's about um about ten to twelve by my watch. Um so inbetween now and then  um as the industrial designer  you're gonna be working on you know the actual working design of it so y you know what you're doing there. Um for user interface  technical functions  I guess that's you know like what we've been talking about  what it'll actually do. Um and uh marketing executive  you'll be just thinking about what it actually what  you know  what requirements it has to has to fulfil and you'll all get instructions emailed to you  I guess. Um. Yeah  so it's th the functional design stage is next  I guess. And uh and that's the end of the meeting. So I got that little message a lot sooner than I thought I would  so Mm-hmm. Uh-huh  yeah. Th Okay  well just very quickly 'cause this we're supposed to finish now. Um I guess that's up to us  I mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it  so um  you know Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Right  okay  we'll that's that's the end of the meeting  then. Um. So  uh thank you all for coming. Hi  I'm David and I'm supposed to be an industrial designer. Um  I just got the project announcement about what the project is. Designing a remote control. That's about it  didn't get anything else. Did you get the same thing? Cool. There's too much gear. Okay. Can't draw. Um. Yeah. Um  well anyway  I don't know  it's just the first animal I can think off the top of my head. Um. Yes. Big reason is 'cause I'm allergic to most animals. Allergic to animal fur  so um fish was a natural choice. Um  yeah  and I kind of like whales. They come in and go eat everything in sight. And they're quite harmless and mild and interesting. Tail's a bit big  I think. It's an after dinner dog then. Hmm. It does make sense from maybe the design point of view 'cause you have more complicated characters like European languages  then you need more buttons. So  possibly. Hmm. Yeah. And you keep losing them. Finding them is really a pain  you know. I mean it's usually quite small  or when you want it right  it slipped behind the couch or it's kicked under the table. You know. Yep. Mm-hmm. I think one factor would be production cost. Because there's a cap there  so um depends on how much you can cram into that price. Um. I think that that's the main factor. Cool. ,The project manager opens the meeting by stating the agenda. The industrial designer begins presenting  first describing the insides of a remote control. He lists the options for types of batteries  shapes for the remote case  materials to use  and functions to include such as push buttons  scroll wheels  and LCD screens. He then talks about the type of chip certain features would require. The interface specialist begins presenting  first defining user interface and then showing some examples of remotes. She mentions that many existing remotes do not have a nice appearance  and states her preference for a remote that is small and simple and contains a scrolling wheel. The marketing expert gives her presentation about user requirements and current trends. She shares that fruits and vegetables are popular  meaning curviness and assymetry are in. The group decides to use LCD screens to give the remote style. They discuss what material should be used  talk about how the surface of the case should look  and plan out the general user interface. After they make some decisions about the remote  the project manager closes the meeting by telling them what their tasks will be until the next meeting. 
Hello. Hello. You have to put it exactly on the on the yeah. I took your mouse. Yeah just yeah  no  that's for me  I just have to make some notes. I got my uh mouse. yeah. Uh actually my laptop doesn't work  switch it on again. Oh no. So you all read what we are going to do or not? Okay. Yeah  that's right. I just made a a simple uh presentation. So you put some things in it. Okay. How does this work? I dunno. This one? Ah cool. Okay. So that's my name . Uh we're going to make uh a remote control  you already know that. Just have a look  are we going to uh this agenda of our meeting. You know  this is about twenty five minutes  this meeting. So um the thing we have to know is you already know what we're going to do  you also read what this the things or  not yet  okay. So um  yeah  it has to be original  trendy  user-friendly that's what we're going to design. Uh first we have uh uh three steps of uh making the the remote control. Fir the first thing is th the functional design  that's very important. We have to look what the needs are  the effects of the functional design  and and how the mm the the remote control works  so that's where we're going to look in the functional design  it's for the f next meeting. The the second thing is the conceptual design  that's what it that's uh the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface. And we have to look what uh the market is doing for what kind of uh remote controls are in the market. And the third thing is uh the detailed design um and that's exa yeah  you know what it is  it's exactly how it looks and whatever. Okay so uh no  this is a these are two smartboards  with the uh f uh s an introduction of that one. And you already saw you know all that that you here can put uh things in the the red project uh map. Folder  okay. So no okay have a look at that one. Okay. So uh what we're going to do first is um so you can read. You have to uh draw uh a favourite animal on the whiteboard and um and say why it's your favourite animal. So and you have this is just to try it out and we have to uh use a different pen colours and different thickness of the pen. So okay  so first have to show you  maybe you can come here to have a look how it works. Yes? Okay. This a new page  it's okay. Use pen format. and a different colour can use here no I just take the pink. You take oh there's no pink  okay  oh just purple  okay. No blue. And uh line width ten. Okay uh just take what I'm going to draw is an elephant. Just draw slowly  because otherwise it won't work. It's a very nice elephant  you can see. I dunno what it looks but it doesn't matter. I just h Something like this? Oh no Yeah  okay. Because I like uh okay. Just takes so long  okay. Whatever  just. You erased this one. It's a bit slow you can see  this is a bit annoying. Okay  so just for you guys just one of you can draw a painting if you want. Just don't um yeah  just u use it like that  yeah. That's okay. It's in format. Yeah. Just No it has to be an animal  so if that's it's it should be a shna snake or something. Okay. Okay okay. Okay. Okay  cool. Hmm yeah  that's nice. Uh do you have to write down why uh that doesn't matter  just it's to get used to the whiteboard  but it's okay. Just make a new blank new blank page. Yeah  not too far to the to the t pen top. Maybe you should hold your pen a bit more to the back  so that no  to the yeah. No  it's a dog. Uh we d only have twenty five minutes  so. Use your fantasy. Just hold it more more to the back then you don't have okay. No  that's okay  thank you. I thought these pens would be just um uh you write it down and you download it to Word  you already did it or no? No  not yet  okay. But it's just Sorry? Yeah  I know  but I d I I thought it would be just in in in uh typed words in Word  so that's not just it's just a picture. So it's not that cool as I th thought it would be. No. I don't know  what time did we start this meeting  I'm not sure. Half past. Okay. Okay  perfect. Yeah  thank you. Now we just have to save everything  so. Oh this is definitely the best one. Okay  so uh what we know is that we have to sell this uh remote control for about twenty five Euros. Okay  that's. And uh we have to make a profit of fifty million Euros  so we have to uh use a big market in Europe. The production cost are about half the price of selling price  sorry. So can someone make a a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million  I dunno. Uh so we're gonna have a little discussion about um what experience are with a remote control the and everything  so just have a look how it we think about remote controls. Oh yeah  that's a good question. I think it's I'm not I'm not sure  it's not mm I think I don't think you can buy a a a universal uh remote control for twenty five Euros  so not sure  but Okay  so we we just say we just say that's universal remote control. Okay  perfect. Yeah  everything just so a lot of buttons on the remote control. No  just everything.. so yeah  what what what's a remote control  it's just a black thing with some buttons on it  it's not nothing very special  but um yeah  that's right. So do you have any ideas how it has to look for for usability or user Hmm yeah. That's right. Should be a good point. Just big enough for the buttons we have  that's that's it. But you you you you think about uh uh one you can fold open. Okay  yeah  that's cool. Maybe for the D_V_D_ pla player or something  if you just okay. Yeah. Why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control? There are buttons on it. Okay. But it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it. Yeah. Yeah. So. And if you have a touch screen in it  it's definitely too too fragile uh fragile. No. You can put games on your remote control. Whatever. Oh maybe that's a good idea  just to put it on your television and just s recharge  you never have to use any batteries. Yeah  how m how mu how how expensive uh is a normal recharger? I dunno. Uh if you th look at the market  it's probably it's still the best way just to put batteries in it  because maybe it's too expensive. Yeah  that's right  yeah. The option  just the option  that's cool. Yeah. Has it be has does it has to b have to be um uh like a different form than a normal remote control or Yeah Yeah. Yeah  just for the T_V_ and just the normal function  that's fine. But maybe it's maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very uh uh what's it's called? Maybe it's hard t No  that's right. So maybe we have to to uh keep it like mm a square  just normal remote control. Just think about it. We have to close this uh to finish this uh meeting  so. There's some more things. We have uh another thirty minutes  so then we're going to meet again. So you know what you have to what you have to do? Yeah. Yeah  I think this if you you have to n know if it's for s a T_V_  a D_V_D_ player  all that things. Also from a user  but all these things together. Yeah  everything. Yeah  no maybe not not uh  that's not a f that's something for for for yeah. That's not for you. Just if what's in the market  what's normal  uh what kind of uh buttons do you have. Yeah  it's alright. Yeah  just is that okay? Okay. So see you in thirty minutes. For the next time you have to uh put it exactly on the square  so your laptop. No  sorry. Good morning. Okay. Good morning. Should I bring my uh pen too? Or Okay. I do. My laptop is crashing. Cr Help help help. Test test. Yes  it's working. I think my laptop is a bit etchy. Uh p Okay. Wow. Wow. Take it easy. I I was gonna make a cat too. Okay. Nice  eh? Uh. Excuse me. Yeah  it probably would be universal. Hmm  maybe  I don't know. And uh also for the V_C_R_ and uh D_V_D_ player and okay. Yeah  probably. Okay. And how big should it be? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah n Yeah  or you c O or you could th think of an uh uh a small touch screen on the remote control. Uh maybe be uh it's it's Yeah  or um maybe to keep it uh easy and uh small. Uh like a a to have Yeah  maybe it would. Kid-proof. And uh how about the batteries? Uh should you put it in a recharger or a just Mm yeah. Yeah  I dunno. Yeah  if you buy it uh separately from your phone it's probably expensive  but I don't know what the project uh projection costs are for such a thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  but I have a mouse that's uh uh also uh Yeah  and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station  or you can change your batteries  so. Yeah. N uh if if we want to make it special  we probably have to do a lot of testing  if it really works. Yeah. Yeah. And what we have to think about too is uh uh buttons that you use often are um maybe uh like when you fold it open  when you have it closed  you can still uh do the th the functions. Yeah. But n yeah  but uh i basically when I'm watching T_V_ I'm just using like five buttons or so  so. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hello. Ah. Plate? Uh I also forgot my mouse  but I don't need my mouse  I think. Damn computers. Can you hear me? Hello? Test. I dunno. Check. Okay. I think it works. Mm-hmm. We're gonna make a remote control. Press F_ eleven. Folder  yes. Ah I can see it now. It look like a dinosaurs. Okay. Let me try one. Okay. Mm. Okay and then uh what's the colour? How do I do Ah. I'll take this one. Uh there has to be water  but Yeah yeah  but it's an animal it's an animal that lives in the water. So I first uh draw the water. Uh. Okay  and now I make the animal. It's a fish. Mm-hmm. So. Um This is a worm. Okay  who next? Uh Okay. Well Paul? I think it's a pig. Or a dog. A sheep? No. Yeah yeah  it's a real pen. Oh. Y you can you can't edit in the edit it in Word. Oh  okay. Half past ten. Brilliant. Yep. Yeah  my first question was does it have to be a a universal remote control? Because we sell it uh uh uh lonely from the t and not with the television  we sell it uh apart. So I Because Yeah  I know uh you can buy a re a universal uh control for uh only twenty uh Euros Yeah  I think. Okay. Well I th I thought about um making it the same uh style as the television  we don't have uh the same television uh all the time  so uh that's no matter. Um if we uh control the V_C_R_ and the D_V_D_ player player with it uh it has to be clear  because uh kids and uh elderly are gonna use it  so uh it's not only for the uh technical persons. Um I think it must be a very good control  so you can uh uh uh act uh use it from uh everywhere in your room  the the infrared uh thing must be from very good quality. No. Yeah. I dunno um Yes Ah that's that's Ah right right. Oh that's good  yeah. Yeah. Yeah  but Yeah but it's not reachable I think  touch screen. And we have to care for uh the strength of the remote control  because uh uh remote controls are most uh things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often uh broken. Yeah and a lots uh uh lots of kids use it and touchscreen is not uh kids uh Um Ma maybe a home station. Yeah. Ah yeah. Yeah  but a home station is uh a really good idea  because uh lots of people are uh lose their remote control and don't know where it is  and now you can put it always at the same place. Maybe it's Therefore it's a good idea  but maybe it's expensive. Yeah. You can yeah  you can buy it with it. Oh yeah. Uh I I set something on paper already  size  looks  uh usable  uh the buttons on usable places  uh the the on off button must be on top  uh it has to lay good in the hand  you you have to uh Yeah  I don't I don't know I don't know if we You can make it very special  to create our own um looks  but it's very hard to Nah. Yeah yeah  what Paul already said. Uh on on top are the the basic options on top  and if you fold it open Mm. If you if if you make to fold open it's or also an uh the strength uh is not s as good as a normal uh remote control. Okay. Um for m for me uh the Marketing Expert  the user requirements uh specification  do I need to think as a user  a as a a a only the looks and the Okay. Yeah  it's also about strength and uh for everything uh. Okay. Yep. Okay. Yeah  me too. Okay  well done. Oh Paul. Ciao. Bye bye. Two. Good morning. Mouse. Come on. There we are. Let's just check one more time. Mm. Yeah. One uh most to the right. Yes that one. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Purple. Looks very nice. A pink elephant. The water is important. Yeah. Yeah. Like this? Okay. Um let's make it um a dog. Ooh. Ah okay. A pig? I can make a dog. Um 'Kay  I make a cat of it. Oh  not too quick. No I have it. I just draw too quick I think. Okay  that's it. More. It's just to get used to it. Yeah  that's right  it but you actually got to write on the paper. You really got to write on that paper. Yeah  but it's just a picture. You really No. It's a donkey. Uh I think it was uh Yeah. Piece of cake. Uh easy. Universal. And only television? Or more devices? Ah okay. Not just a T_V_. Okay. Well we can try to make it special. Well Yeah. Nothing N It shouldn't be too big  but I don't think we can make it too small  'cause it has to have a lot of functions  so. We can't make it smaller than the things we see now I think. Yeah. Or we have to make something uh like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem. Maybe then you can make it s smaller and uniquer  maybe more trendy. Fold open  where you can see uh more options. I think Yeah  something uh on top  just dren general things like volume and T_V_ channels and inside things you don't use that often. Yeah b I wanted No you can make an uh manual in it. But that's Yeah  I think it's much uh too expensive. Yeah  too fragile. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe that's a good idea  but yeah  we have to look at the price now I think. Well uh how much is your uh standards uh mobile phone recharger? Maybe have uh Yeah  'cause well Yeah. Maybe uh use it as a separate option. Sell it uh separately. Rechargeable. Yeah. Yeah. Well I think we have to look at that  'cause well you can do the standard way  but then you won't Well you can um have uh the basic things on the same place  like on off button on top and the T_V_ channels one two three four as a block  and then the volume uh obviously on t on top  so you can see. But the rest is uh you don't use that often  so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it  it should be clear as well. So it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control I think  so you can do something unique with that. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. That's what I meant. Uh Okay  but yeah. No  what you want to do with it. Yeah  I also wrote down some stuff that you want on a Technical fun fu What do you want to do with your remote control  what do you need on your remote control. I already wrote some down  some ideas. Yep. There's already a document in the folder about it. Okay. I will. It didn't say that. Your fault. Bye bye. ,"The Project Manager announced that the remote should only control television  and that the marketing should be targeted towards ages 40 and above. The Marketing Expert presented the results of a lab study on users of remote controls  and showed that users want a fancier  less complicated remote that does not get lost easily. The group decided not to use speech recognition or an LCD screen to target the older demographic. The User Interface Designer discussed the button functions and how to make channel-changing easier. The group decided not to include programmable ""favorites"" buttons. The Industrial Designer presented the internal components of the device. The group discussed having the remote light up when used. He also stressed that the remote must be compatible with all television brands. The Project Manager corrected his target group announcement and announced that the target age group was actually ages 40 and below. The group again discussed the possibility of adding speech recognition and LCD screens to the design but decided that it was not feasible. The group decided to have the remote light up when used and is including teletext. The Marketing Expert was instructed to report on trendwatching. "
Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'm Robin. I'm the Marketing Manager. Mm-hmm  okay. I dunno. Your microphone's just Yeah. I don't know. We can have have a whole menagerie. Right. Hello. Um I'm gonna go for the dog  and I'm gonna draw one badly as well. Uh. looks like it's going to be a dachshund or something. Right. There's my dog. Um I like dogs because they're very loyal. And they're always happy  so whenever whenever you're feeling sort of a bit a bit down or tired  they're always coming up and they're always um quite excited. So um you can always have a lot of fun with a dog. And they're also good for exercise as well. You can sorta get out and they they sorta never get tired. And and when they're tired they're quite cute as well  so. Okay  that's why I like dogs. Great. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. I've Okay. Yeah. Um one of the things um we found from the market research is that people often get confused by the number of buttons on them as well. 'Cause there's quite often lots and lots. And um sometimes uh they sort of remote controls defeat their own purpose because you're sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room. So whereas in the past you'd have to get up to change the channel  now you have to get up to sort of pick up the remote. So so I don't we need to sort of maybe think about how um we could maybe uh develop a remote control which moves around the room. I don't know. That's that's maybe something for the future when you can talk to your television  but Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I mean we've done some research um about sort of you know what the cutting edge sort of hand held devices are  and a lot of them sort of use you know they're like they're like mini laptops. So it's possible that we could devise a system where where you're you're basically sort of holding a a miniature computer which is controlling all your your sort of your television  your stereo  and where you know if you buy a new thing then it sort of you can link it to that as well  maybe. Okay. If you just click return it should be okay. It'll get rid of the message. If you hit just hit return and it should get rid of the message. Oh you've got. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay cool. Okay cheers. I'm Louisa. I'm the User Interface Designer. I'm not exactly sure what you mean by tool training. I don't mind. Um. Let's see. Good job I got pockets today. Are we supposed to do this right now  do you think  or? Oh. Right here we go. Okay. I think that I would have to say that my favourite animal is the cat. Little smiley cat there. Um and this would be because they're very independent  uh they're very intelligent  compared to dogs maybe. Um and they can be very very affectionate. Some people don't think so but I know very affectionate cats. Um. Um and they can look after themselves. Shall I rub that out  actually? That's quite good. Can I just check? Is this just a television remote? Because a lot of um systems are kind of T_V_ video combined now  or T_V_ D_V_D_ combined. And one of the most annoying things is having like five remotes in the house. So if you've got a combined system  it could be a combined remote. Or is it just a television that we're supposed to be doing? Comes to your whistle. I think that might be back to the start. Um if you grab the kind of uh slide to the left and pull it down? I'm not exactly clear on what we're designing the rem remote for. Is this a mun multi-functional one or do we decide that ourselves as we go away and work on it? Right. Okay. Okay. I'm Nick. I am the Industrial Designer. Tool training. Yeah. Yes. Okay. You've lost uh your microphone there. Okay  yeah. I'll I'll Shall I see if I can get across without just tangling everything. Okay. There's one. Didn't think of that. 'Kay uh pens are over here. I'll try the red pen. Okay. Um. I'm gonna go for the bear which I'm be able to draw very well  but I'll have a bash at it. Uh. Ooh ooh I lost it there. I think I've just knocked the microphone. Um. We'll g then we'll go for a a s small small bear. Um and I like my animal that looks nothing like a bear because um I dunno maybe because there's so many cartoon characters made up after the bear like the jungle book characters and stuff like that. Great. Yes. Um I with some remote controls the buttons were a little small so they're quite hard to press so maybe we make something with uh easy to press buttons. As that is the main function. Yes. Um sort of easy to use so the buttons are accessible. is easy to use and see. Yes. Sorry  you go. You go. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Maybe we could um have better instructions with the remote. Or are we just doing the design of the remote control itself  or sort of the instructions that would come with it? 'Kay. Or not. slide four Okay. Yes. 'Kay  yes. I think you just said at the start it was a television remote control  so maybe we should just stick to that unless we get told otherwise. 'Kay. Okay  that's great. Right  so start of the first meeting. Uh. Right  so agenda of the first meeting. Where we uh We have twenty five minutes for this meeting. We uh are to get acquainted. So does everyone want to say who they are? that seem sensible? And I'm Alastair and I'm the project leader. Alright okay  so tool training. Um. Project plan. So does anyone have any uh thoughts as to the tool training that uh is required? Neither am I. Oh I see  so we shouldn't really be Oh right okay  so. So we have the project team  which is to um basically to come up with a new r remote control device. Uh we have uh the starting base was the original which has been in existence now for a period of time. And uh our idea is to uh to make the new remote control device uh more user friendly than the previous one  and to to be trendier  to be with it  and therefore to uh to get a bigger market share and bigger audience. So um method of doing this is uh split up as you can see into uh the functional design  the conceptional design  and the detailed design. So um in each of these uh phases we'll uh basically be handing over to yourselves  the designers of this uh this device. And uh having uh meetings so that we can uh during the course of the day um come up with a better better inst implement than we had before. And therefore um have a successful uh conclusion to the day. Um and you'll be doing uh various designs uh throughout the day to meet this end. So we've got tool training. Try out whiteboard. Uh. So we will um. Right so everyone's to uh supposedly uh draw their favourite animal over on the white board over there. I guess this is uh make sure the whiteboard works. So uh I don't know who wishes to go first. Do you wish to go f Have a first bash at uh whatever. Ah uh. But now you you uh you'll move out from the microphone and the camera. I take it that I would I would guess so. Or Technical problems. I mean you designers are meant to come up with these sort of things. Next. I don't see as there's any need to. There's plenty of space. I mean whatever. Exactly. We've had more time to prepare over this side  so we've all stuck our bits and pieces in our pockets. The three pens are underneath. You get marks for artistic impression. So you're just doing the face. Right  um. Well I've not actually had too many pets uh over my uh time 'cause to be honest with you uh I'm not too keen on them anyway. Not to worry. So what my daughters have got at the moment is they've got uh a few fish and so hopefully um won't prove too difficult to draw. Uh As you can see that my artist artistic work is useless as well. Anyway um. And uh one of the best uh things about fish is that they don't really take uh too much looking after because uh with most of the animals if you're going away on holiday or whatever  you've gotta spend money or get a friend or whatever to look after them for you. Whereas if you got fish  you just gotta put the food in a a a dripper feed which feeds them over the uh couple of weeks that you're away and uh change the water every couple of months  and buy in a few plants  so. Other than the fact that they keep dying  uh fish are uh are not are are are reasonable pets in that uh they're low maintenance. Right. Okay  uh if we're still all with us. Right okay  so. Work has been done on uh this uh project where by um twenty five Euros is uh the uh expected uh selling price. That information has come from our marketing manager here. So we're looking to sell internationally  not just in Europe. We're looking at um having our production costs limited to uh twelve and an half Euro per unit. And therefore making a profit margin of uh well not actually a profit margin it's uh because obviously you're gonna have overheads and various other costs to uh take uh from uh from that to give you your profit margin per unit. And so depending what the uh the overhead uh costs are will determine uh how many units we're uh looking to sell or projecting to sell at this point in time. So um Experience with remote control  first ideas. New remote. So I guess we're looking at um having a discussion at this point in time to help uh you um folks design our our new model as it were. So uh any any thoughts? Okay  so so basically we're looking for some um we're looking for a device that is um robust and and therefore uh won't get damaged too easily. Um we're looking for a device that is uh What was the other things you said there? Easy to use. Use. And see. Okay. Uh. Mm-hmm. Oh I w um basically I'll get back to you on that. But it seems to me sensible  'cause as you rightly said  there's nothing more annoying than having three or four devices littered about the uh about the room. And uh So a device for for all remotes. Hmm. But is it in a sense it's r um mutually exclusive. You can't have both the th the one device and then have few buttons on it to 'cause you want you want simplicity as well  you want any idiot to be able to use it. Whilst at the same time you want  as you rightly said  one remote for all. And so these are probably mutually exclusive options that uh Hmm you could argue that experience of using devices and similar devices as people get more and more used to using remotes  therefore they're more with handling them  therefore you can make them more complicated as time goes on. Better instructions. Mm-hmm. Okay. Um well we've got five minutes before the end of the meeting. So uh we have to uh start winding up. Um is there Next meeting in thirty minutes. So um Right  so we've got I_D_ the Come on  where's my Oh there we go. Yeah. That's what I was looking for. Right. So we've got function Oh what happened to the Right. Right. Sorry about that. Okay  so we've got um the working design for I_D_. For U_I_D_ the technical functions design. Marketing  the user requirement specification. Specific instructions will be sent to you by your person by your personal coach. So. Are we all clear what objectives we're looking to meet in the next thirty minutes? And I guess I'll try and write up some minutes of uh this meeting to uh to give it to you for the next meeting. Television remote control. That's true  'cause during during the course of our day we might make decisions based on information or meetings that would change where we're going. But at this point in time I think you're right that uh shall we make it just a T_V_. Okay? So we will depart. We will stay here and uh and break off. And I'll do minutes and and we'll see you in half and hour. Okay. Right s ,The project manager opened the meeting and read the minutes of the previous meeting. The industrial designer and user interface designer presented the prototype they created  which was designed to look like a banana. The marketing expert conducted an evaluation of the prototype. The team found that  although the overall design of the prototype was attractive  its yellow color was ugly. The team rated the prototype highly on its ease of use and felt that its yellow color and shape detracted slightly from its ability to be misplaced and that a feature which causes the remote to make noise based on its proximity to a television needed to be added. The team thought the prototype was fashionable and not technologically innovative or spongy. The project manager led the team in calculating the production costs of the remote and ensuring that they aligned with the project budget. The costs were over budget  so the team opted to exclude the LCD from their design to meet their budget. The team conducted an evaluation of the project process and found that they performed well and were somewhat satisfied by the resources available to them. 
'Kay. Hmm. Okay everybody. Welcome to the detailed design meeting. Um Let's see. Our agenda. Last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that. Um and I think looks like we've come up with some ideas. Um and we also talked about materials we'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary. Um so for later in the meeting I've done a a spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take a look at that. Um and see if it's changed at all from when we last discussed it. Um so actually I think Yeah um f you guys wanna give a prototype presentation of Oh is that broccoli? 'S a very bright strawberry. Oh yeah. Yeah. Oh. Um if you wanna look in your project documents folder  there's an Excel spreadsheet. Um the only one that's in there  production costs. And if you open it up. Um I've just stuck the numbers in  it was a real challenge there. But if I missed anything that we've gone over  or if you see something that has changed I mean  we decided on batteries  and the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced iPod-like button. Um I said uncurved or flat. I think that's what you have there  is that right? For the for the plastic part would be Oh. Okay. Right. Well yeah. If we're talking about the area just oh I d I dunno. I guess we'd have to contact the company that makes them and see. Um so what else? There's plastic for that area around the button. Um and then rubber would be the squishy like thing right? Um and lots of special colours actually. Uh scroll wheel. Do you see anything that I've missed? Okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine  which is even less than twelve point five  which means we'd be making even more of a profit. And if we sold a lot of squishy things. Boo yeah. Okay. S So Mm. Did y what did you work on? The Okay. Do you wanna Okay. I think that's Huh  the PowerPoint one? Yeah. Um we can do it separately and then discuss it if if that's what people wanna do. Wait  one is true and so these are the questions we're answering. And one is One  right okay. If it's somewhere in between you put four. Okay. Are we just about ready? I don't think so. It's yeah the the marker thing kinda stopped working last time we Our animals will forever be there. Un unless you feel you need it t to okay okay. We'll Five. I I think we should Yeah. Yeah. Six. I wasn't cheating I swear. Uh. Oh I thought it was the other way round. So we do have about the same thing  we just have it the other way Oh gosh. Okay. Well Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Three. Two. One. Two. Two point I think I missed two. Wait  is that two point one? One point four  one point five. Okay right that's I have two of them. One. Yeah. Yeah. Three. Three. Two. Five. Four. Two. Okay. Um No no that's um I think we should look at the ones that like where s where people said four  where um it looks like we might wanna discuss changing an aspect of the remote. The that was material. Mm. Um Mm-hmm. Does the shape See I'm having I'm having trouble imagining the is it uh gonna be the size  like the the controller? It or bigger? Because Yeah. No but I imagine even if it was bigger  like if it's round and it's big then you you can't get that's why remote controls are long because you have that thumb kind of so c they could all be bananas and cucumbers. Um but I don't s I I personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there  like it's an awkward position. Yeah. And would it even resemble fruit that way? I mean Yeah. Yeah. Yeah that I I when you were holding that before  it actually looked yeah. Yeah. What if um the it was just patterns on like we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber. You know like like just a printed yeah or coloured yeah. Or I mean we could even have fruit like around I mean But if we if we need yeah. And if we wanna incorporate the fruit thing somehow  there might be I mean if it if it in if it uh conflicts with the comfort of actually holdi holding the Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Well see th the reason the broccoli works is you can kinda hold it like that  which is a nice kind of yeah. But I mean is there some way we could make it this kind of shape? 'Cause like kind of Yeah  yeah. Or like even Or even like Yeah like you said  like a joystick like that. You know? 'Cause that  I think I mean that fits the whole round iPod idea. And you still have the comfort of holding it like that. And you could like if it's like this  you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part. But I mean it do we have any other ideas about that? The batteries are going in the back? The reason I I ga I didn't give it a one I think I gave it a three because I thought you'd have to like unc clip no you could Just like any other one. Okay. Yeah. Right. Okay. Mm. Okay. Yeah. And it would probably cost more to produce  'cause they're irregular. Yeah. Which is why printing might be like just printing the fruit on fruit. Mm. Not really Well we've done finance evaluation criteria  production evaluation. Um so project evaluation. I guess we're supposed to discuss um the prod the process of the project and how satisfied oh  oh it's alright. Uh. Yeah. Um Did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity in the sort of Yeah. I mean fruit and squishiness. How c more creative can you get? And how was our leadership and teamwork? Well I thought my leadership was crap personally. Excuse me  am I allowed to say that? Yeah. Um. Yeah  well I'm never gonna do a management position  I know that now. Um yeah  I thought we all worked very well together. Yeah. Yeah. Very democratic. No spats  that was good. Um and the means for like the materials we used  how convenient were they? Like the the pens  the whiteboard  I mean we used Are you a Mac person? Huh. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. I can't say I found everything particularly helpful. Like I It Really? I mean m my problem yeah  yeah. 'Cause my problem was  you guys had access to like they'd put send you to sites and stuff right? See I couldn't do that  so I didn't really know what you guys were doing. And when you were talking about it I was just like you know that's wh that's why I seemed so ignorant when when you were j explaining things  'cause I Yeah. Yeah. System. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  huh. Yeah. Yeah. Well I mean we really got into talking about like personal practicalit like it wasn't necessarily what was like we would never have thought of fruit or sponginess you know? So it's Oh right. given certain information or Just yeah. Mm  mm. What do you guys think of the pens? It asks about that. Mm. Yeah and I I've f forgotten once or twice to check the box. Mm. And new ideas found? Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Seems kind of like an excessive reiteration. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well does anyone wanna talk about fruit more while we still have time? Any other ideas for Um we still have time if there's any other input. I mean the I think we did really well personally  which is why we've you know  gone through this so quickly. 'Cause I mean we've all we all kind of agreed our product is satisfactory  it fits the budget  and it's trendy. So. Um. So I think that's all for today. Meeting adjourned. Yeah. So I guess we're supposed to write final reports. 'Cause I don't know. Hmm. Hmm. Or is that just me? Okay well um. So our design looks something like this. This being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever. This is a button  serves as the power button if you hold it down  and if you just tap on it I think it brings up the menu. And uh the base of the remote control  which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel  is interchangeable. So you can change the colour  according to your to suit your living room or whatever. And it comes yeah  I can change the vegetable. This one's broccoli. So this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want. This is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it. This is a mango. The it's trendy fruit  it's not just ordinary fruits. You don't have orange  you have mango. Um I guess strawberry's not as trendy  but So we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control. And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them  because they'll need to switch 'em out. Mm-hmm. Well the locator is just chip that's inside there. And the beeper's also inside there too somewhere. Yeah we didn't design that. But it would be coordinating with that of course. Mm-hmm. My impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes. But it's really not very clear  because you got single curve and double curve and d I dunno what that means. One side is curved and then the other side is curved. Mm-hmm. No I think that's alright. Mm-hmm. Hmm? Feels like play-dough. I'm gonna say yes. I imagine they're somewhere on the front. We have a little case that you slip 'em in. 'Kay Five. Five. It's four if you wanna do that. It adds to sixteen  so that's four. Oh I thought she said five. Six. Huh? Wait a minute. I thought it was the other way round too. Sh Yeah I I was thinking one means no points  you know  all the way up to the top. I'll just I'll just reverse them all. It's no problem. I thought you guys hated it. Okay. Say two. Two. One. Uh two. Yeah I put it down as one point four for some reason. Mine has all kinds of problems. Uh three. Wait why did I put three? I meant one on mine too. Three point one. I have four. Three. One. Two. Three. Two. Mm-hmm. I think the wheel would probably be mm. I think the base would definitely be larger  'cause some of these are not as easy to hold. They're kinda smallish. Yeah. Well if they're that s uh stress ball stuff they would be pretty squishable. Mm. Not that I can think of. Rhubarb. So it's just colour  and not necessarily the shape of a strawberry. We could make it that shape but just have different colours  and call 'em the different fruits. We went with shape because we were having fun with the play-dough. Mm-hmm. That everyone gave that a one or a two. Yeah they'd probably be either on the front or the side of the remote. No I imagine there'd be sort of a hatch door  yeah um like on a normal remote. So it would probably either in the f no it can't be in the front 'cause the I_R_'s right there  but it'd be on one of the sides probably. Yeah I'd agree with changing the shape. Um  I was just having fun making strawberries and stuff. It might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape. I bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too. Sure. Sponginess. I think it was good. We knew what we were doing. It was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute. Well you told us when to start and when to end  and that's all that matters. Well I'm not a big fan of any Microsoft  PowerPoint or any of this stuff. No no I never touch Macs either. I just use the Unix or the off market  sort of WordPerfect and all these other things. Yeah. Well the problem is if you don't like my new computer never has WordPerfect so I have to go track someone down who has an old disk and then I have to reinstall it. So I have all these documents I can't use now. But yeah I mean I guess it's okay. Yeah. I never use it. Yeah. My first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how a remote works. Yeah it probably does. Yeah. Yeah well mine was mostly made up except when they told me like you know titanium costs more than wood to make a remote control. As if you'd wanted to. Well I think it's interesting how it all went together  like I had the stuff about how me how rubber's cheap  and you have how people want it to be spongy  and It seems planned you know. Yeah. If I hadn't been told that fruit was They're pretty cool. They're kinda hard to write with though. They're nicer than the pen that I'm using  because like your stuff actually shows up here  rather than having to look at the screen and write. But even so  I dunno. Oh yeah. Well they drop off if you like move too much. But I don't think we're supposed to be testing these microphones. Maybe we are. I don't know. Well the thing is  like I actually worked in a company  and I had a role and I had to go to meetings. And like the last thing I would have wanted would be to have to watch a video 'cause I missed a meeting. Like usually I missed meetings deliberately. There's just there's really not that much information that actually goes through a real meeting  like when you're actually at a real meeting in a real company. It's mostly like rehashing old stuff. And you're sort of going over general stuff that anybody who's sort of on task should already know. It's like the there's just really not a lot of information that goes through. It seems like way overkill. Like if I missed a meeting I could probably get it summed up in like one sentence. I wouldn't need to have to watch like a t two hour video with the sound and the transcript and I think I've learned not to bring play-dough to meetings. It's hard enough to get people actually paying attention. Especially if you have food. All of us? Um evaluation criteria. I've got a presentation. So I need where's the cable? Right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole this whole project we've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start. Um. Right. This doesn't okay. Um the method is we well I've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing. And um the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way  feel in a certain way  and this is everything's listed down. Um  look in a certain way  feel in a certain way  it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use. These are all things we looked at at the start  um and criteria that have to be met. We have to use a table  I'll show you that later  together to decide whether it meets the standards. And we we have therefore in total um We have five we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated. And um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria. I would like to show you the table we have to use. Um. No. This is the table. Can you see this here? Um so the que the questions I've given you c could you write that down? True is one and and false is seven. And we'll just go through each point together  hopefully. Um. I think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow. I dunno how it works exactly  I haven't been told. Yeah it's in the um it's in the project documents. It's called evaluation criteria. And it's under evaluation. Yeah. You've found it all? So it was um Yeah true's one. Do you want us to discuss this together or do you want us to do it singly? Yeah okay. Um  yes it's if it's fancy you put one  if it's really unfancy it's seven. Yeah  something. They shouldn't really be questions. Should be more like Are the batteries easy to insert? Yes? Very very true. Okay. Okay. Apparently I'm supposed to use the whiteboard. Do we um is it necessary? We'll just do um Yeah. Okay. I don't feel any right um Right so one point one? We'll just go in a circle. Right. Ooh I don't know. Right. One? Five. Two. Okay so do we just add it up and divide it by four? Is that what the company does? Yeah? Oh no. It adds to thirteen. One five five two. One five five two is thirteen  over four for now. I think that's um next? Really? Two. Uh-oh. Right. One point three is Yeah. I really Well uh Yeah yeah. It was one is true and false is seven. I should've kept the table up. Right  well I'm glad this came out. Yeah. No. Oh that's quite funny. Okay. Okay. So  starting again  one point one? Two. Okay  one point two? Two. Okay. Um  one point three? Ha. Two point one? Yeah. Oh dear  okay. Sorry. Two and one. Sorry about that. T two point two  which is one point five. Okay. Three point one. Is that correct on my slide? Yeah? One  four  three  three  three point two? Three point three. Four point one? Two. Four point two. Two and four point three. One  two. Right so I put one on that. Okay I'll um I'll just do the calculations now if you want to continue. Or is it tedious? I'm I'm sorry this was so tedious for everyone. I didn't know how else to do it. Okay. Well the worst ones were three point one. Do does every ones have the slide? Three point one. Slide show. Material technologically innovative  okay. Um  do you want to change it? What are the suggestions? I don't know  anyone? Yeah that it's three point one was not that good. Four point one. The shape. Four point two? Yeah. That looked really good. Are there any fruits that look like broccoli  no? I think that broccoli is my favourite actually. Uh despite the Yeah. Yeah and just have the colour match or something. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um Think the critical ones came out to be yeah that one.. Batteries easy to insert for some reason  which can be easily I think that's not a problem any more. No. I think everyone's under three anyway. So I think it's yeah those are the only two points. Yeah. Do you want this and we can all No. It's alright yeah? Yeah. Yeah we didn't we uh it all c sort of blended quite well. Which isn't very user-friendly though. I though it was brilliant no? No mine was really helpful as in my stuff was quite helpful I think. I think it depends on the role no? Yeah. But it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole um a whole system  'cause of course they can't give you uh uh anything comparable to the internet for the Yeah  yeah. No. But I think that it it might be to see whether people actually all come up with the same thing. Yeah  like if everyone's given the same input I don't have a clue  anyway. Um what's next? Looks like oh no that's not um It's quite Yeah. Yeah it's all very new  no? It's all very new. Sorry. What what's the end? Are we are we supposed to um you supposed to write a report? Or we ending? Is that the end? End of meeting. You have to tell her  she Okay we have to fill in all this stuff. Stuff stuff stuff. Yeah. Well there's al eight  nine. Ooh. Oh ooh. You could change the vegetable  or fruit. Yeah. It's been a l It's been a little bit difficult to um make sure that it's hand-holdable  and that the user can use it  you know  it's not too big. Uh but we think that this you know  this size will be okay and we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow. And I guess the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was or design yet actually  would be the um thing the locator. How how so Okay so that's just So you have to have a button on your on your you have to attach the button to the Yeah we have that that has yes yet to be designed. Yeah that c hey that that could you know match the handset. You could have a broccoli  or you could have a mango. So. Tada. Mm. Yeah. Is it possible that we can bring this up on our own Is it meeting three minutes? No it's not minutes. Okay. Okay. Cool. True's one and false is seven. So it's actually a scale. Okay. Does it feel fancy? No. Yeah. Okay. One. Hmm. Um three. Yeah. So it's a one was true and seven was false? Okay  so you guys really didn't like it? I was like  why did you guys design it that way if you hated it? Yeah. One. Uh three. One. Uh two. Uh one. Yeah. Uh one. Uh. One. One. One. Two. One. Which one is that again sorry? Three point one? I think What if we just smash all the vegetables down flat? And like then it you could hold it in your hand better. Yeah. The flat one. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't yeah. But like if if you just squash them flat like and you made it flat But it's still too big I think  in your hand. Yeah. Yeah like certain ones you'd have to limit the fruit selection  like you could probably do a strawberry still. I think the broccoli would be out. You could do  although the broccoli is quite comfortable  I have to say  like sorta like a joystick. I don't know. So Uh. Rhubarb. These obscure fruits. I think we needn't Huh? Oh okay. Yeah. That could work. Yeah. Yeah. I dunno. Yeah. 'Cause yeah no-one wants to hold a remote that's uncomfortable obviously. Or like I dunno  some of 'em you can kind of think see as like like you could if it was only this you know  if it was shaped like that  and it just had that. But you see the problem is you have to attach that  and this has to be detachable. So like maybe that's just too big because Yeah it's sorta like a joystick. I dunno. I guess Yeah. Dif Yeah. Yeah. Like uh we could do I'm trying to think of other sha like fruits that are oddly shaped. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. We could tr I don't know. Cool. Well Yeah the broccoli I guess wins. We were a bit off task. Um so uh I can't think of any So we'll have to like Mm. Yeah I dunno. You could make the touch pad in th in different shapes  but then that kind of re-designs the whole project like  but you could do like Yeah that's true. Yeah. Yeah that's true. Mm. Hmm. I did. The prototype making was very creatively stimulating and I think we've come up with a product that's fun and meets all the criteria. I think you were fine. You did a good job leading. Yeah I think it more than anything we didn't really have our set roles so much  as we just would be like I don't know  all had ideas about it but yeah. No. Hmm. I felt like my I dunno if it was just my role  but l but uh I di I thought that my the information that was available to me was kind of just like or maybe it was just the idea that we had. But there's kinda it was kinda like okay  I don't really think I dunno what I'm doing here. So I didn't really think it was helpful. So I kind of just made up my own stuff and I didn't really like the PowerPoint presentations  so I kind of wrote a lot of notes instead. But yeah I d I don't really like PowerPoint personally  think it's kinda stupid. Yeah but uh Yeah. It didn't really yeah. So like a f Yeah I think so. Yeah I mean  it Yeah I kinda thought that um I felt like I would go and like try to use my information  or like I'd make this stupid little presentation and then like I just would end up talking about something completely unrelated because I dunno I felt like I was off-task all the time. But um Yeah. I wanna s I I'd like to see what what it looks like on the Yeah I think I'd like to um I dunno. Like it was the I think the microphones are okay when you're sitting down  but like they're kinda clumsy I guess when you're like when you're s going up to the whiteboard like. Yeah I dunno. But they're they're okay. Uh I think  and I think that uh all this technology like I guess some people must be interested in using it but I can't imagine finding it any more useful than like looking at someone's notes  or like I dunno. Hm. I guess it would be it's gotta be worth it to I 'cause I'm just mostly curious about like what kind of person or like company would would really find it useful  'cause can't really imagine  dunno. How about a p a? Um I dunno. Yeah. M meeting adjourned. I think it would be a good idea  I like it. ,The Marketing Expert presented requirements of users as found in a company market study. The study showed that users want a fancier-looking but uncomplicated remote control  and are interested in speech recognition. He presented the age groups polled and said that the target marketing group should be users aged fifteen to thirty-five. The User Interface Designer presented several competitors' remotes and discussed the features that would make their own device more user-friendly. The Industrial Designer gave a presentation on important internal components that would keep the project within its budget  and discussed possible materials and programmable features. The Project Manager gave several new requirements for the project to the group. The group discussed the features they would like to incorporate into the design in light of the new requirements and budget constraints. They decided to keep speech recognition as one of their components  and decided to include some programmable features  limit the number of button functions  and make the remote yellow and glow-in-the-dark  in an organic shape. The Program Manager said that he would ask to what extent the company motto had to be incorporated into the design. 
Okay. Here we go. Alright  the agenda for thi oh. Alright. Um the agenda for this meeting is um we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers. And then we will evaluate it  given the criteria that um that we gave gave it. And um talk about our finances  whether we were under or over our budget. I have a um a spreadsheet where we can calculate um our prices for every aspect of of what we've made  given our options. And um evaluate the product  as a group. And um So first we'll have the prototype presentation. Do you need the um PowerPoint for this? Alright. On? A mango. Okay. Oh. Okay. Oops. Yeah. Notice you have a number ten button. Okay. No problem. Ah. Oh. You press a plus button? Oh okay. I've never heard of that kind before. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. I But Would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two? Yeah but I mean if you press  it'll go to that channel right away. 'Cause you gotta press the plus afterwards. Yeah I know  but if if I wanna go to say number like sixty five  channel sixty five  if I press the six it'll go to channel six  and then I'll press the plus  and then it'll go to six and then put the five and it'll go to sixty five? I th Um Yeah it wouldn't be a problem. But I was just wondering like as long as we realise that's what it'll do. Yeah. C_ and V_. Right  where um where's the power button? Oh okay. Yeah. Yeah. Oh okay. Yeah. Ergonomic  definitely ergonomic. The spon yeah. Yeah. Bit of a stress ball feel. Yes. I would. My goodness. There you go. Genevieve? Yeah. And something hmm. Oh right. Yeah. It looks more Think like vanilla and banana would. Okay yeah. Kinda Christmas  you know. Yeah. Cool. Alright  thank you very much. Good work everyone. Alright. And so now that we've we have a prototype  uh we need to go over the finances and seeing if this prototype matches uh what our budget can handle. So  I have something I'm going to Oh wait a minute. Do you need to do a presentation first? Yeah. I'm gonna check that out for a second. What time is it anyw Oh yeah sorry you're right. Evaluation criteria is next in line. Yeah. Just press um function eight again. And then again I think. One more time. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Ooh. Yeah. The look is a little bit more playful. Oh definitely different yeah. Oh you were only given red and black? Oh okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. It's mango. It's mango. Yeah. I would say two. Personally. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'd say maybe three. Yeah we want it simple. Yeah. I think so. Yeah. Yeah. One. Th The plus number thing. Yeah colour will definitely be a factor. I think that the logo could be smaller. And maybe not such a prominent way. Maybe like at the bottom  kind of. Oh it just had to be on there I guess. I like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand. Maybe if the bottom was just sort of flat  and then the rest is like round. It would still be comfortable I think. We c we could handle it I think. Ah it'd fall over all the time though. It'd be annoying. 'Kay we're done designing. Come on. I think  it was another colour and it was like I think it'd look okay. I think maybe a two. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Durable. But you're our Marketing Expert. Oh. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. I would give it a two still though. Mm. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We have the alarm system. I thought the light from the inside was gonna light up. Or or was it gonna make a noise? You press the button it makes a noise right? Yeah. Awesome. Awesome. I though w it was gonna make a noise. Okay. Oh okay. Whoo. Okay. Yeah  totally. No problem  mm. Totally. Yeah. Yeah  so it's just like channel six  six  enter. Yeah but you don't have to press zeros. And then like twelve  enter. Yeah. Yeah. I think so. It's like right in the Your thumb might get a little bit uh Yeah. But it is soft. And that's kind of what the um the PowerPoint slide thing said would be good for R_S_I_  so maybe it is but Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes we did. Well  yeah the colours are yellow and grey. So it could be grey on the banana one. Yeah. Mm  yeah. Hum. I would say so. But maybe more like two 'cause there's no like pictures of fruit  it's just sort of naming it by a fruit. With the with the colours. Yeah. Yeah. That's fashionable in itself to have interchangeable plates. Be like Yeah. Maybe if it was scented. Yeah we have money for that. Um Alright so based on this evaluation  do we average them out sorta thing? Oh. I would say two. One point nine or something? I don't know these things. Um  between one and two. Alright. Yeah. I'm attempting to do that right now. Yeah it is one point nine. Ooh. Go Heather Pauls. Yeah. Alright  now with that over and done with  our next step is to see if we are under budget. And um my computer's frozen. And now it's not. Okay. So um in our shared folder  if everyone could go there right now  um I'm going to um steal a cable. Um it's it's um it's an Excel file. Oh. Yeah. 'Kay there we go. Um  production costs. And um I have to access that as well. One moment. 'Kay so far I've added what I think or what is going on? Great. It's blinking at me. It's locked for editing. Read only. I'm gonna open up a second one then 'cause it's locked for editing. I have the original in my um my email account. I dunno. No. No  I was hoping that you guys could. Um  there we go. Okay here we go. So we need to tally up how much our w our product will be costing. So um if you can look up at the screen  um the large screen  oh I guess looking at your own too and telling me which one you think. Okay we're using kinetic which is quite a large expense at three Euros. Um we're using a regular chip. Um  it's cur it's double curved  so its curved all around. That's another three. We're already at five. Um  we're using plastic and rubber  so Good thing plastic is free  we're at eight. Um S Yeah. I guess we should do it just for one kind. So it's like special colour well we'll have two colours right? Well one colour for the case  one colour for the buttons. So we can Um  we have push button interface  so that's inexpensive. And um we have a special colour for the button  and we also have a special form. And a special material. Which puts us just barely under budget. Hurray. Yeah. Good work guys. So um our operating cost is twelve twenty Euros. Awesome. And back to our PowerPoint. So we've 'Kay. Yes we are. So we need to do a product evaluation  again  which is probably um I dunno. A different extension of a Hmm. Yeah 'cause we're talking about leadership  teamwork. Yeah. Alright so um Do you guys feel like there was room for creativity? Pushed for creativity? Ye Okay. So it'd be like need more time and materials. But you were allowed m creativity? I think so as like but you were supposed to have creativ Right. Right Okay Great. Leadership? Is this me being like  guys do you like me? Um. Yeah. Yeah. Oop Okay. Teamwork? I think we worked great as a team. Yeah? Alright how were our means? We needed more Play Doh colours. Yeah. But ever everything else was satisfactory? Is that good Yeah? New ideas found. I don't really know what that means. Hmm? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Each other's Mm. Okay? Well with that achieved  our last slide is our closing slide. Yes our costs are within budget. It's evaluated generally positively. And um don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary. Then we celebrate in such a way that I have no idea. Alright? Okay  bye. Um This is what we came up with. It's a pretty simple design. It's um based on a mango? Yeah. And we Yeah. And we have the company logo here and this will be the infrared here and this'll be the power point  the on off button kind yeah. It's in the middle of one of the little R_s. And then the other one is the power. And uh we just have a simple design. We wanted it all to be accessible from your thumb yeah palm-held and all the buttons are accessible from your thumb. So you don't have to Oh that was a mistake  wasn't it? Right no  that's a zero. Take that one off. Sorry. I was in charge of the numbers. And this is just if you've got like eleven or twelve or thirt the plus. You can go one  three or something. You press that first and then you go one three yeah. Well we just thought  we have all the numbers here  so we wanted something representative of numbers larger than ten and So the plus and then yeah. No no  th all that's why we have all these numbers. These numbers um these numbers all work independently up to nine. Yeah. Oh no. Uh  the plus is only for if you're going past the number nine. You p Oh. No you press the plus first. I I well it doesn't we haven't really s I would've thought you pressed the plus first and then the six five  but she says plus press which what do you think is simpler? It's a Yeah. Yeah. Oops. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So A channel. Just so we can flick It's in the middle of one of the little R_s. Yeah  so it's all accessible. Without m taking your hand off the remote. And it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Of Play Doh yeah. 'Cause it'd be quite subtle and Yeah. Yeah  yeah  yeah. The pomegranate's kinda girly and funky kind of  and then the vanilla's more for the more sophisticated customer who just wants something that fits in with all decor. Yeah. Mm. Well Yeah. Yeah. Yeah so not very sleek and we don't wanna go for black because most remote controls are black or grey. So we want it to be stand out that way  anyway. Yeah. A metallic-y finish we were thinking. Polished. Okay Yeah. We we were we were thinking about yeah. I w I'd say two I think. Fanciness. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. I'll go for three as well. No. Wouldn't be simple  yeah. Yeah. Yeah very. I think one for that. Yeah. No. Yeah that's the only thing yeah. It's definitely Yeah. But the Remember the management said that it it had to be prominent. Yeah. Yeah. But you know what I've just thought of there now. What where's it gonna sit in your living room? Is it not gonna fall off the arm of the sofa? Yeah. But then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand. Yeah. Oh that would be nice. Yeah. Three. You would though  'cause it's bit it's more interesting than other remotes. Yeah. Yeah. I think we have to market it in the right way  that um to say that it is simplistic. So people don't just see it and think  uh  this is so simplistic  I don't want to spend twenty five Euros. We have to market it. And the kinetic energy part. Yeah. Don't shake Oh no the plus. You're use the zero. Make a new one. I think they're about ten po ten pound  aren't they? About ten pounds. Fifteen? Yeah. Mm. Yeah. I think it does very well. The zap yeah. Uh Yeah. Yeah the bu when you press the alarm system  the lights behind the and it'll vibra It'll be again in the marketing. Yeah. The light it will. But But both Yeah. Oh  that would be brilliant. I'd be tempted to Yeah. It would have to be in the market Yeah but you still couldn't see it. It would just be a little speaker on the back or something. So the plu the plus w once that's written down on the page that'll be really simple  won't it? Yeah. That kind of annoys me though  when it's zero six when you have to press I don't know why. Oh okay. Right. Alright  aye. Yeah. I'd say w yeah one. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. But if you're zapping yeah. I don't think it will f Yeah  the biology. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. I I'd say t two. Yeah. Yeah. N We we can't really do that because for example on the banana theme we can't have it as being yellow. It won't stand out. So n it's not always gonna be the same colour. Gray  yeah. Yeah  could be grey. Yeah that's right  we didn't even rea Yeah. Perhaps a metallic or or like that's grey  and it wouldn't be that expensive to have a little bit of metal. No? That isn't rubber. Okay. Following that briefing we did. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think w yeah  I think one. Well that was our brief and we followed the brief. Well we haven't got a big banana but Oh yeah. No. No. Oh that would be class. Yeah. Two. It's Yeah. Close to two. Yeah. I got Yeah  'cause we've a four to bring down. Uh  aye. Yeah. Uh  should've added five. This is. Yay. Is that the project document? Yeah. Oh right. What about a special colour? Are we using that? Yeah. And a special material. Yeah. That's good. Yeah. The ma Or materials. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Creativity. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  it c it might've been bigger. Yeah. I'm actually not sure if I've saved my presentations. Yeah. Through discussion. Yeah. And we were a able to modify each other's ideas to fit in with our areas of expertise. If if it if it If it can be afforded. Yeah. Yay. Yeah. I'm sorry. What was the where's the L_E_D_? Oh. Okay. Oh  there's no e okay. Okay. Sixty. Well the there is a there's a delay on remotes I think. Where you can have it it's like a five second input time. So as long as you hit them dada it should be fine. As long as there's not a big pause between the t hitting the two buttons. Was there so on the top there is volume and Channel up volume up. Okay cool. Yeah. It's the R_. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yes. Oh it's nice. Oh I think I killed the five. I did. I killed the four. Oh god. Oh it smells good. Bravo You want the I don't know what order it goes in. I have one. Evaluation cri Okay. That's me. Hello. Oh there we go. Okay. Come on my computer. Come on. Sorry my computer's giving me technical difficulties. Should I press it again? Last time I did that it sh Okay. You're right. Oh. Still not there. Okay now I think for this one I could Would you guys prefer use the whiteboard or mayb maybe I'll just do it on right on the screen where you can see it. Um  we're gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we've just seen. Um and looking looking back at my notes from our both our conceptual and our functional meetings  um I made a list of what our original requirements and goals were  um  back to our kick-off meeting this morning. Um  and we'll evaluate as to whether we've s done what we set out to do. Um and we're gonna do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false. So basically the lower p the lower the points the better. Okay so question number one. Does the remote whoops. Sorry. Oh I'm not gonna be able um  I'll do it on the whiteboard. I can't change it so I'm g I'm gonna ask you to push it down once. I'll write down our scores up on the Okay so number one. Do we have a fancy look-and-feel? Yeah I guess that depends on your definition of fancy  but it's definitely different. It's not your traditional yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I kinda I like the potato look. It's very different. It's what? Oh sorry the mango the mango look. Yeah it is  fruit or vegetable depends on your mood. So I myself would say a one or a two. It's a two? Okay  and p One being true. So Two. Okay  actu that's pro that's gonna get confusing  like that. Okay so question number two was is it techn technologically innovative? So I know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative. Use of the rubber  the use of the L_E_D_. Isn't Mm-hmm. Yeah. And I think I mean it it's tough to say because we were we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this  because then that would've defeated the purpose. So I mean I we'll put three  but I think we actually reached our goal. We didn't want it any more than that. Okay question number three. Uh  will it be easy to use? Yeah. Yeah. S Yeah I think it's you can't really get confused with that. I mean  there'll be s we have to work out the uh number the plus system. But once that's figured out  it should be fine. Number four. Is this a good-looking remote? Remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly. Mm-hmm. Whoops. Should just not touch it. This time it's the three I killed. I was just wondering if it should be like flatter. Or Well Yeah the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit. Oh. That's true. Maybe  it could it could be on the bottom  so you wouldn't loo like if it's flat here  so it sits up. Like that. I g If it's weighted maybe. Details  details. Okay. So  is this a good-looking remote? Would we wanna show it off to our friends? Yeah. Yeah? I mean I gue yeah  it's personal taste  but Yeah. Okay  so should we say two for that? Yeah? Okay. Uh  question number five. What's um will people be willing to spend twenty five Euros on this product? Remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control looked fancy. Mm-hmm. Yeah it the marketing will have a lot to do with it. Shake it and the buttons fall off. No  I guess  I don't know much about the remote control industry  how much your average sells for  but I know I am  aren't I? But you don't have to buy batteries. So in the long term this can actually save you money. So we'll market it that way too. So yeah I think with a good marketing scheme um and the personalisation options  it'll Yeah. Okay number six. Can someone read it out? Or Um yeah. So that was mainly that the statistics we said Mm-hmm. Yeah I guess the I think the key word there is average  'cause there were some people that used the uh video input and sound and stuff. But they're not you and I really. So. Okay so one? Okay. Number seven. C Heather could you push it down? Will this remote control be easy to find when lost? Remember that fifty percent of users lose their remote regularly. Now is there the is the alarm system still was it implemented? It turns into a duck and starts quacking. Here I am. Um Okay. We oh you're just explaining why it's not on the prototype. But yeah  it'll be there. So we can we could say that We can give it a one  because compared to every other remote ever m ever made  this one will be easier to find. Okay. Um Question number eight. Will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new? Remember that thirty four percent of users usually found it difficult. So it has to be yeah  it's eas they'll pick it up and they'll know what to do. The plus thing needs to be worked on. Yeah. Well Do Does it make more sense for the middle one to be an just an enter button? So then you would have to push two buttons every time at least. You could just press six enter  or one two enter. Yeah. Um  okay so we can we'll say yes it's uh one? Okay. Question number nine. Uh  will it minimise the effects of R_S_I_  which was repeated strain injury? Um  which affected over a quarter of users. S It's soft  and And people could Mm-hmm. I don't know what other options there are. Could I mean  you could hold it in your left hand and d use your index finger. But there's not really any other options unless it's like a keyboard. So  I think we did as as much as you can with a remote control. So  one or two do you think? Two okay. Okay number ten. Did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo? Now is the colour gonna be there even if it's like vanilla? Is the yellow Mm-hmm. It sounds like the colour's something that we But I mean the yell yeah d yellow's ugly though  depending on the So I think we'll have to talk to our executive managers  and see if we can get away with just the R_R_. Okay. Yeah. And the buttons in the middle. Okay. So  do you think that's more of a three then? Three  four? Four? Well we have good reasons for it  so we but we can still put a a four? Okay  and final question. Um  did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics? Current trends of fruits and veggies  desire for sponginess. Yeah. No  uh  are the plates interchangeable? I think I missed a few they are? So you can have banana and kiwi and okay. Okay  so that's something that's kind of in the making too  like maybe it'll become more Mm-hmm. Yes we do. So I wh what was I gonna put for that? A two for fashion? Okay  so our average there  five  six  eight  ten  eleven  twelve  thirteen  fifteen  nineteen  twenty one  divided by eleven is Between okay. Um. Yeah  that's very good 'cause the highest we coulda got is one. Does that seem right then? Okay. Sorry. Are you gonna do that? Okay. Oh is it locked 'cause I'm in it? Or okay. Mm. 'S good. Mm-hmm. Yeah and the conceptual and functional. Like we were very creative in in coming up with an idea I guess  but m When we can down to it. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Good leadership  I think we stayed on task. Mm-hmm. And the timing was good. We never were pushed for time  or sat around doing nothing  so Was good teamwork. I think we are well-suited to our roles. Oh really? Okay. Yeah. The computer programmes are good. The Yeah. I don't think there was anything Yeah. They'll probably still be there. Um I'm not sure  new ideas found. Yeah well I guess we really it we bounced off of each other  which was cool. Like based on marketing stuff and then you'd say something about interface and yeah  worked well. Mm-hmm. Oh does it have smart materials by the way? Does it have smart materials? Oh yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. By watching T_V_? Mm. Conclusion? Dadada. Okay. Um yeah. I just got a few slides  so show them. Thank you. Do you want to present it? Yeah  here we are. Mango shape. The L_E_D_. So it's palm-held. Yeah. You just need the nought. So one plus one would be eleven  or Yeah because if you on your average um remote  if you press one twice you just go to um or uh say you wanted channel twelve  you press one  and then you go to channel one  and then two then you'd just go to channel two  instead of twelve. So if you did like one plus two you could go to channel twelve  or two plus two is channel twenty two. Oh. Well I don't mind  we can further define that. I wouldn't have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first  in like on the way to channel sixty five. But I suppose it's not as snappy. Yeah. Yeah. If you don't put it Yeah. Yeah  that yeah. Mm-hmm. Um And channel  which is so you could just go like that without thinking about it  like It's the bigger R_. So it's just like. We deci Yeah um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers because we thought that's kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb. Uh e ergonomics are all considered. Yeah. It could cause another type of repetitive stress injury though. But yeah  no I mean it's a different movement so yeah. Um and the feel of it  I mean  we've made this out of Play Doh  which is representing the  you know  the rubber  and the spongy rubberness. Um 'cause it was said before in the material specification that this the this anti-R_S_I_ um material is often used in stress balls so this has got a you know a bit of give to it  and it just feels feels different. Would you like to feel it yourselves? How it fits in the palm of your hand? Thanks. And you? O Okay  as for the colours  we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype. But we're thinking that  seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway  that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use. Or the combination. Um and we're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme  the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit  like banana could be black and yellow  watermelon red and green  or vanilla might be the most popular if it just uh blends in more settled cream instead of the others are all a bit garish. Banana's more representative of our colour scheme  like the company the yellow and black. So that for corporate identity that would probably be the most strength. I mean watermelon  you know  m probably appealing to the yeah  seasonal. Apple green  brown  more kinda trendy  you know  khaki Yeah. Okay. Um yeah we thought of the components it was definitely um a focus of ergonomics and just a single ha handheld device  I mean you don't need to use both hands  one hand to hold this and type in with the other  you can just use your thumb. Um  as we said the rubber's probably used for comfort and anti-R_S_I_ and that's about it. Mm-hmm. Mm go Feel I think. We've been quite successful with the rubber coating and Yeah. I think the colour has a lot to do with it. I mean th the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that I think we would've necessarily chosen. It's not the kind of ooh uh at all sleek red  black and yellow  and orange. Um But if you can imagine that in like a s just a maybe uh a kind of pale metallic-y finish or something Well I know know it's for rubber. I mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours I think it would look quite fancy. Oh well  potato  mango  fruit and veg. Potato's fine. Potato's fine. Yeah. Totally. It's really adaptable. For the fancy I uh two  three. Yeah and the use of the rubber. For the anti-R_S_I_. The L_E_D_ use isn't particularly innovative and we don't have any scroll buttons  it's all pushbuttons  there's no L_C_D_ control  so if we're thinking about the rest of the market  it's sort of probably halfway. In some aspects it is  like we said. Yeah. Though it was our specification. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah and perhaps the turning on but Mm. Again I think the colour comes into this. Okay. Not in Don't worry. I suppose I've got quite big hands. Thing is like that  it's not going anywhere particularly. Yeah. Uh yeah  it's less um  what's th ha. H it's got higher centre of gravity like that. I would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that  but definitely in another colour  I'm not happy with those colours. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And the kinetic energy  shaker-style-y  whoo  ooh no. But you know  those'll be firmly on. Mm  yeah  that's true. Yeah. Good point. Yeah. Yeah. Does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user. Yeah. Because yeah  because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the and the channel-changing. And it's just you won't have to think about it. You don't have to look down to find them. They're clearly there  easy to use. Simple. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. It Yeah l lights on and  or flash as well. But I mean it's not obviously obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen 'cause you can't s particularly see an alarm. Yeah. But when the alarm's not yeah. If you Yeah. You could s Yeah. Well the thing is  if it was had an alarm system  I mean  when it when it lights up as we I mean it could light up when the alarm went. But if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something  there wouldn't be any point. So you can't see the alarm  but it would light up. Yeah. Alarm  but you can't see an alarm inside uh the alarm system itself. Yeah. Yeah. It w yeah. Sorry. Yeah. Sorry Heather. That wasn't very clear. Yeah I think just because it's we've decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons  I think that in itself makes it so much easier to use. Mm. And or sixty six enter  y Yeah I think that's probably more straightforward. Yeah. Good Ooh. Mm. Oh. Injury. Yeah  that's what I was thinking. We may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we don't know about. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. I think we're getting that's true. Mm. I think yeah  I think too. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. I think this is the the factor that we've been least successful in confronting. Yeah. Four I think. Well I don't what do what Okay. Yeah. Like um the colour scheme names and stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It is. The thing is  I think if somebody saw that and you said what was that inspired from  I don't know if you'd instantly say mango. Oh yeah. There we go. That would be great. Um Okay. It's Between one and two. So that's pretty fantastic. Mm. It seems like it should be more around two. Do we have an online calculator? Okay. Oh wow. Well done. Well that's excellent. Production costs. It says it I think it just means that we can't add any more to it now. Have you have you completed it? Oh right. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Double double-curved yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Oof. Congratulations guys. Of the actual project rather than the product? A project? Is is yeah. So wh how we actually went round uh about doing it. I think we were pushed. I mean we weren't really given a lot of time  or materials  yeah  to go about our design task. So I think we could've done with a bit more time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well we were just limited by resources really and like if we had decided to use the L_C_D_ screen  and like solar power backup and everything  then we wouldn't have been able to afford that. So that did limit creativity. Just resources. But yeah. The fruit and veg idea. Yeah we did. We've  uh seeing as we've come out with what we intended. A pro um a product within the budget. I think that's a sign of good leadership and also our personal coach helped us along the way  so you know I think it's been fine. Yeah. Good timing. And project manager of course. Yeah. Yeah. Um Yeah and more Play Doh  'cause that was all the red we had. So even if we wanted to make a bigger prototype  we wouldn't have been able to. Yeah. It could be really straightforward for the computer. I think the only thing was having to remember to you know to tick the okays but I think I was the only one who struggled with that. Mm. Uh me too. Yeah. Well I think we've all learnt stuff from each other  like the n um yeah. Just about each different. Got new ideas from each other. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry? Oh yeah. Well mm  did it come into the into I dunno if we counted that in the costs. Yes. Uh. Fantastic. Okay  brilliant. Thank you very much. ,"The project manager stated the agenda and set the goals for the current meeting. The industrial designer discussed different options for batteries  case materials and shapes  chips  and interface components and also discussed the components necessary for a speech recognition capable remote control. The user interface designer presented his concept for the interface design which he called the ""millennium remote control"". The user interface designer also discussed with the team color options and how to make a ""smart"" remote which is in tune with the user's preferences. The marketing expert discussed current findings from trend watching reports which indicated that there is a desire for products to have a fancy look and feel  be technologically innovative  be easy to use  incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme  and be spongy. The project manager gave the team members their assignments and then the team went over the decisions they had made and discussed whether to use titanium or rubber in their design. "
Play-Doh's edible. Did you know that? It's definitely Yeah. It's it's chew proof. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Everybody everybody ready? Okay  let's have your um let's get have the uh presentation? Nice. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. what button? Um. Oh mute. Okay. That certainly does. Mm. Mm. Yeah. 'S great. I have one thing about it  but it's a small thing  but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one. But  that's I don't see why that's not possible. Yeah. They make left-handed scissors  you know. Yes s Mm. Sure. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. But um other than that  I mean uh and that's um  you know  that's just something  I think I think it's great  yeah  great idea. I think it's  well  if the R_R_ motto is  we bring fashion to to electronics  I'd say that could be quite fashionable. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  very good  yeah. It's come up with what we've you know  the things that's what we've what we were looking at doing  hasn't it  all seems to be there. Well done. Um before we move on I need that cable. Thank you. Yeah. Um. One thing I do need to do we need to look at  is the costs. Well  yeah. um Yeah. Uh right. Okay  now I think we'll do this I could do you know  I can do this o on my own or I could do it with you  but it's just easy enough to go through it with you  so we're going for the kinetic power. And the electronics  we decided on it being just a simple  the easiest thing that's inside it. Ooh. So the case  we've gone for the double curved. Um and it's made out of rubber. The interface is push-buttons. And button supplements well they're in diff special colours  aren't they? So special colours. Special form  yeah  they're a special form there in shapes and stuff. Yep. Yeah. Um. Are they made out of any special material? No they're not. They're not made out of wood or titanium or rubber or anything  they're just simple Okay. Right. So let's see if that comes within budget. And it does. That is gonna cost uh Yeah. That's gonna cost ten ten Euro seventy cents a unit to make. And our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty. So  this is all very very good. The bosses will be very pleased. Okay  let's just save this so I can e-mail it to you. Uh. Save it in save it in the uh my documents. Splendid. Okay. So uh  that's done with this with this um doodah  so you're. Gonna do what you were gonna do  your evaluation. F_ eight. I love the smell of that Play-Doh. I cou. I would give it a seven. Oh sorry  one  d yeah. Yeah.. Yeah  but that's not a technological thing  that's another thing  i that's another marketing thing. So on the technical side of it it Easy to use. I'd say it's I wouldn't not if you're left-handed it's not. I would give it a I would give it a two  'cause i i it i it i it is more geared for right-handed people than left-handed people  but Yeah. Give it a t give it a two. Cost. It's come in under budget. So that's a definite one. Amount of buttons. Contains only the necessary buttons. Yeah. So it's anti-R_S_I_. I don't think it's gonna get lost easily. two. I mean it No  I mean I mean  you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically  but Okay. Alright it's all all systems go. We can't fail.. Well done  Reissa. Okay  I I think um I just wanna put in as Project Manager the you know  little bit of praise for everybody here for how they've worked on it  you know  both individually and as a team. You know you've w everyone's come up with their own individual ideas in their own different departments  um and then come together and worked in  you know  integrally  you know  at the right times  psp  you know  especially you two. That's all  you know  gone very very well and and and be you know  has been good communication going on. Did you have to go down to the the corporate squash court and bash a few balls about? Fantastic. I think So I I  you know  and I think we've co we have come we've come up with something new  something that hasn't been done before  we haven't we're not just rehashing an old design. Yeah. You know  maybe this isn't a simulation  maybe this is actually so it's like Sony or someone like that they're they're just  yeah  they get Yeah. Yeah  two years' time this will be on the market. Ex exactly that product um thum we'll go  yeah  we designed that and no-one will believe us. But um No  I think when this meeting's finished like officially  there b we'll get a uh questionnaire to fill in. Or six  uh I haven't got message. It gets handed over to another department. What our what our project was was to come up with the product  basically. the for the and just basically is it it come can is it within budget. When it c when it comes to all the other things of how to sell it and  you know  the b the profits and all that that's other departments it's another team that actually work out the mai the oh yeah  the all the guys in the profit sharing  yeah. Um. Yeah  that's it. You know  we've we've we've made i we've made we've designed the product  we've ma we've got the prototype  it's within budget  it's does everything that we wanted it to do. It's new  it's it's um something that uh that isn't out there already. Yeah. Well  this is very marketable in that it is it's it's something that's kind of new and looks a bit quirky for people who want that  it's that it's um  hang on  I wrote it down here somewhere Oh no I thi I put it in one of my e-mails that I sent off. Um that  you know  it's marketable in the sense that it's whilst all these other remotes uh actually do give you repetitive strain injury  our one does the complete opposite  you know  so that's something that's new  which is one of the criteria they asked us to come up with something with something new. Yeah  and if you're not having a good time with the T_V_  you can f throw it about  you know. It's fine  it's kid proof. Well  you can break the ornaments  but you won't break that. Yeah. So all in all  I think we've done very well. Well done everybody. Um. Drinks are on the company. In the corporate bar that's next to the corporate swimming pool on the top floor that we're that've all just gained access to. Yeah. That's it. Well  as far as I t as far as I know. Um. No. Anyone wanna play I spy? Yeah  I guess. I mean we're gonna get asked to fill out another questionnaire. Um. It's probably gonna be the same as one we've done before. But I'm not the authority to say that it is. Um how does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this? The sort of using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that? Yeah. I thi you know  I'd I'd n yeah  as we said earlier  I've not never seen that before. something that t the whiteboard thingy  that's great. Um  but a p a pen with a camera on it  I don't think it's such a new thing. I mean it's i or in such a new idea. It would be different if it was sort of hand writing recognition stuff  but as it's not it's literally that'll come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. I used to eat it. Yep. We've got a cool prototype. Double curved. Which is ant anti-R_S_I_. Oh right  yeah. Yeah  I know I know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse  and everybody is using right-handed mouse. Imagine d are you right handed? Imagine you're doing it with your left hand  I don't think it's too But we can have both uh Yeah. I think it does. Yeah. There you go. Play-Doh is very cheap. Chew proof. Oh ho-ho. Yep. Rubber. Yeah.. Mm-hmm. A one. Well  the kinetic thing  yeah. Well so the um Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. True. Two. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yes s yeah. It's yellow. Two. T Mm. Mm. We've  we've done well. Well. You know It is. Y Oh really? Mm yep. Cool. Glad to hear that. Yeah. Yeah. I've  I've definitely eaten it before. I didn't know was edible.. Actually that makes sense  because I remember like  peopl I dunno if my Mom ever did it but I remember other people's Moms making like home-made Play-Doh where you just like make the colouring and make some sort of sort of dough. Mm-hmm. Yeah. We've got some. Yeah  it's pretty exciting. So  everything uh that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber  very simple and easy to use  yeah  double curved  um but also something that was gonna jump out at people  something that would be different uh  separate it from the other remotes out on the market. So uh I think if you put this in the palm of your hand  you'll see what a nice thing we have going here. So  basically  if you hold it like that  the one on your thumb  yeah  the thumb button is the power button. Your index finger is channel up  middle finger is channel down  ring finger is volume up  your pinkie is volume down. That's the lock button  has a L_ L_ on it and then the M_ is a mute button. And then it also has digit For muting the uh Um and then then you can also there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want. So it's really basic functionalities as far as what keys are available  but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different. So all the  I mean the important keys are right at your f f you know right at uh at a convenient place for you to to access them. So you don't you Yeah. It should be. And it's also conformable to the size of your hand. I mean if that's too big  it's a rubber remote  so you can  you know change that. So d does that uh what mesh with what you guys were hoping and for and expecting or does it Ah  that's good thinking  yeah. Yeah  if we build rocket ships why can't we build left-handed and right-handed uh remotes. Yeah  I didn't I didn't think about that  but I'd yeah . Uh-huh. Yeah. Do you think it says R_R_? Fashion to electronics. Yeah. Yeah. And it's got the b the black and yellow and blue. Plus red  which is sort of a a fruit and vegetable uh uh. So that's that's our end of things wha uh That's Yeah. The costs  was that what you said? But it's edible. That was the main criteria from the last meeting  it had to be chew proof. Yeah. Yeah  I mean  these these ones on the side are curved kind of  so The buttons are rubber. That's cool. Yeah. Yeah. And we're actua actually making a better profit than we expected. Yeah  have some have some. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. Oh  sorry  one. Yeah. That was our main technological innovation w every everything else was fairly simple  but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new. It's ergonomic  but that's not that's that's a design that's a des that's a design thing  yeah. It's about in the mid in the middle somewhere  maybe  yeah  I dunno. Maybe three  yeah. Yeah. Mm. Okay. If we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then I would give it a one  but otherwise otherwise a two. Yeah. That was great. Yeah. It is very bright  yeah. It's not the kinda thing that's gonna slip like between a couch cushion or something  you know. Maybe it will. Uh. You think it could lost Mm. Okay. Yeah  anything  I mean. Okay. It's bigger than the average mobile  I guess. But  yeah  it can get lost. Yeah. Okay  yeah  two is fine. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah  during our design I mean there was some s some heated heated discussion  but we we kept we tried to keep it cool and and just just We just had to we just had to squeeze our product a little bit and Now you guys have been a a great team. Think we're the we're the envy of all the of all the other R_R_ teams . Yeah I think they're actually trying to find ideas for a ideal remote. So at this stage  I mean  is this the last meeting of the project? We don't uh have another one after it's gone gone to marke market or something? So there's no way to like predict what our 'Cause we had a we originally had a As far as our financial uh um goals  we had a specific number for profits that we wanted. It was fifty mil fifty million I don't remember. But there's not a way to compute that  I mean  since we saved on the on the production cost  do we know how much we're making on profit? Uh. Hmm. But we have a vested interest prof profit sharing. I think actually and one advantage of of this is that after the uh  you know  after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote  you know. We're not we're not you know  tying tying our cart to that one horse. Mm. Mm. Mm. It make watching T_V_ healthy. Uh. Right  you too. Mm. That's it. I guess it's probably better that we wrap it up than have five minutes of silence. Should we call the day then? Uh  right. Mm-hmm. Your moment to shine. Right  I think they do want to do hand writing recognition on that  it's just the first step. I guess we should end this  since we're off off topic. So. Shall we Right. It's Play-Doh. Because kids yeah. But um  it's it's made edible 'cause  yeah. It's made edible 'cause kids eat it  and if it's wasn't edible then Well  normal babies. Oh yeah it is  yeah. Oh yeah. That is cool. What's the big blue thing? Oh cool. And mute. Oh it's so cute. Yeah  but then but then you can learn to use your right h like I was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family  what  they have two remotes? Yeah  I'm sure they'll be able to I mean it's only pressing buttons  you don't have to do anything  you know  extraordinary. I think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so Yeah  it's not Yeah. Have them in stock. Make 'em more appealing as well.. And all the playing around is uh Yeah  I'm just do you wanna plug in? Okay. Mm. Play-Doh won't last very long everybody'll go like  oops  it's gone. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well  they'll buy more of them if you eat them . Yeah. Yeah. It's better for And special material. Well they're rubber  aren't they? We're under budget. It's already saved  I think. Thank you. Mm. Oh  yeah. This is where we all get to I get to write on the  oops  on the board. Right. Oh. 'S function Okay. Mm. Okay. So  evaluation. We're gonna do it all together so we evaluate each criteria. I've got the criterias. And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven  one being true  so it's it's more like it's fits the criteria  and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria. And the criterias are  and I'll draw this up on the board so we have a box. And this is false  this is just like to keep you informed. So seven's here and one's here and then you've got in the middle. So the first criteria. Do you all get what we're doing? Okay  cool. Okay  first criteria  look and feel. So the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about? As it is it colour-wise and is it spongy? So what mark should we give for that? As in it's not. A one a one. So I'll just write criteria criteria one we get one. Second criteria  new technology. Have we implemented new technology? As in the new high-tech So it's. So we'll give it a Yeah. I'd say it's about a a twoish? Two. Three. three. So criteria three is is it easy to use? I think it's a one  I think. Two  so it's But if we make a right-handed and a left-handed then? Yeah. Yeah  okay. 'Kay  criteria four is costs. 's great. Yeah. Like the amount of buttons  'cause people like a lot le like So it's a one? Um criteria six. R_S_I_ is it good against? Yes. Very good. It's one. And criteria seven  which is the last one  does it get lost? Is it easy to get lost? No? But it is smallish. Mm. I think i it would  could be  could get lost. Mm. Yeah. I mean it's not fully it's not fully like you can't say I mean  it's not a one  definitely. Yeah. The mobiles get lost all the time. But then you ring 'em and you find them. So Yeah. So  that's that. So that's the evaluation  so I'd say Yay. It's like like a number one. Um. Number one product. All done  thanks. We fitted all the criterias. Yeah. Yeah  so So that's that one. been cool. In four diff in in four meetings. Funny  all designer meetings could be this quick. They're using our ideas. Yeah. Just start summarising now. You can reply to the same message. See summary  there. If you just reply to that one. Was it was it fifty or five? Depends how much we sell. We finished an hour earlier. Mm. Mm. Definitely. Yeah. Just don't sh don't throw it at any of the ornaments and break them. No. Yay. Yep. We haven't got the five minute left thing yet. Mm mm. In project. I love it. I love it. I think it's cool. Being all wired up and a vibrating pen and it's cool. Being watched. Um Wow. Mm. Logitech. Yeah. Meeting adjourned. ,The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented their prototype for the remote. The prototype was yellow and red and was shaped like a mushroom. The team then conducted a product evaluation of the prototype. Overall  the team found the prototype to be technologically innovative but had some issues with the prototype's appearance and its usability. The team decided that the prototype required further work. The team then discussed the production costs of the remote and what features they should retain or lose in order to maintain their target cost. In discussing the production costs  the team settled on what features they wanted in the remote  while staying within the boundaries of their budget  and decided it was not necessary to completely redesign their product. The team then engaged in a project evaluation in which the team discussed the process of creating their product. 
Uh 'kay. So Yep. Okay so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product  'kay? And here's the agenda for this meeting. Uh I'm just gonna open  say a few boring words to start with again  and start taking minutes afterwards. You guys are gonna give us a presentation of our wonder product that I can see some demonstrations of over there. Looks cool. And then we're gonna evaluate it. Then we're gonna talk about finance  and I've got a lovely Excel spreadsheet that I knocked up in the last five minutes for this. And uh yep. And we're gonna evaluate the product and close. Got forty minutes to do this in. We should be fine. Let's try and keep this one on schedule. So Your thing is in where is it? Is it in Who wants it? Zapping your favourite channels  eh? Oh okay okay. Ah 'kay okay  that's favourites. Ah 'kay. I like the the the the logo on there as well. It is very prominent. So this is the Okay. Ah  okay I see. It's pretty cool. Is that could that be easy to for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it? Oh well I guess it depends on the stiffness a little of it. Mm. Feels good. I take it that this is gonna be slightly lighter in the final design as well. Yeah it's kinda cool. You have to reach a little bit don't you. Ah yeah that wouldn't make sense. It's cool. I'm impressed. And hold it so wh what's the marketing perspective? Okay. Mm it's impressing. So let me get it  if I press this button I see. That's pretty cool. Hang on. I plan to do that as well. So the the two blue are are those for the the it to charge off of in? Ah okay okay. Yeah it's the right shape isn't it? But maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling  'cause then it would need to be hit on both sides. Okay. But it's definitely got options for like different types of models and things as well based on that  hasn't it? So is that the the final colour scheme as well or? Okay. The hmm. It came off. The scroll wheels  a problem with them not being sort of I don't think the user interface guy wants to touch it anymore. Mm. Okay enough of that. Well i it's cool guys. 'Kay so are we done with the this presentation? Okay. Now now. Have you? Okay. Can I not get your get at stuff from your shared folder now? Oh I see I see. Do you would you a argue that that we're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could  but lowering our profit margins? Mm-hmm. Mm 'kay. And we're actually quite open to be able to expand the product for a later version with those features quite simply anyway  aren't we? Th there's no fundamentally different technology to do that. Hmm. Yeah  the plus there's the the risk of making it unusable as well  or making it less b because at the moment it's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons  you know what they do  it's very simple  and it just works. Mm there's a risk of that. Okay so we can talk about finance now. So I have a little spreadsheet for us where I I was wondering  you when you talked about the fifteen point eight Euros  I was wondering how you came up with that figure? Okay so I have bit of a spreadsheet here for this. Now I've made a f few assumptions here in that I'm assuming that our power adaptor we can make for a cost of four Euros  equivalent to solar cells  which I think is probably fair considering that we have in-house manufacturing of power adaptors already. Uh and I'm assuming that the locator beacon  the you know the Can be made for it sounded different that time uh can be made for a similar price to uh an L_C_ display  uh an uh Uh do you think that's fair coming from a m the manufacturing?. Okay. Yep. Okay. So we're down to sixteen point four  yeah. Is that a single-curved rather than a double-curved? We're not entirely sure what single-curve versus double-cur You think? Okay I'm convinced. But we save one Euro that way  yeah? So we come bring it down to Fifteen point four. Well hang on. Do don't speak so it's in here  in that w do we have any we have special form don't we? So that's yeah. But the the the we haven't talked about any special colour though uh I don't th if we're going for greys and silvers then I don't think we're O okay so we're Push-button  scroll wheel  we're basically we have uh th is this intended to be a button as well or just a scroll? Just a scroll? It's not one of the scrolls where  for example  with this one you could push it down to be a button? Okay then we have fifteen point eight Euros. It wasn't bad. Okay so we're on to the We're on to the pat-on-the-back part of the presentation  where we have a look at the criterias th that Paul the criterion criteria that Paul has has given us  and we can use that to tell How's it going? Anyone got any thoughts? How how have we done today? I think we did pretty well too. That looks pretty spectacular. Any other chang uh thoughts? Okay so th th what about um room for creativity? Is it the. I I think we we ended up being quite creative there. Mm. Not every idea necessarily  it's still a remote control. Uh no yeah but we did we did break with the specs a little bit I guess  but the uh 'Kay leadership  what do we report back to the bosses? No th th I think they were r reasonably flexible with us over the whole changing the specs thing. I agree. Synergy. Teamwork  yeah he is uh. What did we think of the meeting room  I guess is an important thing here. Mm. Yeah  this falls off and uh the white board worked really well without any pro Mm-mm  lapel. Wha okay  oh  alright. That's it's down  it's quite close. Keep it  keep it calm. Oh dear. No more pizza for me. So yeah the the pen came in alright and it's a little uncomfortable to use but I guess it works. Nah  I'm I'm not convinced of that at all. I've been wor I've been wondering about that all day  but see these look like they're that looks the oth that looks like it would be that way around  but it feels more comfortable  wh what you call upside-down. I don't care. Uh okay so that data might be slightly invalid. What new ideas have we found? Well let's do both then. Uh for the product? Yeah we came up with quite a bit. And for the meeting room  Has anyone got any more Yeah less sore on the ears. Okay so Are the costs within the budget? Nope. Oh hang on it really that's something we that the costs were under twelve fifty Euros. No requirements are changed. We're still under twenty Euros to build  so we're good. And the costs within the budget? Not the original budget  but they are now. Is the project evaluated? Mm I think so yeah  then celebration as it says. Oh I don't know how that got there. Uh anyway. Thank Thanks guys. Yeah  I've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on too. Oh. Put on your mic. Boss. Yep. Alright. Three  three. Pedro can have it. I like I'll help talk. Unit price. Scrolling through your favourites list. It's very prominent. So here I'll give you the so this is the cradle unit  and this is the actual remote itself. Um so the scroll bar is or the scroll wheel is this this green little scrolly guy here  um and then the volume controls are here and here. Uh you've got the keypad which is the numbers uh f from zero to nine and then ten. This is the power button. Uh we have our um we have the enter button and uh what was the other button here? This is the teletext. The programme button  yeah the programme button. So this bl this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming your uh the um the type of television you wanna use. So um the plastic is the white area of this of the model here  and the red area is like a rubber covering. So you can see that when it lays like this or like this and the buttons are all gonna be rubber  so it's pretty hard to actually damage it um Yeah that might be a possible a mi uh possible problem  but if you drop it yeah. Yeah and it depends on if it's sliding  but I think it's pretty ergonomic. You can feel it. Yeah of course. Well this is clay. Yeah the the power button is a bit of a reach  but I think we might scale down the final model a bit. These this is a bit larger than it would be  but Mm Pedro can demonstrate the the paging ability. Beep beep beep. Um beep beep beep so beep beep beep beep beep beep be shut up. Beep beep beep okay. Um no no no tha that's alri Exactly that's exactly what those are for. And um there's one other feature that we were debating  but we decided to go against it  is um you could beep beep beep we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger it it's it kinda feels like there should be something there  but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there. And we we don't wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so Mm. Right. So maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit  but Mm-hmm. Oh no this is just what we had to work with at the time. So we'll leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people. Careful. Beep beep beep. Yeah. No way. Beep beep beep. Mm-hmm. Well  that was just just our technical team added up the um production costs of the individual units. Oh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah. Oh  sorry. Yeah um I do think we that we we uh don't need the events chip on print  we only need the uh the regular chip on print  so there may have been a m miscalculation in there. And we and we have a single-curved uh Uh I think that It's single-curved  yeah. See it's a little bit more than f single-curved. So yeah it's fifteen point eight  that's where we came up with it. Okay. Yeah we do. Ah. What do you know. Oh it's a that's not very special  it's pretty If th. That's a scroll. Uh no we just use it as a scroll. It was a pretty accurate estimate I would say. Yeah. S 's kind of s frighteningly accurate. What? I think we did pretty well. Sh I think there was plenty of room. We got a couple innovative i Couple innovative ideas. Mm-hmm. Yep. There was a lot of synergy. These cables suck. Yep. Yeah. Lapel. That's our boss. Pedro's right. Pedro's right. Oh wel Well we had the favourites list  and the scroll bar  and we have the cradle  and the r uh remote call feature. All right. Good job guys. So you forgot how this works again? Boss. Hmm you knocked it up? Thi third third third. The end product thingy. Yeah.. Um yeah so what we ended up with. Production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and um the research department  which is us  is uh fifteen point eight Euros  someone forgot the units there yeah  uh unit price unit production price cost thing. Um we implemented the basic functions  which is just T_V_ functions plus the locator  which was one of the marketing things  cradle  scroll wheel for uh the the channels  and uh we implemented the f the the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping  your favourite channels functionality  in the scroll. Yeah. Zapping you know zapping. Maybe it's just a Portuguese thing. And um yeah that was the result. Start s the the start uh to to to programme yeah. Not helping. Don't have no one to handle that. Yeah. So you ha you have like the the base station with um the little button for the where's my remote. The locator function. Wicked isn't it? Ja. Nah. It fell off. W we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff  but We we w yeah we could get another version of it that actually works. But uh Very co very colf colourful. beep beep beep. Yeah. We don't It's a scroll. Yes. We're wicked. Awesome. Yeah. Yeah. That was mm-hmm Yeah. No. Yeah. Basically. It was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was Teamwork. Yeah. And that's D you must have very long shirts. That's way far down lapel mic. Lapel lapel lapel. That's almost a crotch mi cr Oh dear oh dear. 'Cause this is you were using it o upside down. Still that Use them like that. Bunch of new ideas. Yeah comfortable headsets would be nice. Mm. Coulda been worse. Mm n no. Hooray. Free coke provided at the cafeteria. Who wrote that one? Cool. So so so. Maybe. Maybe maybe maybe. Bra Mm that's oh that's oh I like it. I mean you guys gave me more than I was asking for  so I'm happy because we've got some really marketable features in this. Yeah I think it's good. Good good good job. Uh pla I'm ha It's great. That's great. It's a great feature. So you can take this ho take this home with you tonight and you can push that and he'll be across town Uh  I can see that. Yep I like. Good job. No no. Well I mean of course  I mean My my s my suggestion is we're gonna go go to the silvers and blacks like most of the televisions. You know some blend of silvers and blacks. So you're not gonna find my uh my folder up there I gotta do mine up at the board. Yeah yeah. So No it's not in there because I had the computer problem and I I I cou I couldn't create it. I couldn't create it in the PowerPoint  and I think I've got this really strange cable. So what I had  basically going from the PowerPoint format  is that uh yeah yeah I like this a lot. Is this one of the tests is to see how we can adapt to s changing situations in the in the meeting room? So what we had is we had the method. That's not how you spell method  is it? No A_.. So this doesn't go so fast this way. And when I speak about method I speak about the marketing of the product huh. And uh to me with this product we got uh we got basically three things to market. We've got the features  we have the uh characteristics  and we have the I I don't know what we would call the other part what we call you know the the the corp corporate Help me. The the corporation stands behind the product  okay. So the features I think we got the scroll  we've got the uh the locator  we've got the durability  we've got the dependability  we've got you know the features that make this a unique product. Um the characteristics I talk about  we have reliability  we have comfort  we have ergonomics  we have environmentally s sensitive. Uh and the corporation  we're talking about we're we're a new we're a new company. We're wanting to make a name for ourself. We're wanting you to uh find our product so we're gonna give you a good product at a fair price. One thing I would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product  a normal use guarantee  which means that this product  for the for the life of of the life use  if it should have a technical problem  that we could re replace it at no cost? That was something I would be interested in. Um so yeah without uh going into great details  we have a we have a product  it has the features and the characteristics  and the background  I believe  to make it marketable I believe at a cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty Euros. We're gonna be competitive  and we're gonna we're gonna have a market niche. Um w That that would be uh that would be I think a decision best made by corporate um I I m for my evaluation  based on what our competition is  I th I think that that we can go after this and and and go after more of the uh exclusivity sense than the mass market sense. But I'm sh I'm sure open to to market this in either direction. But you guys came up with a great product  and at that cost I think it uh there's nobody else that's putting this this combination of of ingredients together. The only limitations I see to this is that we're focused on television only. Uh that's the only that's the only drawback I see to this. But with all of these other features I think people c one thing I'm I'm hoping for is people are not gonna even notice. There's gonna be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesn't work for my D_V_D_ and my but I like these other things  so they keep it  they don't take it back. Well one of one of the thoughts that I had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable? You know uh like like a um a sim card in a in a um in a telephone. You know is there a card in th can we make a card and so after Mm-hmm  but you follow what I'm s I'm s Yeah 'cause if if we can make this unit upgradable then we're yeah but then we talk about changing the warranty concept and everything  but that's that was just an idea I had. Uh to me the only additions Yeah. Yep. But anyway that's uh Mm-hmm. We've got a we've got a curve and a droop. I don't know whether that. Ooh. No  I think we come up with a with a attractive marketable um product and and concept. Yeah well we we we kinda broke we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us because we d we still have the the teletext capability in this thing right  we raised the price of it  we've added two t new technology to it. So you know you know if this thing flies then we've we've adjusted or broken every every idea they gave us. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. But I like I mean when I say we have we had I believe we have room for creativity 'cause w this is we did it. Cohesive yeah. Yes synergistic yeah. Yeah. You know you know what they're gonna have on the recording in there from that microphone is your lunch digesting you know th New ideas f uh for the product or for the the the the environment or what are we ta Oh. Well I I mean clearly remote control microphones would be the would be a nice solution to all these cables  but I'm sure that there's there's some justification for these things that I don't know about. And of course I did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon. It's not been uh it's not been cooperating so well  but I don't think that's the that's avoidable. No. Okay. So we need to close this meeting  yeah bravo. Congratulations. S I've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on so let's close this and come back and 'kay. ,The project manager opens the meeting by going over the minutes of the last meeting. The interface specialist begins her presentation by highlighting important remote functions and showing examples of remote interfaces. The group comments on her presentation  and then the industrial designer begins presenting. She talks about the technical electronic components of the remote  explains how a remote works  and shows a few pictures revealing the insides of a normal remote control. She suggests giving the remote a strong shell so it is durable  using a rechargable battery  and not adding a scroll wheel because it requires a sophisticated chip. The marketing expert presents  talking about user preferences for a small  simple  eye-catching  cute  appealing  and functional remote. Fruit and vegetable shapes are popular this year  so a soft  spongy remote perhaps covered with cloth could make the item marketable. The group discusses the issues surrounding speech recognition  noting that if it is good quality it could be costly. They about the power source and review the objectives of the product. The project manager closes the meeting by telling each member what task she is to complete. 
Is that for us? Okay. Yeah  shall I show? I'll show. Though do you do you wanna do you wanna sh do you wanna hold it and I'll I'll show you the presentation. Can I just nick your Whoa. Going a bit crazy over here. Thank you. Okay  so this is our look and feel presentation  the final our final presentation. And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've uh come up with over there. Um It's gonna have a a plastic body um with a sort of standard colour  either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something. This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing um which there'd be sort of a wide choice they would be attached  but we can we can come up with that. Um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns  so you've got you've got a lot of customisation with it. Um it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design and uh the um the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um how do you say  it's yeah yeah  it would be sort of inset into the into the top and the buttons at the bottom would d so so it'll fully close flat. Yeah  yeah. And working on the inside we've um already said d decided on the kinetic batteries  which actually  thinking about it now  could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well  so that you could probably get a bit of Yeah. Yeah. Um we decided that um the voice recognition system  it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of  so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap. So you'd have something like where you'd shout out  where where is the remote and it'll shout back  I'm here  or something. And then yeah. It wo it won't shout out I'm here or something. It'll just shout out I'm here  or something to similar effect. Uh yeah  if it was going like I d well tha that could be something for next time  maybe. You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is. Um the standard  there's be a standard transmission with the T_V_ using using all the standard chips that we've talked about. Um it would it would have obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers  it would need two separate P_C_B_s  so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling. And uh because  obviously  all T_V_s use this  the same infrared medium  we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data. And the infrared um sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer  just at the front of the we haven't I don't think we actually put it on. Yeah  yeah  something like that. Yeah  on the front on the front side of that  yeah. So when you've actually got it open  it would be facing the T_V_. And then finally um on to the interface. The top screen  as we said  is would be an inset um black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen which yeah would uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it  uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons  like the vo volume up and down  channel up and down  power on and off  and uh things to that effect. And now we've we also decided on the inside  we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it  or something inset  or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top. No d not not actually. No  not uh interfering with l the whole look of the the product when it's uh on the thing. And finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics  as that is that's the company logo. There you go.. Yeah. Yeah  okay. Yeah. Yeah  I'd uh yeah I'd probably put it uh two yeah  two or three. No  three. Three. Mm yeah. Yeah  yeah. I'd give it a one. No  no  not at all. Yeah. Two. Two. Yeah. D_. One. Yeah. Yeah  that's No  no  the the base colour was um white or or like or l sort of a light blue  but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised. Yeah  yeah  yeah and No  no  'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it  that otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic. Yeah  I'll give it a one as well. Yeah. Mm. No. Yeah. It's meant to be. Yeah. Yeah  I'd uh I'd f I'd go for a five  actually  'cause Yep. Yeah. Yeah  it was it was uh a voice voice recognition  yeah. Yeah  yeah  that yeah  that's feasible. Um I think it would r I think it would probably be a a stand it would be a stand it would be quite loud. So it would be s p yeah. Yeah. Yeah  one. I do realise that we might be being fairly biased  'cause it is our product  but W I thin yeah  I think yeah. Mm. No. Yeah. It was a regular chip on print and Oh  no  no  no  the um Yeah  it's you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells  there should just be one. In the top  it's the number of c yeah. Yeah  and yeah  just a no  one reg v uh Yeah  one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker. And they're double curved. No. Y Two  'cause it's two. Yeah  I'd say I'd say it was w yeah  I think I think it's One double-curved. And one no  'cause one yeah  one's double-curved  and then the other one's a plastic. Yeah. And special colour. Yeah. Yeah. No  no  that's it's as an extra. So that shouldn't that shouldn't be actually on there  because that's not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get. Yeah  okay. Yeah  the push-button's one and L_C_ display one. And buttons Well yes. Yeah. No  we'll have No  no  you've got to click off to calculate it again. C it might uh you might you might be assuming that that is in Euros. It could be in Dollars. And then it would be fine  because the exchange range would make it about twelve. No. Yeah  the standard  it um it would make one difference. The biggest one would be taking away if you took away If you to Yeah. If if you take away the voice  I I do I don't like to say it  but if you take away the voice recognition  then you've got it. Yeah i yeah. No 'cause it's samples sens sample speaker. If you took away that  that'll make it twelve point three five. They n n yeah  but you p minus three plus two. Yeah. But they but I mean in I don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now  because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product. Yeah. We c we could s Yeah  we could say Yeah  I s And then say we recommend Yeah. Yeah. That'll do it. Twelve point three five. Is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty? Ah. Okay. Yeah. No. 'Cause that that was just a bought-on extra  you could just take that out and that would be fine  yeah. Yeah  I think that's brilliant. Yeah. Yes. Yeah  I'd say  as a team. Yeah. Find out from each other  yeah. Yeah. Yeah  no  I thought it it went really well and I yeah  I I feel that everyone was listened to and all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out  although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there  but that's that's good. I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out  I think maybe it would've come out a d little different  but yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah  well. Discuss which ones yeah. Yeah. Yeah  I think I think we probably woulda used the outer email system more  had we actually had had more time and if we'd been separated more. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Vegetables. Yeah. No. Yeah  I do I don't think the the companies are really concerned. They're just like we've got a D_V_D_ player  does anyone remember the remote control? Can't you get the one that we used for the last one? Yeah  just jazz it up a bit. Uh d they don't really think about it  because normally  the remote control isn't the product which they're trying to ship. They're trying to ship the D_V_D_ player  the video player  the T_V_. Yeah. Yeah. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Well. I think that was just the the physical. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  I think yeah I don't from the market research. No. Yeah  it was I it's top secret. Um it's it is it's a conspiracy going on here. That's what it is. In your yeah. Okay. Is that it then? Awesome. Was that not the questionnaire for the how you felt you'd done in your thing? I don't think. Yeah  the the s yeah. I think yeah  questionnaire seven was the one I did just before the meeting. Mm. Is that someone's? Okay. Or something. Well done. Certainly. Logged in? Thank you. Oops. Okay. This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research. So this is the first stage of the evaluation. Now  the collection of the criteria  as we saw in our previous meeting  was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company. So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting  are we actually meeting those trends and requirements? Now the findings that we came up with  just a recap  are here. The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel  technological innovation  it should be easy to use  it should incorporate current fashion trends  and those the two main ones  they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours. The design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there  though that did seem to be the favoured strategy  but there was also  on the sideline  the though of maybe having a beeper function. Okay  so we can come back to that slide  if you don't have a note of those. I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this  to what we have so far. We're going to use a seven point scale  where one is true and seven is false. We look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned  I'll call that slide back up  and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here. Does that seem clear? Any questions there? So we're going to look at these crite Yes  we're going to come to w we'll discuss each one and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven. Is that okay? One is true  seven is false. Right. So I won't write all of that out again. It will just be criteria one  two  three  four  five  six  or A_  B_  C_  D_  E_  F_ to confuse it with the number rating. B_  C_  D_  E_  F_. This is where I realise how tiny I actually am. Criteria and rating. Actually  it might be an idea  if we each did give our own individual rating  and we could take an average at the end. How about that? Okay. So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques  and if we go one  two  three  four  we know who's who. Okay. Criteria A_  the fancy look and feel. How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy it is a fancy look and feel. One is true  seven is false. My own rating for that would be a two. One is true and seven is false. I'll just go this way. Two. Okay. Two. A four  okay. Adding those up  we've got a six and a five  eleven divided by four is what? Uh two and three quarters  it that right. Two and three quarters? Okay. Two point seven five  there we go. Okay  criteria B_  criterion B_  technologically innovative. I would give that a three. Okay. Not that you're biased in that it the designer. The average oh  for you? You want your rating to be a two? Is that what you're saying? Okay. So  I'll work out the average for that again at the end. It's a very slightly altered Okay  and we're just waiting for your rating f Two point five  okay. Losing one decimal place  that's okay. So what are you rating for this one  Paw? Two  okay. So that is eight. That brings it down to two  nice and simple  yeah. Okay  ease of use. Easy to use? Based on what you've said there  I would say a one  true. Two. A two  okay. Two. I should've said a two to make the arithmetic easy  shouldn't I? We'll just put almost two  because I'm not gonna get into silly decimal places. Okay. Or we or if we want to really bring it down  we can do later. Um mm now we're looking at it incorporates current fashion trends  now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours. Right. So I'm just thinking  before I give it my rating  you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here. Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use? Right. So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do. Okay. And the spongy feel is no problem with that. Okay. In that case it's got to be a one for me. Yep. Everybody? Okay. That part was nice and easy. Okay. Uh moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury. I don't think we've really touched on that a lot. We've we've discussed it  we haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that. We've talked about pointers  but the very use of a remote control  if you're someone who's zapping  who's sitting like that  and we found so many people did  how do you minimise that on such a small device? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Right. Right. I think I'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four. A five  okay. Four and a four okay. Twenty one is that twenty one? So that's four point two five. And finally  last but not least  easy to locate. Now we talked about voice recognition  we talked about a beeper  have we really have the designers come to any dec real decision on that? It was the I'm here thing  yep. And are we happy with the costs on that? That is going to be feasible  cost-wise. That sounds good then. I'd go for a I ca we can adjust the volume on that  just as we could volume on T_V_. So if sombody's in the other room or if T_V_s in different rooms  or. Right. Okay. You built into the feature. Okay. Logical. That's a one for me. One and one  good. So  how do we feel about this? We've got our our we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there. That is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate. The lowest rating we've got  which is really n it's not terribly low  i it's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury. Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it  or do we have to make further modifications? We happy to go ahead? Yeah. I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that  and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities  we could actually do much more to minimise that. I know. Okay. Well  I hope that's uh clear to the team. Is there anything you would like to to ask me about the findings before I sum up? Good. Fine then. I'll just leave it there. Oops. Oh yes. Yes. But it has a slightly flattened bottom so it can sit. So it can rest. It would just be a flat bottom with one curve. like a domed thing. Mm. The other curves at the sides  but it's slightly flattened at the bottom so it doesn't roll over. Yeah. What does it mean if you put point five for that? Mm-hmm. Right  okay. But it is gonna be part of the total cost  and there's nowhere else we can we can put that in  is there? There's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing. So do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there? Okay. Mm. Might do  if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours. S Has that not made any d if you click off that square now  has that not made any difference? Is it oh  it's brought it slightly down. So is is uncurved completely and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing  is that going to make a difference? Oh  it's not made any difference  has it?. It's gone up again. Oh. It's brought it down slightly. Is there anything on the menu No. If we tr um. If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries  would that make a huge difference? And people are used to buying batteries  they're not gonna say I'm not getting this  'cause I've got to buy a battery for a remote control. Should we see what difference it makes? Um Yeah. Sure. But we're still working to um head o We can put in our recommendations. If we if we're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team's working for  we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings. But we need to work to that specification to start with. And I think the voice recognition sounds wonderful  but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is gonna make it easier to locate as a f you know in a first instance. Um as you say  we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers and so Mm. Yeah. 'Cause we've done all the background work to go for that if they want it. Yeah. So if we take voice recognition out we are. Are you sure? Sorry  not meaning to doubt your words there. Right. Are they really going to quibble about ten P_? Or point zero one of a Euro? Which is less than ten P_. That's today's kick off meeting . Mm. I thought that's what it was. So we're okay. Although we had our separate tasks  there was so much interaction  so much that we needed to um bounce off each other. And I've certainly felt heard  listened to in that in relevant areas we've been able to  you know  give and take and adjust our remit where necessary. Yeah. Maybe we should think of branching out into children's toys and fake mobile phones as a side line. And fake R_C_s. How do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information? Could it've been better  was it adequate? Mm. Yeah. Yeah. It's really borrowing from other areas  it's  you know  bringing things from other areas in  it so it's I mean nothing is new  but it's applying it to a d in a different area. Absolutely  yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  the focus isn't on to that  yeah. I think it's really good that this has been very market research based  because just going back to mobile phones  I mean this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really  you know  say is is obvious and visible. We see it in mobile phones a lot  and tha that's where we've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from. There are innovations in that that people don't really want. I see people wanting a model of the phone they were really happy with  and they can't get it anymore and it's innovation for innovation's sake  and I think it's wonderful our company's so R_ and D_ based. Yeah. But forcing it onto people  yeah. It's things that  you know  they might want to buy the thing they really want. Mm. Mm. Or there isn't a cover to fit it or whatever  yeah. See I think I think it was just the produc uh just the production cost of the phone. Mm-hmm. But I think in the remit that we were given  it was very specific. I think we've done what we were required to do  and I think there'll have to be another project team or a new project for us to look at at those kind of things. I don't think that's something we have to look at and find a way of raising the cash for. I think we've done very well to get within budget and it still makes such an innovative item that I think people are really gonna want. I know. Maybe it will. Maybe they are gonna steal our ideas and sell it. Mm-hmm. Questionnaire. Questionnaire done. Oh  I didn't have to rate you on how much you influenced the meeting this time. Oh  right. But do we not sometimes evaluate in these meetings too? Yeah. If you leave them on the whole time you get to look like a noodle the whole time. Is that. three  apparently. Okay  you all switched on. I presume we're good to go. Okay  um minutes um we decided to use a kinetic charger  standard chip  um 'cause it can come in various different sizes  it wasn't uh uh gonna be a problem factor. We wanted a stand-by function. The case material is gonna be soft  rubbery  changeable. Um buttons with a combination of L_C_D_ and rubber according to the design. Um bright funky designs inspired by fruit  keeping with the hip kind of feel. Um and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that. Um and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-R_S_I_. Okay? Prototype presentation. I think that would be you. Make sure the camera's Yes  yes you can. Wait a second  I'll get it out. Um Okay. You should have one of those things and you can just take it off. Ta-da. Right. Mm 'kay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm. So it's flush. Oh right  okay  yeah. So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections  'cause it's the top part that's okay. Okay. I'm under the sofa. Or  that would be too complicated. Infrared. Like here. Okay. Actually  no  it would be it would have to be on the on the front. Oh right  yeah  okay  yeah  I've got you. It's still pointing  yes. Yeah  that would make sense. Okay. But not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product once it's Okay. Thank you very much. Wrapping it all up  okay. Um I've now got evaluation criteria. It's to be presented. Okay. It's quite similar to what it was before  though. Sorry. Mm-hmm. Okay. Just write small. Yeah. That works. Mm-hmm. I would agree. Okay. I would say two. A two. It's just two point five for that one. I would say a two. I would say a two. One point seven f five. Okay  mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. One. Well the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half  the material  minimises R_S_I_ it's meant to. Um maybe because it's slightl with the size that we've got it's quite small  but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much. So maybe because there's more space  it's not kind of moving around trying to hit accurately the buttons in between. It's quite obvious just big buttons. Um Four. A standard. It would be. And if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in  then you'd realise that it wasn't in that room  you'd go into another room. One. I don't think so. I think we yeah. I think we're set. Do much apart from having a huge big Don't think so. Okay  thank you. Okay  I've got finance here now. I'm gonna plug this in so you can all see it  if that's okay. Um. Thanks. Right. Now I presume that the screen will go blank  that um Okay. We just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value. So are we still on for kinetic? Okay. See  it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning. Um it might have influenced our choice. Right  what's happening with the electronics? Double-curved. Oh  right  okay. Thanks. So  would there be two? One chip. Okay. One double curve. So what's a single curve then? So just one double Yeah. Um Mm. Um we've got plastic and rubber  haven't we?. Um Do you think? Okay. It would be like saying we're using See  it says case material. So we're not actually using plastic in the case  are we? It's including  it's including. Okay  we'll just put it in as we'll put in as half. Or sh we should just put it in as one  because the plastic is zero anyway. No  we don't step on anyone's toes. Okay  special colour  do we need that? N yeah  okay. Interface. Buttons Has that not gone up? Oh no  it was seven five it's changed not a lot. Oh  it's not calculated it. Okay  there we go. It's not a lot though. We haven't been dealin we haven't been dealing with dollars though  I think Okay  so the highest we've got is the electronics here. Um and the interface. Where's the where's the voice recognition? Right  okay. Well the kinetic is three. If we change it to the battery it's that's minus three. Oh  right. I keep seeing zero. Um We can do it some other way  we can do it doesn't have to be voice recognition. We could do the voice recognition for  you know  business class or something  you know  like an upgraded version. You could choose to have that or not. So should we just change the design specification then? Yes. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay  we can make the price fit  and then say if we'd had our budget  we would've had this  because it also sets it apart from the crowd. They like their gadgets  they like something that's completely different. It's s something completely different associated with your company. Right  okay  so It's two point five. No  it's twelve point two five. Yeah well two  twelve point two five times two is twenty five  isn't it? I think the agenda one was where the um price was  wasn't it? No. Twelve point five. Well done  people. So is that uh got us covered for the electronics then? We don't need something else to take that place? Okay. Okay. Right  so we've done that. Okay. Product evaluation. We've done room for creativity  haven't we? Because we've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't didn't feel able to make. Um I presume we discussed leadership and teamwork. um in the sense that um did you feel like a team? Or did you feel like uh autonomy? Mm-hmm. Thank you. How did you find it? Yeah. Yeah. I liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea  but no one felt like shot down  you know  y it didn't matter it saying what you thought  because if it wasn't something that was that relevant  then it didn't matter  'cause it was just another idea in the field. I like that. Um teamwork. Well you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play-Doh model. Um uh I'm still not caught up. But that's nothing to do with the teamwork at all. Um Maybe. No  that was quite fun. Um means  whiteboard  digital pens  etcetera  what does that mean? Any ideas? Had time to kind of Yeah  'cause we could just sort of say  sorry what did you say about that or what do you think about that  rather than having to email it  yeah. But it was nice having it there. Um like the whole picture of the thing. Yeah  I think it's new ideas in general  rather than Mm. Yeah  no. Well they have to come from somewhere  don't they? And as sh as w sorry  you go. Um as was shown by your presentation with all of the other controls  remote controls  no one's thought about it particularly. I mean they're slightly different  so if someone's been shut in the room and said make ours a bit different from everyone else's  'cause it's w something we should think about  but obviously no one's put any great deal of thought into it. Mm. But then when it everything is really smart  and you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table  it doesn't go  I mean if you could have something that's a proper funky thing  a funky item that's individual  individual to you  I mean they could even go into um you go in with an idea and they design it on Photoshop and then they just get it printed on the plastic  you would pray you would pay a lot extra  because it's individually being a plastic was being made for you. But people could have anything that they wanted. Because of the produ Mm. Yes. Yeah. Well  it's innovation for money's sake. The the people have to keep buying. Yeah. And you can't get you've got your handset that works fine  but you can't get the battery anymore for that type of phone  because the phones have moved on  things like that. Yes. It's madness. Um In closing There we go. Um our costs are below budget with recommendations that they the budget be increased  but I think I don't know  d what do you think? Do you think that's takes into account um overheads like us being well paid kind of a thing? And the heating for the building  do you think our budget includes everything  all the costs that are going out? So it looks well it looks like it's gonna be fifty percent profit  you've still got all of the overheads to come out of that. So maybe increasing it  you would also have to increase the price that it's sold at. But I think but you were saying that that's quite Hmm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. It's a shame it won't ever get made. Maybe it will. Maybe someone'll r run down and patent it. Um the project has been evaluated well and truly. Um and we've got the meeting survey and questionnaire. Oh  so we've got about fifty minutes to catch up with everything that I fell behind with  so I'll be delegating in my um role as Project Supervisor  so good luck. I think the celebration is the twenty five pounds. Either that or we'll be dancing on the desks. Oh. Um yeah  just the last  I think. I think I've got minutes for two of the meeting and the last thingy. I just got con Hmm. Thank you. Hmm. Hmm. Yep  me too. Mm-hmm. Yep. Me and William worked on a prototype  and I think William is going to make a p presentation on that. Yeah. I can hold it like Yeah  so It looks crazy. Um not now. Oh. Yeah. Oh  where are the hinges? 'Kay. You able to look? Yep.. The black and white touch screen wherein people can Right. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. Ah oka Infrared could be here also. Yeah  here.. So when it's even if it's open here  the signals would go. Yeah. This one right here.. Which is No. Look up to it. Yay. So this is the one. Sorry. Evaluation.. Mm um I I think this is chip. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Ah  it's perfect. Is it everybody is going to evaluate  or just the Market okay. 'Kay. Yeah  so you can 'Kay. I would say four. Mm-hmm. Almost three. I think yeah. Oh sorry  I I got it wrong. The first one rating  I'm sorry. Can you just make it two? The first. Yeah  I I just it the other way. Uh in Yep  I just got two point f One is a  seven is false  okay. Two. Two. White. With for the plastic? Uh blue. Any Right. Mm-hmm. Yeah  because you'll be having a Because of the rubber case. One. Mm. Four. Voice r recognition. Hmm. You want me to b unplug that? That's all. Yes. Okay. Chip on print. Okay. Yep. Single-curved. Two curves  yeah. Single-cu. Plastic and rubber. Yeah. Plastic one and maybe rubber point five. No I think rubber  since it's being used just as a casing  we can put point five. Yeah  because there are I think it allows the point five  yeah. We can use that. It means we are not using a lot of rubber actually. We're using just a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic. Push-button. One. An One. I think we could change the battery also. Instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery. Uncurved  flat. No  it just surprises one.. I don't think so. Ri I think it's in Euro. And going to a regular bat Yeah. What I feel is  customers never said anything about the battery. It's internal  nobody looks into the battery. But shape and colours  that's something we shouldn't comprimi Where's that special form? Mm mm mm. Mm-hmm. Make it costly. Yeah we are close to the budget. Two five. It's twelve point five maybe  then. I don't know what it said fifty percent of the cost. So half of the price would be I think it is the first one. So we are under the budget. Seems fine. Except voice recognition  everything is Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think we had a nice time. Yeah  I think there was uh very constructive feedback by everybody. It's not like people trying to cut each other. There is more of uh true cohesive teamwork. We came to a very predic creative design  yeah. Yeah  and uh Yeah  I think. And Sarah  you coordinated the work very well. Yeah. I think that was the best part of the 'Kay. Yeah  moving around the room. But I think it's good  like uh we spent times individually. I never thought of a remote control with a flip top. That's mine. Yeah  it's The thing is Yep  sorry  go on Sarah. Surprising to me is like uh people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones  like a real want to see a new launch or something like that. And new f television products coming up  but nobody giving uh much idea to this. Like Sarah was telling  everything's Right. Mm-hmm. Maybe fifty percent more. Yeah. Who knows? Yeah. There's a final questionnaire. Celebration  you didn't talk about that. Yeah. ,The project manager acquainted the team with the tools and equipment around them and then had the team members introduce themselves by name and what role they had in the project. The project manager then introduced the upcoming project along with more tools and equipment to the team members. The team members then participated in an exercise in which they drew their favorite animals. After the drawing exercise  the project manager talked about the project finances and production costs. The team then discussed their experiences with remotes and various features to consider when producing a remote. 
Hello. Yes  I made it. English from now on. Drawing or Yeah. Ooh it works. Spicy. Where are are all the other presentations? The conceptual or Ah. Because I see only my own presentation yeah. This? I'll just put it in there. Or not. Ah  I can't cut and paste it into the other folder but Move to meeting room. Yeah. Yeah me too . Yeah. Yes. Me first again or yeah. Alright. Did you open it already or no. Ah. Ah. Yes. So welcome to the marketing presentation once again. Um this time about trendwatching. Uh well there has been inv investigation again  in the in the remote control market. Uh it shows a number of developments. Uh I will address them uh in a moment. Um fashion watch watchers uh have detected the trends for young public  because that's our public. Um well fruit and vegetables will be will be the most important theme for clothing  uh shoes and furniture. And the feel of the material is expected to be spongey. So um the developments I will address them oh yeah well this is the fruit and vegetables looks of fresh bright colours. So to give you an idea. Um well the developments? Uh development one. Uh well most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel. Instead of the current uh functional look-and-feel. Um well fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and the interface. And the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological uh innovative. Um well it stands for the use of technical features that do not exist in current remote controls. I think we pretty much covered that with our screen and um and speech recognition  so I don't expect that to be a problem. And the third development um is that the remote control should be easy to use. Um Well the first aspect uh was twice as important as the second aspect w which was twice as important as the third aspect. So um that kind of gets you this ratios. So fancy look-and-feel uh is the most important uh point of attention. Uh so the fruits and vegetables in combination with the spongey material. Um well technolog technological innovation  we've covered that pretty much I guess. Um and easy to use  I don't think that will be problem. So my point of attention is especially this part. That this will be a crux. So that was the marketing uh presentation. I had only one document left. So kind of this So a k a small example. Kind of this this look. Uh nothing about the buttons but just sponge kind of thing  and and some fruit and colours I dunno. Just made a quick design. Alright. Yeah. It's okay. F_ five. Yeah. Wi an indoors. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I guess we can only choose one. Yeah. And it's more fun. Yeah  just playing with it and especially when the material's rubber. It can be done  I mean  you can't harm it  so it's a perfect combination I guess. Yeah. So So double curved is like this  this  this  or Mm. Yeah. Also in in height? Yeah okay. Yeah with the programme. And and the and the buttons that you need to control it  I guess. Yeah. Back and okay. No. Rubber material. So that's uh is that is that the advanced chip? Wow. Yeah. Alright. Kinetic. Double curved.. The cost of making it should be twelve and a half? Yeah  so it's cheap. Um well the interface type supplements. If you go to your homepage or something  you should get your own information. I got my fresh and fyoo fruity uh picture uh also uh over there  so No. Too less time. Yeah  also the menu. Yeah that that w Yeah. Yeah I was thinking of that also  with with a with a uh arrow. So that indicates that there's an menu under that menu. So Oh yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Cool. S underwater uh yeah. Yeah. Yeah.. Yeah. Also a kind of rubber uh Yeah. That should be nice. So s Yeah there's only in in this dimension. Like this. So curvy or not. Yeah so we keep it singly c single curved then? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So from top view it looks kinda like this. But from the side you you can have it also in a kind of shape. Maybe because the the screen is on top you can have Maybe you can c have this kind of shape. A little upwards. So that the screen is more towards yourself  so you can easily see your screen. Well well you have it in your hand so it's a kind of an angle from your eyes to the screen. So then you have double double curved in some way. So this this is so the screen is positioned over here. Oh. Something like that. And the buttons are more  well it's very thick now but That's uh that's Yeah? That that you can press it and then it comes up? Or But then the side view can be straight. If you have a pop-up screen. But I dunno if that's too expensive. I mean maybe it's too much Oh the advanced buttons. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So okay b but you have t you need some button to flip this open. Yeah. Yeah and it says menu and it flips open and then you have the buttons to control it  in combination with your True. It uh c it can go open. An adv an adv and it will be covered in some kind of uh thin rubber layer or something like that. Yeah  uh It's very no it's very strong. Yeah. Yeah the lower part doesn't work I guess  so maybe you should try it over there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah but but that's optional for later I guess. I mean  we have to make Yeah we we better so choose one Yeah so okay we should better choose one sh one shape. But that's the kind of the idea  so it lays good in the hand  and then on on the side with with your thumb  you you can you can use  yeah  you can use the button option Spongey. Spongey can be reached by means of Yeah. And and the and the control thngs in the middle? The the the arrows? Yeah and then numbers. Yeah. Alright. Uh pretty nice design. Yeah. Yeah it looks uh pretty fancy.. Uh bananas wierd shape and other fruits also  so it's better to have um some sort of basic print and then a fruit print in some primary uh colours. I don't know what what colours should the basic print be like? Like some soft green or something? Or and then Oh yeah yeah  dark blue and then and then very bright  uh a yellow banana  an orange  uh a green apple  stuff like that  with very uh bright tones I guess. So you have something like Yeah. Mm. That doesn't really work. To draw  I guess. Oh. What's this? Right. Hm. Yeah. Two hours further. thickness. Oh. Oh. Wh why not go for the twenty? Yeah. That's what I call painting. So that's that's a dark blue basic colour I guess. It's pretty nice. And then uh Oh Yeah with some some yellow banana Like. Yeah? How do you mean? Some some Yeah an orange. Well alright well this is more like purple I guess  but it's should be more real dark blue  so the contrast with the with the fruit objects is uh pretty high. So uh yeah. That would be a nice uh nice device I guess. I mean  the the colour of the background of the display? Ah well I don't guess it s has to be a sixty uh sixty six five thousand uh colour  so yeah too expensive. So just just a a blue blue backlight or something like that. Green is too old-fashioned. But blue  blue's okay. J White backlight  and dark. Yeah. Whatever which is visible. I know you sh you should test it under uh under a light conditions. I mean it's hard to tell uh I dunno. Yeah. True. Which which uh colour should the buttons be? Why adjustable? No uh But maybe I mean they have to they have to have some colour right? And if the background is very dark blue Yeah? So more like Doesn't work very well. Uh. More like this colour. And then then yellow and orange and red objects on it or something. But then then again  which colour should the buttons be? The the press buttons. Should they be white or black or Uh Yeah but it's pretty fresh  on the other side. Yeah. My couch is in that colour. Yeah. Well it works pretty well. And then time was up. Uh. That you have five minutes left or So something like this. That should be pretty nice colour. But maybe the buttons  all buttons in red is maybe a bad contrast for colourblind people. Because the of the green. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. Okay. So red buttons are okay? How do you mean? Yeah. No that's that's too busy I guess. You better bet better better keep the LED and the button itself in the same colour I guess. So just an extra bit of light and attention. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Of the product? Which we don't have yet. So wh how should I do that? Oh okay. Or you you or you send it to me. Or just because you are going to design it on this board right? Yeah. I I probably get instruction on that  how to do that  so I make another presentation I guess. I kn I know what's gonna happen in in yeah so I've a basic idea. Yeah. Yeah. Alright so that's uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.. Yeah. On the left. S so  yeah. Yeah. This? Uh pretty accurate. Oh we skip this I guess. Sound button press. Light only button user ca user interaction. Yeah. Yeah. So the pl the plastic plastic buttons also help uh because of um they are only lit during interaction. So Well it's a good thing that the buttons aren't um  well that they are plastic  because then you can light up the light on when when they are usable. Maybe you should draw it very large like this. Oh right. Erase? Yeah. Much easier  yeah. I don't see a sign that the meeting is over yet but Yeah. Oh. Wrong one. Alright. But we we I is it if if this is from the side woah. Steady. Because there the screen goes up like that right? So then it's like this  or that's not convenient because then you have the screen like this and look like the it's better to have it somewhat like this. Or does it flip all the way? It's better to to have this like this I guess  and then flip it like this. Yeah. So w yeah. But we still keep the flipping mechanism. Yeah. Yeah but maybe Yeah but maybe we we should then Yeah there the middle Sh sh shouldn't we integrate it? And then like i oh th doh. Come on. So this is the shape. Oh. It hasn't Okay but the screen is a bit lower because if it falls on the other side  it doesn't fall on the screen. So there's a layer of rubber on the side. So no flipping but just no. Throwing and the kinetics. Oh. We better make we better make it like this. Eventually. Yeah. Uh they are responsible enough to have a mobile phone  so also to to deal with their uh remote uh control. Yes. Yeah? Ooh. Yeah. Alright. Good. Yeah. We should work in our own room right? Or not? Yeah. Yes. See you two in half an hour uh . Just kidding. So annoying. I just put it in the in the shared folder so it should be yeah I think so. Yeah  conceptual design. What or whatever does it No no no  can you go back one? Uh 'cause it has to be PowerPoint pre yeah components design  that's it.. I did get a bit more done than the last time  'cause I knew that I didn't have time so I just copy and paste everything into the Sometimes I have these pop-ups or these sounds and there's nothing there  and also with I don't know how to use PowerPoint  so it takes me forever to get something done with it. Yeah. Thi Mm-hmm. Who wants to start? Sound. Yeah yeah uh uh. Yeah. And shall I go first? So I Yeah? Alright. Uh components. Oh no. Yeah true. Um Alright. So I'm dealing with the components design. Um let's see. I uh used some design examples we had uh from similar products. And I used uh possibilities from our manufacturing department about current components which will have to be implemented in the design. That's why I had to  wanted to go first. Well they gave me um an idea about what people want. We're f mainly focusing on this group  but I want to make the distinction clear. Uh I could not drag the pictures into the the slides so s so I don't have examples of how it looks like. But it comes down to what you uh what you think we should do with the spongey and the fruity looking uh type. If you  the young dynamic people want soft primary colours uh  which looks like fruits you know  you can and shapes that are curved and not uh solid straight lines anymore. So this basically um yeah goes on to what you were mentioning earlier. There is a lot of um factors involved in choosing the components. There's a lot of options that we have to discuss. Uh for example the energy source. we have four types. The basic battery. Uh we have a hand dynamo  which we yeah we Dutch refer to it as the kneipgatt. Uh the kinetic provision of energy which means if you move the thing  if you shake it. Which will be fun for toddlers right  if they wanna use the And uh of course solar cells. But I dunno how we would use that into the design of the actual product. So uh my yeah also also in you know countries where there's n isn't much light like in Scandinavia  they wouldn't be y able to use it half of the year you know. So that's not cool either. So um for the uh a case  there's uh the traditional uncurved flat hard case. Single curved  which means that it has uh curves in one dimension. Or the double curved. Um I wasn't able to finish my uh personal preferences sheet  but well you know that we will have to go for the double curved 'cause it's daring and different from what we have now. Uh the case materials. Well we have all kinds of hard uh materials like the the hard plastic  the wood and the titanium. I would definitely go for rubber 'cause it fits most in what people wanna see nowadays. Um poo  this is a lot of text. I wasn't able to organise this yet. We have yeah several uh interface designs. Uh we can use a scroll buttons for the menus  but we already kind of decided to go for the f for the pushbuttons  for the the arrow buttons. So that's not really interesting. Electronics? Yeah  maybe we wanna decide on what electronics to use the advanced chip I think is easiest to implement uh for the production  'cause they they can print it better. Um Yeah. I think this is about it. Yeah I was working on some per personal preferences. I first uh chose for the battery  'cause yeah I'm traditional and that's the most obvious  easiest choice to go to. But I really think that we should maybe uh think about the kinetic energy  where you have to move the thing to be able to use it. Yeah maybe we I can imagine that the kinetic uh type energy source would be more expensive to make. But it is more longlasting  that the people don't have to ever buy batteries again. And it's also more fun yeah. I always chuck my uh remote control around  so Yeah y exactly. You don't have to be scared about bouncing it off the g floor and breaking it or whatever. So that's the end of it. Uh go ahead. No it means curved in two dimensions. So uh w single curved? Uh let's say would be a b square box  but then with curves on one dimension. And double curved would means that it would have curves curves in every direction. Like three D_. Yeah. Design? I And rubber. Rubber material. Yeah we need the the chip on print to be able to support the the screen and uh and f audio function. Yeah. Yeah. Otherwise you would have a simple chip  just for pressing buttons. But we need more. I'm just thinking  this is not my department  but I I'm not sure what this is gonna cost  to be able to m So 'cause we need to sell it for twenty five Euro a piece. That's gonna be difficult huh? Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah. Child labour man  we love it. Um let me see. Wait a sec. Yeah I'm going there now. Inspiration. Well Um yeah maybe it's Maybe it's easier Yeah. Yeah perfect. Maybe it's easier if you guys come over here. S see this is the the the standard traditional type  where the form uh yeah serves the function  you know. It's like really basic. But this m is more appealing to old people and we don't want that. This is what we're looking for. And th that means curved in both dire dire uh dimensions. Not only like this but it has to be exactly. It has to be kind of instead of the PlayStation  the module. It has to be like the the Game Cube  you know  where your thumbs would be laying in the instrument and it has to be nice to hold. And It ha Yeah but that's that's the the problem uh yeah the dilemma actually  'cause we wanna appeal to the to the young public with fancy with flashy colours  and with a lot of shape. And Yeah  and the and the rubber  it it will look cheap always  you know  with the There is mobile phones  in which you can change the colour also of the lights. Maybe we should consider this function. To customise it and so I mean kids can make it look more flashy with different kinds of colours and people who want something  you know  different  or more uh design  they can go for one colour like uh for example this uh photo th camera. Personally I think it's really ugly. Just give me the thing that it's inside there maybe I'm too old for this stuff. Yeah. So those I think are all my oh. And this is  this is with the curved that I mean. Yeah. Yeah? A compromise between what? This  this would be uh single curved uh? Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. I think the I mean our aim is to make something different right? To make something new. I would go for the double curved. And I I'm I'm thinking uh you know uh a drawing palette  where you have the shape for your thumb. So it kind of holds nicely  something like that. Well this is really your decision but Yeah. As well. You can make a trigger button or something like that. Yeah or that that is the confirmation button or something  that you scroll with your thumb  with the arrows  and then confirm. That would be a nice way to use it but I mean  yeah  I'm thinking big already  and we need something that well that that you can able to use in one hand I think. Yeah.. How about Mm-hmm. Yeah I understand what you mean. How about we do a uh a pop-up screen  like the laptop. So that the only the simple functions will be visible at first. And then if you want Yeah. Something like that. Yeah. No uh like I would draw it like this. Let's say this is the side view. That you have a a screen that will come up here  and can go down that way. If you know what I mean. So that it would come up like that. Yeah or preferably even keep the simple buttons here  and then under the screen even you could put more more advanced buttons. F for the L_C_D_ menu right? So w w Oh Activate and th the yeah. True. True. But you can make a  yeah  you can make a trigger here. You know a simple uh with a Yeah. Exactly. Well yeah the the idea of it was  is that because you close it  you cover the L_C_D_ screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever. And Exactly. Exactly. We just have to make sure that the closing mechanism won't break. Th it's very solid yeah. That actually will offer some extra protection for the Yeah. Yeah I was thinking  if if you have your hand  it this is your th Okay. If this is your thumb  and this is your hand like that. With your uh wrist. That you  that it would be kind of shape like this  you know. So it's easier to hold in your hand  to y f Uh yeah. Yeah of course. Yeah then w then you would have to to make it like this. Like like you drew here. And maybe th then make this thicker also than the centre. Give it I would give it a female shape but uh yeah. Anyway. Obviously. Make it more appealing to guys. I mean Yeah but we have hardware inside  which is so it has to have some sort of basic shape. And also the screen  you cannot mould it. You know kind of thing. Yeah. And then you can You can place the screen here  which can come. And but then I w I would I would do the arrows here  kind of thing. Those buttons? And the simple buttons here  so that I Uh y eah that's what I mean. The arrows over here  and here the s simple uh or do we wanna make its shape look like a banana or something? I dunno. Yeah. Yeah we could make We should use Yeah w we need very primary colours  like bright red  bright yellow. Yeah. Yeah okay yeah. And how about some uh some flashing standby lights? Like you have on the Samsung  well I don't like to call brands phones  the you know that 'cause I remember from one of our first meetings that uh people lose their uh remote controls often. So it not not only in in the colours of the LEDs  that we want something to keep it visible at all times  or Um Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. As long as you loo use uh high contrast between the the background and the foreground colour. So that people with uh with And also for people who are a bit colourblind. But don't we wanna make the background the the bright colo colours? So th the total of the thing is very bright? Like the pictures I showed you guys. Those things were all like like bright red  bright red  flashy. Yeah something like that  something that stands out more. Yeah. The green? It's actually a pretty trendy colour at the moment. Do you get a pop-up if we Alright. No that's actu Red and green are actually the b the easiest to discriminate. Even for colourblind. They will see one of each as grey. But if you use uh green on blue  those kind of colours will look the same. I think. I think so. You can what we should do I think is is make kind of a see-through plastic button  with uh one coloured LED behind it. So that the whole button will shine as the colour the And if you think about easy to use buttons  we have to  well we have to make it the shape so that it's easy to hold f for both hands  but also that you can reach the buttons with your thumb  if you hold the machine. Ah  right. So we're gonna work here? On this sketchboard? Alright. Thanks. Alright. Thirty minutes. Alright. Yeah. Shall we uh make a new uh Yeah  I just make a new one. Alright. Huh? Yeah I'll just I'll just keep it there. Yeah. Uh sorry. Okay. Current colour? So um Shall we make some outline sketches of the basic shape first? Because I I Yeah 'cause I have to uh focus on the on the basic look-and-feel design. So how it's gonna look. And you have to think uh how we're gonna put the screen in it and those kind of things. So if I'm drawing and you think okay I'm not gonna be able to put a screen in there  you have to correct. Uh do you mind if I draw in black then? For normal sketches. so we kind of want the girlish figure. I'm not so good at drawing. Excuse me? No uh uh. How do we uh uh or insert text? Oh that's a bit big. Yeah. Yeah. Ex exactly. Uh Uh I thought for the side view  that the w the basic section would be rather uh a bit thicker than the middle  where you're holding it with your 'cause your fingers have to fit underneath and Exactly but the uh but the upper side has to be a bit more like that I think. Uh don't you think? So the display we will put in here  the basic uh functions in here  where it's most reachable. The The th Exactly. Oh. This is hard. What do don't have to draw it exactly do we? Wait. Let me try it one more time. Maybe I've uh it's easier if I draw it in once. Okay  of course it will become way more ugly. Yeah. This'll take forever. It's fun to work with this pen. Um so  larger. And yeah. So side. 'Kay. Um other views? Uh Yeah. Let's fill i fill in the buttons later. So this is gonna be from the uh from yeah yeah. Sorry. Yeah. Yeah? The the idea is that it has to flip up to here. Okay. Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah. True. you can adjust the angle to which it flips. So it can also from this angle  it can flip all the way up to there. You can flip it up to there if you want. Think so. Yeah because I think it will feel weird if you would make this smaller and this bigger or something that I dunno. I thought it would be cool.. It doesn't aim so well. Yeah yeah yeah. Definitely. Yeah I guess but uh I mean most votes count right? Yeah. Yeah true true. Yeah. Yeah if you if you're going for the kinetics Yeah. I'm just thinking totally different designs also. Remember that the weird pocketphone thingy which looked like kind of a Gameboy. Maybe we should try something like that. But yeah. Oh right. Alright. Yeah. I like it. Okay. This can go. Oh yeah we have to f uh include that in our design as well. Let's see. What the hell's that? Uh Yeah. I think we do. Yeah or j or also scrolling for the m yeah. Yeah? I dunno. We w kind of wanted to stick with the Yeah I'm just thinking  if we i we wanna make something different right? So the with the scroll is is more futuristic than the standard arrow buttons. I think. Okay. I I've got the same problem as well. Oh. No. Yeah. No problem Yeah. No. I I don't mi I don't mind. That's Do you want to go first? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. It's better than than my uh drawing. Yeah okay but I have to design the Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Pushbuttons. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. As an optional uh feature. Or combine uh both with a with one uh Okay. And throw it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. One one uh very important thing I was uh yeah thinking about is the speech uh option. We were going to use that. Yeah. So um Yeah um yeah that's one thing uh which I'm not sure uh of how to implement it uh into the remote control. No okay but it has to be combined with with the menu uh for functions and So okay. Yeah. Okay. But do uh j do we uh do the speech just for the basic options  for the simple buttons? For for everything  also for the advanced options? Okay. Uh we have this very uh basic uh trendy design. Everybody says it so that's what's uh yeah um Yeah in the in the last uh meeting we uh we were yeah putting the the simple and the advanced options separated. That's yeah obvious. Um yeah. Pressing the the menu option uh will disable uh all other options on your uh remote control. And only the the L_C_D_ panel will uh light up and then you can only uh change the yeah the options. Yeah. Um yeah design has to be very attractive but that's your your op your yeah. you have to uh delete this but this is the the the simple uh layout. Uh display on the upper side with the the menu button and maybe a some sort of cancel button or save button. I'm The back. Back and okay yeah. Uh What? A little bit I think but not not everything w Okay. Oh I uh didn't read that. But But this is the the basic uh design uh for the for the m yeah for the buttons. Um I wanted to to categorise everything. Uh with a speech display uh yeah  sound  everything you you noted in your uh minutes. Um every pushbutton has uh has its own uh LED light. So you can uh yeah change uh m make it more trendy for for younger people. And uh if there are older people they wanted more uh yeah more uh luxurous so that's an a also an option. Um that was it. Yeah. Yeah.. We're going to produce it in uh China so it's no problem. Uh it's it's quite difficult because we we haven't got all the options uh yeah. Yeah. This is the the menu I was uh looking uh at. Yeah. Arrow yeah. Yeah. S yeah. Yeah. But it has also to it it has also to be uh luxurous uh for for yeah rich people. Th this looks a little bit like like for only for children. So Yeah. The colour Yeah. Okay but the the colours  you you can make it uh make the colours with LEDs uh beneath the the buttons. If you press a button and you can disable the the colour LEDs for for people that don't like it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Very cheap uh cheap look. Yeah but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons. If you have uh it have it in your hand  you you you are not only um yeah you don't need one dimension but you can use other dimensions for pressing the the buttons. Yeah. Something to shoot at your television Yeah. That's yeah. Okay. Yeah. That's the the more advanced options were uh for the for the menu. But you you want okay. You just want to hide them all? The oh. Yeah yeah yeah. That's but it's it's not it's not very uh very strong uh yeah if you drop it one time. Okay. But when you are left-handed  that's that's a problem. But that's that's very expensive uh Yeah. We we could make some some rubber uh some rubber uh yeah mouse  with which you can change uh and so if you Yeah. Okay. Some yeah. No no no no. Okay.. Yeah. No the arrow's over here. Yeah. Or blue? Dark blue or Yeah. Yeah but the primary colours w we can uh create with the with the LEDs on the on the remote control. If you we uh yeah. If you make it uh just a yeah bl give it a blue colour  then it's just a neutral colour  also for the for the more uh yeah for the people. So that's So that's blue. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe a Yeah. And which which colour should uh should I give the the display? Uh Or Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah maybe a maybe a white a white backlight? Dark uh letters  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's adjustable. Yeah? Or not. That's how we are going to make it uh more trendy. Or is it uh too expensive? Mm. And it it looks quite cheap  that colour I think. It's it's not Yeah. I dunno. It's it's trendy okay. But Mm. Yeah. Yeah. But the but the buttons have their own LEDs or not? Okay. Okay. That that's a default uh setting. The the red buttons. Okay. Yeah I I was think about a red uh red LEDs and blue LEDs and Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. But we have to do it at this moment  after th this meeting? Okay. Yeah. Ah so this is basically the what what we are thinking about? Yeah l let's just uh delete all these uh or Oh  next. Okay. Uh Yeah. And then after that we can make the user uh inter interface. Yeah. Yep. Oh no it's it's okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah but this part isn't uh functioning properly. It's a bit uh large.. L let's make first the the the all the views. The the front view  side view and the back view. Yeah. The middle has to be very small so you can have it in your hand. Yeah the display  we yeah we can put a display. Yeah. The the arrow functions. Yeah. Yeah. No it's it's uh it's okay. You can make it m larger. Maybe it's easier to to draw uh Yeah that's that's the basic idea. Yeah. Yeah only if you are going to put buttons on the side of the unit. That's the question. Yeah. From the Yeah I'm I'm May maybe it's it's easier to to integrate the the the L_C_D_ screen just into this this bubble. Because it do doesn't have to flip then. Because we have en enough space for for making a an L_C_D. Because here But why why do we need uh the flipping uh Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh the the shape is okay but yeah? I don't see the the yeah why why we should use the the flipping uh mechanism. Because we Okay yeah. It's it's for for for more trendy uh Because we have enough space. H here we got uh the basic functions  the the arrow uh yeah button. Yeah and then h we sh mm. Yeah  then it's No flipping or you wanted the flipping so But if you if you If you drop it it it just breaks. And it has to be very strong because of the. Yeah kind of And it's also for the for the children  it's yeah for people not sixteen years. But there are more Yeah okay. That's true. Okay. Yeah? Okay wi Yeah. The Real Remote. I think uh it's the sensors. Okay. Yep. Okay that's the side. Ah it's it's okay. But do we want uh options on the on the side with the with the buttons? Or just leave it? Uh could make an uh a volume button uh scroll  volume button. For menu. Or Yeah. No  yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah you are going to design it so .. Yeah just testing. Mm? English.. Break is over. Whoo. Spicy. So  he's coming. Oh okay. Ah. She. You can look at the final report  'cause I have to record everything we are deciding and such  so I'm trying to write it down between everything else. Oh. Yeah. Here we go again. Welcome. Uh we have again three presentations and then we have to decide on what concepts the mobile phone has to uh f the remote control has to support. So who wants go. Yes? Yeah sure. Doesn't matter. No. Mm-hmm.. Yeah yeah sure. No. Cool. Yeah you're just the user interface hmm? Yeah layout. Yeah okay. You probably opened it. F_ five. Yeah. Yeah okay. Calculator's can do it. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Uh I think you can only fit one uh source of energy on the Yeah I didn't receive any info uh. Yeah. S yeah it's safe. 'Kay next. Uh Okay. Can we uh Yeah. Well the visual representation is not there with speech but you can Yeah. Just yeah. I think you can just uh match the speech commands with the functions that are already present. So I don't think you have to design anything else for that. Both. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That would be the back. Back and okay. You did read the minutes I wrote? You did read the minutes I wrote? Oh okay 'cause I pretty much summed up all the buttons there were. So I hate doing work for nothing. Mm-hmm. That was it? Okay. Uh again. Ugh. Okay so what we have to decide is what kind of components do we use? Uh energy source  chip type  case type. And user interface. But I didn't see a clear distinction between these so I think what we have is okay. So we only  we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy. Uh the case would be doubly curved. So Rubber material. And that's the only thing we have left. Oh okay. No it's easy. Advanced chip. Okay. Too. Uh I didn't get any info on this. So Yeah. I have total here. Yeah I don't know. I didn't get any information about that so Yeah. Who doesn't. Uh let's see. Is there a new thing? Yeah the interface  maybe can Ooh. No. Uh do you have a picture of doubly curved case? And could you put that in the group folder? Of the project folder. Ah you didn't draw it yourself. Ah. Arrow. Yeah.. 'S the target group. Yeah sure. Yeah. Oh okay. I see. Yeah also like this. So you can hold it.. The children's story. Yeah I've got it. Distinction. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Different. Mm-hmm. Camera. Yeah submarine. Well Yeah but this this the is for the. Okay. Uh Ah yeah bright colours. That's singly curved. Okay. Well we could make a compromise between that. But I don't know if it's worth the effort. Uh instead of doubly curved we take a single curved. So to appeal a little more to the all the public. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Also. Yeah that would be an option. I don't know what you think. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah I'd agree. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Different. Stands out. Or Oh yeah a one hand uh solution. can turn it maybe. To switch from buttons to interface hmm. If you turn it a little.. Oh yeah. Least you can easily see it. If you can uh flip. Uh so you have a the the side view. So and you want to be able to make this. Okay so the buttons are on top here  and you flip it over that way. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Right. Yeah that's good idea. Yeah. No not all because you need most of them  the arrow buttons. But you can hide the okay and the back uh button. And the menu button also because when you flip it open and you can maybe even drop the menu button because maybe if you flip it open it will auto activate amauto uh uh automatically. Why? You could just make it mechanical. If you cover it with rubber. Mm. Yeah. So it can bounce. Yeah okay so that that may work. Okay but then we still have the the the thing of the the the shape. Yeah. What kind of Harder.. Maybe can design two versions. Mm-hmm. And ergonomical shape. Yeah. The female shape yeah. With two uh Oh yeah. Some uh k esk uh yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah. Yeah. So the keywords are primary co colours  spongey? Yeah. Yeah. Buttons. Okay. I think that uh it's a nice design. It's cool. Yeah. Yeah that's Orange or something. Mm. Yeah. Huh cool. No it's. Yeah it's text. N no you have to exit. You could also make line with uh Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Y Yeah and then on top of that. Some yellow. Banana colour. Yeah if you if flashing colour so you can't lose it  basically. Well I think it's a bit too much but Yeah. Yeah. Who? And then you can use yellow or semething. Why not? Aye. Like this. Colourblind yeah. No so that's mostly red and green I believe. Woah. All all buttons? Okay. It's difficult. Blue. Maybe green. Yeah you can Mm-hmm flashy. Mm bzz. Red maybe. Black. Why? Yeah. So Ooh.. Uh not yet. Yeah within five minutes yeah. Y left yeah left and then uh I have to kick you out. Yeah yeah. They have LEDs but they have a colour. You can make them red. Yeah. But I think you need to keep in mind that the LEDs are just extra light. Uh they they don't determine the colour that much  I think. 'Cause you have to print on them you have a background. Each number is transparent. Uh partly but you have to print on the number. Or the the sign. So you can't change the colour so Yeah. Bit of light. Bit of feedback. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay with Uh Don't mean to discourage you but uh basically you two are going to work on the smartboard. Next thirty minutes to design something so And the You will do the evaluation. Yeah. Yeah uh about Yeah I don't know. You probably get a mail. Yeah. Once they are finished. Yeah. Yeah but maybe you can do the evaluation you don't have to evaluate yet but you can make a procedure which to follow. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. About. Yeah. You have the basic idea. And you two uh are going to do this. Look-and-feel and Yeah. Good luck. So I uh make new page and uh be creative. Yeah you have uh thirty minutes. Then we have to uh see something which we can uh show to the management. I would yeah. Yeah. Next. Oh and save this uh board. Just save it. Yeah okay but just press save and uh It'll be fine. You can also include clip-art. So if you'll rather draw in paint or something then look. Yeah. Yeah. You can also include it. It's not much work. That's included. Yeah okay. Yeah. Sensitive. I dunno. Maybe just start typing. You also do the other sides. Not only on the front si uh the top side but also the the side view. Uh. Jesus. What do I write down? Why can't I work here? This is much easier. Yeah. Mm. No so I just work here a few minutes. Five minutes left before the meeting ends. Yeah we keep the flip? Keep the flip live. No flipping? It's shaking. Yeah just light on top. Safer. Mm. Yeah okay that the target group. Well. I just uh ended the meeting. You two go design. Oh. By the way. Um I uh thought up a name for our product. Yeah. It's called uh the Real Remote. With a copyright sign after Real. So maybe you can include that somewhere. Yeah. I don't see any power cables here so 'Kay. Good luck. ,The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting and two team members presented three prototypes which differed primarily in shape. The team felt it was not necessary to include a feature to prevent the remote from getting lost as the prototype designs were quite bright. The team conducted a product evaluation of the prototype the team liked the most. They rated the prototype on the basis of its appearance  functionality  technological innovativeness  sponginess  usability  learn-ability  its ability to be found when misplaced  simplicity  and its ability to meet the appropriate demographic. The team then discussed the production costs of the remote and what features they should retain or lose in order to maintain their target cost. The project manager then led the team in a project evaluation in which the team evaluated how they created the project  the information they found and used  their creativity  their teamwork  and the materials they had at their disposal. The team was generally quite satisfied. After the project manager's closing  the team discussed their personal preferences in terms of the prototypes. They also further evaluated the project process and discussed what they had learned. 
What this button for? Okay. But if you want to go to page seven hundred? How man I don't understand it. Can you repeat it? Yeah. Ah okay okay. Okay. Okay okay. Okay. I see. I see. Okay. Okay. Is it really weight? Is it light or Okay. Okay. Ok Okay. Yeah yeah yeah  I see. I under I understand. How long the how long the bit the batteries long. I l yeah. I like I like it. Maybe the the thing that convince me the less is the the multifunctional buttons. Looks a bit Looks a bit puzzled uh I dunno how to say that. You the the b the buttons change h h their function depending if y it's teletext or not And the volume button will will become And what about people who want to use digits? Butto real buttons? Okay. Because have you thought about configuration and all this kind of uh stuff? It's all automatic. Okay. Okay yeah it's fine. W we are living in a wonderful world. Automatically configure. Yeah. S Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I I const I constructed a a list of criteria based on the on the general user requirements. And each criteria is will be evaluated it's uh logical criteria so we must users must say i if it's true or is or if it's false in a in a scale ranging from zero to seven. Because i I'm sorry. Sorry. Ah yeah. It's from sorry  it's from one to seven. It's from from one to seven sorry. Because it should be an even it should be an even uh scale  and five is too short and nine is too long. I'm a I I'm Sorry? Yeah yeah. The variance is mi it's is minimal. I'm um answering your question. Okay. And that's the criteria I I found more useful. I think I sh I I could write the criteria in the on the whiteboard? And we all four could range could evaluate the Okay let's let's evaluate if it's fancy or Seven but I would say seven. It's quite fancy. Six. Six. I would say Everything ar Mm everything It's compared to the all remote controls. Actually I don't know what are the r the real specification of a of a universal remote contro Ah it's not an univer but it's for all kind of T_V_s? Yeah. Four. Four. So four? It means cool features  like new features actually. I would say five. You said seven? Five. Sorry  I have them Of cour Of course the most difficult question for the end. I find it quite cheap actually. I dunno. If i i it depends  if you live in in Switzerland or you live in I don't know. Wha the initial specifications were for the whole all Europe or Yeah this is the the initial specifications. I would say six. It's quite cheap actually. Actually maybe Yeah I change the question. So yeah upload the Yeah it's two different situations. If you really need an universal remote control or if you would change your remote control for a n for a new one. So? What now? What range? Six. Six? Six? Six  so it's uh five point five  or less. Actually yeah  I we Five? You are romantic  really. I would say two. Who is the outlier? Wh wh you said five? I don't know if it's a No because there are more yeah  we shouldn't sum like that. Because the the last two questions is much more important than the rest actually. Otherwise we wouldn't we will not sell. Uh no I didn't anything. Yeah  the uh Yeah. Do you want me to sum o I think it's not S Actually what's the differen Too expensive. Actually whe whe when you wrote regular chip you should put two  because there is another chip here. Yeah but you need Fo i it does nothing actually? Okay so now we have a product which nobody would would buy. Would yeah  would buy. Yeah because th th the evaluation project Ah would buy  yeah. Massively  yeah. Yeah. Okay. Uh you have been in Milan a couple of times  so. And you said the lowest. Yeah  for the batteries Mm-hmm. So more general remote control instead of just focusing on uh on T_V_. The complexity shouldn't be much higher. For you said if it good for D_V_D_ then I would Bye. Okay so we can go to the slides. Yeah. Number three. Oh number two sorry. So final design. Final design. Okay so Michael you can go ahead. You can pull it out first  maybe. Uh And we we do have one more functionality. If you take the banana as such and uh you press the turbo button  so it switch ons the switch ons the T_V_. The turbo button. Additional button. That's right  that's right. So then then both the scroll buttons they are for teletext browsing. And you can tele yeah  once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext  they are no more for channel or vol volume. Yeah. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it always means  whatever the rays goes by they they get reflected and then you are having a better coverage. It's like antennas. And for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries and this and uh the basis station is going to have the input from the mm power line for for charging the batteries. It is very light. Yeah. And we have put these different colours so that people don't mistake them mistake it as a banana. Otherwise it's you know a child comes and so Yeah. Mm-hmm. Oh we didn't think of that yet. Yeah. Oh yeah that's right. Mm-hmm mm-hmm. It'll It'll be always at top somewhere at there. Yeah because now we are having rechargeable batteries so that that is. Eight to ten eight to ten hours. N most no most of the time it's not being used. So when when you are making it on Mm. Mm-hmm. No eight or eight or ten hours of working. If you are just leaving like that it'll be much longer. Yeah. That's right. Yeah. And we are having the speakers regular chip for control. Pricing is was a factor so that's why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip. And uh that's it. That's right. You want to have more functional buttons? You are not convinced. Not not many  we we want to keep it simple. So that this button fo is for teletext which is usually also the case  that usually there is a teletext button and once you press that  the channel buttons  they baco become the scrolling buttons. It's up to you  means. Now that Means let's say this this can move the the larger digits and this can move the smaller digits. That's right. Yeah. So there was there was a constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape. So we are targeting a segment which is which is just very trendy kind of thing  they they don't care about the buttons any more. And anyway Evalua yeah. Why this strange factor of seven? Usually I have seen that scales are from one to ten. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay fine  got the idea. Okay. Okay  okay  great. Okay. Yeah yeah. Go ahead. Mm-hmm. Sure. Okay. Yeah yeah. Yeah. So you can say fancy  handy. Handy. Yeah  it's fancy  according to me. Seven. Seven by me. Okay. So you can add seven plus six plus seven plus Five. Again I'll give seven. Yep. Seven for me. I'll give five. That's right. That's right. The standards. What is available in the market off the shelf. We Five. So four point two? four. There I'll give it seven. That's right. For a T_V_ the most important feature which I felt was the locator which is a cool feature. And then the scroll buttons are again cool features. We don't have L_C_D_ for it but that we decided we don't want to have. Mm-hmm. Seven. Okay. Definitely seven. Okay. I'll say five. I'll say five. Why? No but it's really handy actually if you see. It's it's so handy. And then Anyb anybody who comes here anybody who comes to your home he'll at least ask once what is this. It's a very positive thing if you see like that. Youngsters. You want to flaunt. You with your girlfriend or something. Or might be it does some other kind of thing but Uh yeah  crazy. I say five. And you have saved it? You'll have to reload. They're not going to be as And they they might not be a as easy as this yeah. Yeah. S I go slightly up. Six. Six  five  four. Okay. I'll still give it five. Yeah. So it's somewhere three point five I think. No I said five. Mm-hmm. Oops. Yeah it's it's funny. Yeah  sure. Mm-hmm. Solar cells  yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  we said no to that. I think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing. Yeah. To bring the cost Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So we have the regular chip on the print  which is one. And that's it. And we have sample speaker. Yeah. Yeah. the cost of that is very high. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And we have sev Yeah. So we we'll put some extras  if there is something. Okay. To reduce the cost  it's okay. Oh it's got all the directions so don't worry. It's got a direction. Okay. Okay. Yeah. That's right. We don't have any push buttons. No that is a scroll wheel itself  it'll be put in that. Ah okay  okay. Okay  okay. Yeah. No. There's no chip there. It just emits the signal. And the receiver accepts it and that's it. Just se sends the signal  that's it. Yep. No. Yeah. So first thing which we should take care of is  instead of rubber  let it be plastic. And uh that much money will be required for the base station  which is not there. Yeah. That's right. So might be ninety centimes for the the remaining things which the cord and everything which'll go That's right. Yeah. S Detachable battery. They like that. Mm-hmm. Biased. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. The cost of the thing can be made more than might be. Because I think it's just the optimal  what we have done for the cost which we are looking forward to. Interface. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That's right. Yeah. Integrate. Mm-hmm. So What else? Okay. Home? Happily satisfied. Mm-hmm. Thank you. Yeah so uh following our decision to uh make a yellow well to make a banana remote okay so we actually have a We've well first first of all we made a an attractive base station uh with a banana leaf uh look and feel um and uh bana sit the banana sits in there k you know nicely weighted so that it's not gonna tip over and um this is the remote itself  it's kind of it's it's ergonomic  it fits in the hand uh rather well. We've got the two uh uh scroll wheels here which you know one on the the left for the uh volume and the one on the right for for the channel and uh underneath we have the uh the turbo button which is in like a nice uh trigger position for you know for pressing quite naturally. This is when you when you uh are scrolling the uh through the channels you can tell it to to skip th past channels that you quickly rather th Yeah. Well when you stop scrolling the wheel it stops. But normally with uh it will just uh s stay on each station briefly so you can see the the picture. The T_V_ yeah. The s the turbo button. So rather than having uh an extra button for um for the on off switch you just use the turbo button. This is a teletext button. So once you press that then you get teletext and you can use the the channel selector scroll wheel as uh To navigate yeah. Yeah. Well then you can you you have like a little uh number selection thing  you press the the the teletext button uh to move between uh the fields and then you can just scroll the number back and forth so you have s you go you scroll to seven and then zero zero and then you can uh Well you can you can press press the teletext button and then you then you can you can f Mm uh And this is the uh the infrared uh port. Also the top of the banana. So. And then we have in the uh in the base station we have the the button at the front for uh for calling the uh the banana. Actually they do. That's that's yeah that's uh that's form and function in the one in the one uh object. Yeah. So. But yeah that's um that's just like that's an attractive um base station. So. Okay. It's it's uh it's about the weight of a banana. You know  to give you the correct look and feel. I think a child would try to eat it anyway  so maybe we should consider that. maybe health and safety aspects. Yeah. I don't really know if the solar cells are actually necessary any more if you have a recharging base station. If I was gonna place them I'd put them on the on the top here since that's like uh the black bit but yeah I don't I really don't think it's necessary to have the solar cells anymore. Mm. The what sorry? What do you mean? Ah. Ah. A long time. No no no  it can it should be weeks. Yeah but y people don't like to put it back in the base station all the time people leave wanna leave it on the couch so Ah  okay. Okay. Yeah. It seems to be falling over. Or can move between positions in the in the number. It's all automatic. Yep. Uh. Yeah uh five. Five  maybe maybe maybe six it's it's I guess it's yeah. I'd give it a six like I'd I think it's probably more handy than my current remote  'cause of the scroll wheels but maybe loses the point for not having you know the extra buttons when you reall if you do need them for some reason but you know you can always use your other remote. Yeah. Well it depends when you say functional  do you mean it does what we want it to do  or d does what it does  you know  can it make you coffee? You know. Yeah. Yeah. That's before Yeah. I have to say four. Well it's not a universal remote. Remember we're focus we're supposed to focus just on T_V_s. Well all T_V_s but only T_ only T_V_s I guess. Four. Just four. Obviously there are some outliers so Which I'll say five. Yeah. S yeah. 'Cause it's five five seven seven so Uh  okay  definitely easy to use. Seven. Alright  now here's the sixty million Dollar question  well  twenty five twenty five Euro question. What do you what do you guys reckon? Hmm. Uh Yeah. Yeah. I'd say two. I don't want a banana on my living room table  a banana remote. It is handy  it's handy  but it it's terrible. Yeah. Yeah  but it's not a positive thing. Well  you know  it's it's handy  it's ergonomic  but it's a banana. Yeah but it says I  I would buy this  so. No  it's I. I would buy S s Still I I'd say two. I don't think I at any stage in my life I would want a banana remote control  really. I can say  maybe there is a market for it  I dunno. Yeah. Okay  so  it depends if uh If I had t if I had to spend twenty five Euro  if that was like my limit  maybe I would buy it. Because the other twenty five Euro remote controls are probably gonna look worse than a banana. And it yeah this is gonna f you know handy to use. Although it still has it still has the word of course at the beginning so I dunno. Um. I'd give it I'd give it a I give it a four now. Yeah. I'd say three  I mean my remote control is kinda at home is pretty terrible. If it was change my remote control of my D_V_D_ player for a Mando banana then I would be more inclined to but uh 'cause it's really bad but uh I'd say a three. It's not very promising but you know we're not young trendsetters. Is there some some formula you're using that says you have to sum them up? Well just leave it at that then. No. I think it it kind of you just lose information if you sum it  so. Well we decided against the solar cells so You mean  charging it by shaking the banana. Well maybe dynamo is like you have to actually Yeah. Well actually that that no that sample speaker is not we we're not using that  we're just using the the very beep simple beep  that s that sample thing is like the voice recording and everything. So Yeah. I say that Yeah. Mm. Well  wait a second  no  it's it's double curved  it's got a c  it's uh Well d yeah it's monotonic but it's got but if you hold it if you hold it that way that's two curved  one on this side  one on that side  but they're opposite sides. This is actually I mean this probably this probably actually costs more than three if you Yeah. Well no didn't we say we wanted to do a rubber if you drop it? Well when okay. Well we we'll come back we'll come back and see if we can fit it in. Yeah. No  we have two push buttons. Huh. Uh. Okay it's gonna have to be plastic. It's a recharger thing and uh Well I actually did um think about it myself but I thought you know because you could potentially you know you could be pushing it down as you scroll it for a instead of a turbo button but you know the turbo button does add that extra class. You know. So I mean if we're if we're over budget then maybe we could we could rethink that. Yeah. No we're not we don't need anything special for the buttons. Make it plastic instead of rubber. And then we're basically o on budget except for you know ten cents. Yeah. Yeah well pl the base station is made out of m many units of plastic. Does that include charging circuitry and everything? So what do we do with the extra profits? Okay. The next fruit. No we have a product which none of us would buy. No it's people in in in Milan and uh in Paris that are gonna buy it. We're n yeah. We're not in Milan or Paris. Actually there were a lot of That's 'cause I'm sick of Milan. Okay so um project process. Yeah. I dunno I think we had a fair bit of creativity. And uh but I think one thing we m missed out of this whole process was a um like a focus group with the actual people we're targeting. We needed some of these kind of young trendsetters to come in and play with the banana and you know see if they see if they like it. Because yeah the evaluation for us is is kind of pointless. Yeah. Because it it would also be interesting to uh you to know find out if we have a market in really young children as well  to see you know how to how to market this thing. 'Cause you know if well I mean maybe you don't wanna give all your kids their own remote because they'll be changing the channel all the time but you know maybe in some households where there is you know a T_V_ for each kid  then you know  banana remote control could be fun for them as well. Might have to draw a face on it. So but I think that's something we need to to work on next time is really finding out more about the target market. Yeah. I think there are ways we could maybe simplify the Well just the the the circuit board that we're using inside  I'm not sure really how complicated our um our needs are. I mean all we have is two push buttons and two scrollers  do we really need an integrated circuit to you know to process that. And also fo you know for mood lighting and and stuff  that would be rather cool. I think that's actually something that should be in version two  is the ability to you know to control things other than the T_V_ and not just electronic equipment but you know the whole environment of the room. Yep. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Good afternoon again. So we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control. Um So here is the agenda for today. Uh uh just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last uh meeting then we have a p presentation of prototype of you two  sounds interesting. And we'll have um presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our Marketing Experts. Then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and um hopefully uh we should fit the target o tw of twelve point five uh uh Euro. Okay. So let's go. Uh if I go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting. So we went through th uh w we took this following decisions. No L_C_D_  no speech recognition technology  okay  we went through a b to a banana look and feel for the remote control. We went through the use of wheels and but buttons. And also the use of a basis station for battery ch charging and uh also to um call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost. Okay. Um. Good. So guys let this uh wonderful thing. Oh yeah. Sorry. Um. Which is Yeah can you show it to the the camera maybe. Mm-hmm. What's the use uh of the t turbo button already? Ah yeah yeah an then you stop when you stop it stops. Uh-huh. Which one? Okay. To navigate it through th through teletext. with the wheel it's easy. Excellent. Calling. Excellent. And the the leaves plays the roles of of antennas? Oh. Great. So  what else? Yeah  they're light. Ah yeah. So for the power source  apparently you still you you want to use both solar cells and batteries. Uh you mean okay. So Yeah  where are going to where are you are you going to place them? You have enough surface? You Okay. What will be the autonomy? Roughly? The autonomy. Autonomy. Uh I mean how long does i how how how long can it be held off a station? Yeah. A long Yeah  so it's It's used only when you Yeah. F weeks. Right. Next slide? Okay. Okay. Those really sounds very good. Nothing else to add? Yeah. Well in fact b both will be could be useful  navigating through teletext. Yeah. Wow. Very good uh yeah you th yeah. Bananas everywhere. Okay  so So we have to go through now evaluations. So your slides are ready? Uh you're four I think. So this is one  which one is this one? Num number So to have in order to have enough granularity it's in order to have enough granularity in the evaluation. Okay. Okay. Yeah  six. S seven. Six. No  wait. What do you say seven? Five? Okay  six point five. Handy? Seven. So seven  seven  six  six point five. Functional. Four. Uh for a remote control  does he have all the you could expect. Yeah. So it's universal but for T_V_s. So s uh four? Five? Four. Four. Okay cool? Cool device. Yeah. Seven. Six. Plus six  I say I said seven. So it's six. Yeah. Seven. Seven. And you? Outl you are not lik outlier. Seven Okay okay okay okay. Of course I'll buy the banana. Well Twenty five Euros. Cheap. Yeah  so the target price is for all Europe  or only for rich countries? It's more targeting U_K_ or So this is selling costs  not production costs. Yeah yeah sure. Um Five. Aw  should be nice in your It's kitsch. Well  don't forget well  don't for don't forget who we're targeting also who are f f who are wh yeah  youngst youngst No well yeah I if you would be young. Not telling that you are young. Li li like a teenager for instance. Okay you're you're crazy teenager and you like fun things. Yeah. Yeah  you want to show the beautiful banana you have. Okay so you s you give oh yeah yeah I know I know. So you say two. F I d I say five. You say? So what's the new question? Uh yeah  I think so. Yeah that's two different question. Ugly. I stick to five. W we have six  five Three So we are six  five  four Yeah. So So and last question  will I change my rem change my remote control from Mando banana. Um  zero. No uh we can't. So one. Well if. No uh let's say I'll put two. It's for the T_V_. Two three five two three fi and two. So it's r Yeah  three point five. No no you say five  he is the outlier. Okay just just do a sum. Well maybe we should we should uh have a look globally glob Yeah. So maybe maybe w we can we should stick to general feeling. We can had uh have a out of these numbers  which which is that well we should go for it. Problem with connectors? Okay. So let's move uh let's move on. Okay  now now we have to mm to estimate uh the cost okay. So I prepare an Excel sh uh an Excel sheet. Um well we are going to calculate the production costs. We should we should be below twelve point five. So I already uh put some pu some numbers here  okay. We are going to go through so this is the number the mm number of components we need for this thing. So it appears that there were things that we didn't thought about. Uh and also things that I uh I d I forget to uh to put like solar cells. Oh yeah finally we say no. Okay so let's let's go let's go let go through all the lines. So hand dynamo. This something we didn't thought about. But Yeah. Yeah. Okay so we we stick to battery  one. No kinetic also. I don't I don't see the difference between kinetic and dynamo. Ah you have to ah okay I see so kinetic is really uh shaking the banana. Crazy. Okay. So those banana is falling. Let's go ahead. So we we st only have one for battery. Uh then for electronics um so I didn't put anything for the. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. No so we hin Yeah so one. Ooh ye ye ye the cost is increasing. So we are The beep. That's what Okay so I'll remove it. S So don't we need a Oh there is no listing for r radio frequency thing. So Yeah maybe. We'll see later. Okay so in for the case um I put single curved. Because we have two things. No. Well. What a what i if I put one here. Yeah so let's put one here in the then instead of single oka all right. So we stick to plastic  it cost nothing. No  it's too no. It's too expensive. We're already at eleven. Okay so I put rubber one. Okay so special colour  yellow. Uh for the interface we have We have three. No no. We have two scroll  and we have three push buttons. And No it's no chip. This is just radio frequency. Th This is no chip. It's just Yeah. No. Just only. Okay w we didn't think a thought about uh integrated scroll wheel push buttons. Yeah  so Yeah. Okay. So no L_C_D_  so for we have no button supplements  right? Uh well in fact could we could not we consider this button as a button supplement because oh no  these are these are for colours  co and special forms  special colours and special materials. So Okay so we are over budget. Yeah. Yeah. So mayb in fact n we have to put two here because it cost nothing. Exactly exactly so we have margin for that stuff. Yeah maybe. Okay good. Wha Excellent. Um we'll invest in R_ and D_. Yeah. So well we're under the the the cost. So we can go to through to project evaluation. Sorry? Which is different. Which is different. None of us will buy it. This is a battery. This is what we which you can mm It did yeah. Extra battery  yeah. Exac Well in fact I I did not know I didn't know really what to say here. If uh if you have any ideas of what we can we can say. So I don't I don't I don't understand what what they mean by satisfaction um and for and for example. Should it be more like um like a status of of the these meetings in fact. Yeah well in fact uh we we use a little bit the white board and the digital pen  not that much. Oh yeah it's really creative. Yeah. Yeah maybe we should go through  yeah an uh evaluation. So maybe you should we should do a kinda evaluation in the streets like asking to young peoples well  do you like to have a banana as a remote control. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yep. Any any new ideas we could uh we could investigate next time? Dunno  oranges? Hmm. Okay. Very good. So Well done. I think we we can go home. Yeah. Maybe maybe we can hassle the the production department to to make a a real prototype that we can use at home to to evaluate. Okay so thanks very much. Bye. ,As the meeting opens the project manager tells the group that they must stay within the budget of twelve Euro and fifty cents or will have to redesign. After Matthew arrives the designers begin presenting the two prototypes  beginning with the basic conventional one which is shaped like a surfboard and costs 7 or 8 Euros to produce. It contains an on-off button  volume switch  up/down channel function  10 digits  and two extra buttons for teletext and an additional function. The next control is futuristic because feels like a mobile phone  has 6 keys  and is smooth. It also has a power button  channel up/down  slow pause/slow stop  LCD screen  toggle switch that changes it from audio to video  and microphone. It would cost 16 Euros to produce  which is out of the budget. The marketing expert gives the product evaluation and they rate them on look and feel  innovation  ease of use  appeal to the correct demographic  and adherence to the company motto and fashion trends. They discuss the energy source  shape  chip type  LCD and speech recognition  and additional buttons. After choosing features their remote costs 12 Euros to produce. They close the meeting by thanking one another. 
Okay. So we are here for the concept design meeting. So  we will first start by summarizing the mm the previous meeting and the decision we've taken. Uh I will take notes during this meeting so uh that you can uh look at my uh folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards. So each of you will uh show us the various investigation they've done during uh previous uh hours. We'll then t take decision in concert and then uh uh we will uh define the nest next task  to have to be done before the next meeting. So  last time we decided to have a simple interface. We also decided to have a wheel to change channel previous channel button. Channel digit uh buttons should be uh protected by plastic cover or something for the remote control to look very simple. We have also button for volume  and to switch on off the T_V_. We have also uh the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find  and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no L_C_D_ no voice features. So now uh we will have three presentations. So the conceptual specification by Industrial Designer  the specification of the U_I_ by or U_I_ okay. And uh the last point is uh trend watching by Market Expert. So maybe we can start with uh industrial design. So this is the presentation. Maybe I can switch slide uh on your request. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. But is it a significant price on the whole remote control? Because we can afford up to twelve Euros for the price of the remote control. So will will will this with uh including all possible things  so buttons  wheel and the chip  be uh lower than twelve Euros to produce? Okay You received something Hmm. And could it be adapted? Okay and there can uh recognize some commands and stuff? Okay. Yeah. Okay maybe we can just uh listen to this presentation and then take decision later on according to those news. Okay. You can easily find the button in the dark or so? It will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control I think  no? Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. True. But it can be uh battery consuming  no? To have the light always on? Well we will discuss that after maybe the other presentations. Yeah. And it is. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And also does it uh fit well in hand? Because it was uh th your wrist problem with the usage. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it's only the central part. Yeah. With a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. S Okay. Will be down or Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Mm. Yeah. Maybe the wheel will be a good advantage over our competitors. Because otherwise it's pretty standard apart the fact that it's very simple. So maybe it's worse to uh to have more expense on that's that aspect. Okay. So we can move to the Is there any question? For designer of user interface? or we can move to the next part  maybe  and discuss afterwards? Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. This is good also for Yeah. I think it is good also f to have a spongy material  yeah. Yeah  because it's robust. Yeah uh sorry? No. Yeah. Before? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's innovative to use the mm the wheel because I think no one else has. Has it? Yeah. I think it's it makes it both easy and both innos innovative. So I think it's a good aspect and it should be kept. Cool  fancy? We have to make it l look like a fruit or vegetable. Maybe uh um a colour that remember some fruit uh  things like that. Maybe yeah. Yeah  and it's ergonomic as well. A pear. Yeah. Maybe pear yeah or something like that. Yeah. We can discuss that uh. D D Is is there anything you want to add? I don't think so. I think we we can have like yeah a pear is good  fit well  or banana as you told. Something like that. But that's not in the trend.. The trend is spongy  and vegetable fruits. I think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well. So  I think we can keep the wheel because it's uh easy  it's innovative  even if the cost is a bit higher  and we also have to find a  so  a fruit like pear or banana wit uh any others idea you have. What kind of fr fruit would you like to to control your T_V_ with? Odi Banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then. I think it's a good idea  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's a good design and it's innovative as well then. Maybe we can keep the banana. And it will be very easy to find. Yeah. Yeah it's really uh really a good point. I think it So One second. So we have to take some decision on this aspect. So  uh so for sorry  for uh component  so we have to think about those aspects  sorry. Yeah. I think it's the box that should be spongy  banana's shape. But No the button would be In fact it it should be something odd shaped  with a spongy cover. Okay odd shape with spongy cover. And standard battery okay  a chip imprint  there's no specific problem. So we agree to put the wheel So it have to it has to be symmetrical. Yeah maybe the thumb is more comfortable. Yeah I think it's okay for both right and left. Mm. I think you can turn it this way also. You can do both with both hands. I think it's okay. Well  you you will get used to it. And moreover  th the button ar are lighted so you you immediately identify the right side  because you have light on buttons. Yeah. No you you I think you will use it only on the right or left hand  whether you are righty or lefty. I think for lefty it's okay. I can do this movement  and for righty as well. I think this doesn't change that much. Yeah? So  for interface we said also that we have uh this banana shape with button on the s on the side. And and uh a wheel on the top. So the colour is yellow. I think it's uh we defined everything according to what we should what the decision we should take  yeah. So maybe we can um we can uh work on those aspects uh until next meeting. So have the final uh look and feel design according to the decision. And have the the user interface design and uh then evaluate the prodyuc the product. That is to say  uh check if it fit the the requirement uh given by the users  but according to uh your presentation it seems to be okay. It seems to be fancy  innovative  and easy to use. So so to prepare the prototype I would suggest that the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer uh work together. That would uh be better  I think. And uh And so uh you will receive further instruction by emails  as usual. So do you need to add anything? You feel okay? You feel uh free to express what you want to say? You don't feel too constrained? You don't feel free to answer this? Okay  so See you. Uh  I_D_ you want? Yeah. I only v have three slides  so. I just look at the mm um just this. On some web pages to find some documentation and I think a remote control is  as I s mentioned previously  you just have a a very simple chip and the mm the user interface is just done usually by push button and in our case we are using a um a wheel control. So uh uh I was looking basically for that chip  which is uh very very standard  and uh I just looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button. And um yeah we can change directly. In fact I have the number of that element which is very standard for remote control. The push button are usually extremely cheap  but I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor  which seems to be quite expensive. And I think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not if if we could combine something with the push button. Uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button. Yeah. Yeah I I th But I don't think that uh we should We should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money. But Um that's all yeah. I haven't chec Mm-hmm. Yeah but I think it's yeah Sorry  I haven't written my personal references. Um the I I just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button  and if we could reduce that. We we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button. Just to to make something which is uh slightly more design that uh a squarey box with a rubber Yeah. Actually. As soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light. Yeah. Again. I don't think that this is really expensive  but at the end this is plenty of unexpen eh very cheap devices but uh the bill starts to be First of all I was thinking to have a a continuous light and you w when t you you you you press the on button you have the light on your remote control  when you want to turn off your device Yeah  a little bit. A little bit. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. To s Mm-hmm. I support an apple. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Me too. Ah it's okay. I know that they do that for alarm clock also. Yeah. Mm-hmm. What about um And for maybe look and feel  what about a a piece of ice  with blue L_E_D_ inside? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Banana I think  it's a nice idea. Because But You y you don't use the banana when the banana is curving like that  but when the banana is curving like that  with the wheel on the top and to control  and here you have a a push button to Yeah. And everybody knows what is a banana. Basically. If you if you start with uh fancy fruits and fra s and tha Oh  yeah So So we will just use a a standard battery? And uh the chip we chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use. Uh what do you mean by case? Yeah. Uh I mean for me if we use a a spongy banana case  doesn't matter. I just want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box  and that's it. Yeah yeah. Yeah. Spongy also. Oh no I think it's possible. Yeah. Yeah. This is uh like the Mm-hmm. Wheel on the top. Button  where do we want some buttons? Yeah. Yep. Yep. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Abdul al-Hasred is my name. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Also have to say Did you receive the email about the voice recognition? No? Yeah. You we uh an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed. Says Yeah. It says that ri right now they just use it to uh to record uh answers to particular questions. But I guess it could be I guess it's possible. I mean instead of recording the answers you can just uh record uh something simpler like a command. Yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff  so if they already have it as uh as a chip then we we could use it. Okay. Mm-hmm. I have a question about that actually. Um  what is the purpose of the light? Is But But in th in the dark uh Yeah but is going to be always turned on  the light? But if you move it then you have it  you don't need to find it. You can see the buttons better  of course. Yeah. But if you move it then you have to have some sensor to when you move it to detect your movement. Yeah  but you need another sensor for that  right? Yeah no it's too expensive. Okay. Mm. Extra. Yeah  okay. Mm. Yeah  but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so  yeah. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Okay. So uh my one  it uh should be in the shared folder. So. It was last time I saw it. Okay. So  just move to the next slide. So basically want very simple  right? That's the major idea  as simple as possible. So I just look at some current designs uh on the web  of usually more complicated remote controls. And let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple. And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler. Um. So. Yeah. Well this these uh these remotes are quite big  so go to the next page  so. We have all these buttons as you can see  but most of them  we just need the ones in the middle. So  from the bottom or whatever is there  uh the uh the numbers and then the top  uh until the ten also  this middle part  and on the left one is exactly the same. So it's basically more or less how we would like it  with a big volume control  big channel control  and mute and power  yeah? These are the basic thing. So basically  w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two. Yeah  if you have  for example I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb. It could be on the right side  for example. Yeah. Because we don't have these input buttons and this other stuff that they have. And I think that the plastic cover is not very good uh idea because you open it  it can break  you ca you can do various things. Uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way. So that they're separate a bit  yeah. Uh and it's easy to press the other the big buttons  but uh  it's not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either. Mm. Yeah  I think that if you put the cover it will be even more difficult for the user. Alright  you won't yeah. Usually what I have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally don't mess with  like buttons for t uh tuning the channels and stuff like that. Yeah. That you want to protect a bit. And I think it's uh it's reasonable. So  I don't think Yeah  this is just the the wheel. We could use the some wheels can be pushed down  could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want. Uh so we could just basically use one just wheel and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case. Yeah  I guess the market researcher will tell us all about that. Mm-hmm. Well  wou wou I think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing  it it would work  right? Yeah. You can throw it to the television. Hey that's a cool one. We could say that if you throw it  you have a sensor  and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off. When it d uh takes a shock. Yeah. How do we make it look cool is the question. Yeah. Well the obvious thing is a banana  I guess. The banana is also ergonomic. Is there any fruit that is spongy? Yeah. You can make it um It's not hard  the metal. Plastic. Mm. Yeah. Two of the button  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah so you can just have uh just have this curve  yeah  and you move uh your hand here to press the buttons and then you move uh on the other side. So you can have it on on two sides and it'll be cool  no? You can put also vibrator inside. Ah-ha. You can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company. Yeah. I hope the students of management die  but anyway. Now who are recording this meeting? The only th Yeah. Y Yeah that can be in inside th in the structure. But uh the thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be I mean if it's spongy then the buttons and the wheel have to I mean if it's spongy then it's going to move  right? So  it's going to be bend a lot. So if we try to push the buttons  it You think it's possible? Okay. Yeah. Well  usually hold 'Kay  we want it to be good also for the left-hand users  right? Uh Yeah but okay. Sa let's say that th o It has to be basically you can only take two sides  one on ths this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is uh yeah also the thumb. Basically. Or you could use use this one  but I don't know if it's very comfortable  to use this one for the wheel. This for the wheel and then this for the buttons? Should have the two sides. So if the left  we have the op Wheel Wheel buttons. Yeah  the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around  the buttons are on the other side. So you cannot see them. Yeah. So the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be Y Yeah I know  but uh if you hold with your left hand  and the wheel is here  and the buttons are here  then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side. Okay. Okay. Maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yes master. No. Yeah. Yeah. No. Maybe you can make uh uh mm okay. Okay  I can go? Can I? So now the recent investigation we we have done fo of the remote control um. So  the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel. And um the second aspect is uh that the remote control should be uh technological innovative. And the third most important aspect is to to is that the co remote control should be easy to use. So  are things we are we have uh speak about before. Yeah. And um so you you can go after. And there is a fashion watchers in Paris and Milan that have detected the following trends  uh fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes  shoes  and furnitures. So  maybe if our remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form something like that  or And the mm the material is expected to be spongy. Uh I don't know which material can be spongy  and if you Mm-hmm. Okay It's robust  yeah. Not good. An and and uh this uh you can yeah you can say that. You ca uh you can go uh before  before  yes. And you know here the more iz important aspect is the fancy look and feel  after is uh technological innovative  and after the easy to use. Yeah that's why Yeah that's why I think we have to keep that if it's possible. Innovative. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Oh  colour  yeah. Oh i i I thought about a a pear  for example. You know the pear  is like that and it's it's easy to to have in in hand and uh Yeah. Or a fruit like that. I dunno. Yeah. But you don't have Yeah. ,Customers are willing to pay more for fancier looking remotes. They like innovative technology like speech recognition and LCD screens. It also transpires that remotes are easy to lose. Everyone agreed that they need to incorporate a locating mechanism in their design  and that changeable covers could make appealing-looking remotes. The need for clarity of button functions was mentioned. On the other hand  materials should be more durable. The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip  and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared. There are some new requirements: the target group will be people below 40  the device will have to be for TV only  they should ignore the teletext function  and  also  the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product. They drew some of their ideas  and discussed the positioning of the buttons and the LCD. The most used buttons are going to be placed on top. It might be possible to use a charger for the remote. The concept of the design will be finalised in the next meeting. 
Mm yeah. Nope  we're all set. Which which is the clunky one  the one on left or on the right?.. Okay. No. I'll add it later  I guess the presentation. No. No. Um function F_ eight. Function  the blue button. Next to the control on the left. Yeah. You have to push it together. Yep. Nope. Try that again. Wait. Yep  there we go. Increase that 'cause we can't see the That's much better. There you go. Bouncing on top. Is installing a new remote control something that people Um  I think it'll be the mid range to the high end market  in terms of people. 'Cause twenty five Euros for a remote  how much is that lo locally in pounds? Is that too is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote or a replacement remote? Right. Um so maybe not the high end range  but maybe middle  middle up-ish. Kind of. You know how much? I dunno I guess you pay  what  ten ten quid for a remote? Like a simple replacement  right. I mean if you lost your remote and the first thing you just wanna go out and get  would you how much would you pay? Yeah. Yep. I I think twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as a group as well because that's more than half your group of people who are willing to at least try and use your technology. Yeah. I think perhaps that age group is significant as well because those are people who use the computer  who are familiar with their with computers in in their everyday work. I think people who are maybe about I wouldn't say thirty five  but people who are about forty-ish and above now would not be so dependent and reliant on a computer or a mobile phone or something like that. So these are people who are gadgety  right? People who are u growing up used to  you know in schools and in universities  when you go on to their working lives  people who would you know regular Yeah. Yeah. Mm. I I think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now  because um  based on what you've go y everybody's saying  right  you want something simple. You want basic stuff and you want something that's easy to use. Speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use. Um  but what I'm saying is that we're we're trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology  rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say  and then  you know  say speech recognition is good for this  speech recognition is not good for this. So maybe we should I suggest that we think about speech recognition  anyway it's a it's something that can be used to fulfil a function  but at end of the day we don't look at the technology  but we look at the function first. Okay  sure. Sorry  do you mind passing me my notepad. Thanks. Cool  um. Okay. Um. Well this is just the working design um. Well this is just what how I would go about it. Um I guess I try to define like what we're doing now  try to define what we're trying to get done. Um I think in a practical way  we kind of know what it is. We've used it  we're familiar with it  but we're we can't n we haven't narrowed down um exactly what the things we're trying to fulfil  like Besides the basics  I think back in the back of our minds we know what the basics are. Has to change channels  has to change volume  but in like specifics  right  which one of the basics are you trying to target. Um are there certain parts of the basics that are more important or less important than the basics? Um and I just the idea is just to get everybody to um I usually have a have have a design that's there as a basic  so  you know  things that to start everything going. But I guess everybody does have some idea  so I don't think um there's a need for that. Um okay this finding things is a little bit confusing  so I'll go into the diagram first. It just explains how the process goes through  from a from the basic technology point of view  the basic steps that you need um in the diagram and in this slide probably works better. Um okay  you need some power source. 'Kay  a battery or something  to keep it going. Um and that power source is important because it ties you down to um how long the device will last. Um it ties you down perhaps a bit later on in terms of the technologies um how far you can transmit the signal or the complexity of the functions that you want. Like for example  voice recognition  right. That might be constrained because that you might need to power a microphone  you might need to power other things  so that's one perhaps constraint there. Um Th Okay  the basic thing is there's a user interface where people punch a button or talk into it or smile to it or blink their eyes  whatever. You know  and that um picks up an input from a user  um uh a logic a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device  and the device has to r you know  based on you push button A_  so I will do something with button A_. So maybe button A_ is the power button  okay. Um and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself which is the receiver here. Um and I think that's about it in terms of my design um. It's fairly general  um and I guess the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in in the way you're thinking  like um voice recognition  right  um  if it's something which is important then we just add more power rather than having a thing that we don't have enough power. So it's not really a constraint in that sense  but I mean these are functionally  you know  the base  what the technology has to do. Um so I guess the rest of it I think we should maybe you you wanna go back to what the functions are? I think that's more relevant to a discussion? Yeah  w I'm done. More or less. Yeah. Ps Oh  it's just putting the rest of it into words  but it's essentially the same thing. Um you have a transmitter  an input device  logic chip  you know  stuff like that. Um I guess this would be Yep. Um  these these aren't technology options in that sense. This is just um a basic principles and basic components that are needed. For example  if you needed um if you needed to add uh a voice recognition  right  then your user interface would be split  broken down into more components  right  which you have a microphone  the V_R_ and stuff like that. Uh Yep. Yep. So each component represents one function  but I think the basic functions are the logic  the transmitter  um and the receiver  okay  and the power are things that you won't have to care about. Um and those are things that based on what your user interface requires then we'll add more functionality to it. Um there might be one other consideration which would be that the the transmission between the remote control and the T_V_ for example. Okay  um are we gonna restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infra-red thing? Because that's something you need to actually be physically be pointing to. Right. Yep. There might be one other problem with the transmission  um in particular right now  since we're talking about voice recognition. Um if somebody's gonna h talk to the device  you ideally want them to hold it to them. I it you may not require that  but you know  um it's it's it's something very natural  I guess  you know  to hold it  to signal to the user  and push a button maybe to start s talking about it. Then you need to send the signal out  so because if you're using infra-red  the line of sight um say the T_V_'s at that chair  and I'm standing in front of here and the transmitter is here  it blocks it. So in that sense  there's not really a restriction but it's something which you may have to think about later on in the process. Not so much further down. There's there's not much specific specific information  but I think that um one indication of infra-red mean that you're just targeting traditional devices. Because infra-red is something which everybody has. There's a there's Okay  from from a from a component point of view there's added complexity  and you add cost to it  um and then there's probably the fact that you need another physical component. You need a docking cradle  for example  for you to put it in to charge. Or you need to get the user to plug it in. Um and most users are very f use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller. But unless the controller's gonna consume a lot of batteries  like he's gonna run through like twenty batteries a month  then I don't think rechargeable is something we should you know  we really need to care about. Um. Okay  I think Another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls? Um maybe I could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories. One would be audio controls  one would be video controls  and the other one would be a device. Um this may not map very well to advanced functionality especially  but I think that um from a manufacturer's point of view  from a person designing the device  but I think from a point of view of a person using the device  you know a T_V_ is something they see and something they hear  um it's something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off. I mean like so what we could have is like three buckets  right  where we could throw things into  like if we want this feature  let's throw it into there  and then from there decide whether it's basic  or it's non-basic. I mean it might help with the visualisation. And it would actually help with the component build as well. Mm no  not really. Mm. Um things like on off. Because they don't have anything to do with what you see. I me mean in terms of picture and the entertainment value  you know  um so um And channel. Because the on off also goes  you know  like on off like power  not on off sound. Not on off video. Although you don't turn off the video on your T_V_  but um you might wanna you know turn off the sound  say you wanna pick up the phone  there's a mute button  right  so you you have you have a choice of putting it on to um others or a device. Device is basically anything which we can't categorise  right. We put it out. Yeah  anything to do with what you hear  right. You you put that into audio. And then video is anything that you can see. Um. Yep. Yep. Yep. Like random which we have no other place to put  but we need it somewhere there. Um even even if it doesn't map very clearly what happens is that people at least have some in their mind. It's easy to use  I think that's one thing that um and I guess from the component point of view it's easy to build as well 'cause things are like fixed. Could you plug me in? Okay. Thanks. Okay. 'Kay. Okay. And the slogan  like the actual written slogan  or just to embody the idea of the slogan? 'Bout putting the fashion in electronics. Sure. Right. Mm-hmm. M yeah  like a lot of a lot of what I've um read and prepared for this meeting fits in really closely with what with what Craig's just gone over. So in part I could I could give you some of my personal preferences but I could also th add some to this which is just about sort of um sort of market research. But anyway  um we might come to that later. Um clunky in what sense  like um h heavier? Larger? I see  so it's more just basic. Right  okay. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Which was that? Up the numbers  or the up down? Yeah. Yeah. We don't? No? Yeah. Well I think I think es essentially what we're doing right now is we're categorising. We're saying well we want this to be a product that offers all the sort of more tricky features but we want them to be in another area? Is that right? Is that what we're we're doing? We're kind of like sorting them an Or are we actually eliminating things we just don't want the product to have? Yeah. Yep. Well  one one way I would look at this um would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of um like control types  so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go. Uh and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible. For example if we had audio controls  those could be something people set up very rarely. Maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up um  things like channel and volume um are used all the time  so we just have them right out on top  um very just very sort of self-explanatory. Um so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls  you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip. And others that are uh also available and then others that are concealed. Something like that. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Sure. Can this can this pl reach? Can this plug come across? No. So why don't I just pick up and move then. Here  I'll just Why don't I just Mm er  can you go up behind me? Kinda This is so This I'm all in a knot now. Okay. Um. So I can I can say already  I dunno whether this is for good or for bad but there'll be a lot of kind of uh redundancy in the in the the issues and the the uh the things. Yeah  yeah. Which is ma not necessarily a bad thing  but may what I've already started doing is cr I created a slide in in my presentation here so um so that we kind of think well what's the cumulative effect of what we've taken from your ideas and and mine  because certainly I I have a hard time separating separating things completely. Obviously obviously what you've just told me what you've just told me impacts a lot on what um like market research mm that that I've been So how do I how do I get this up? Okay. Okay. Alright. So F_ eight? Oh  and F_ eight. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay  I think that that's doing it now. Uh  again? Okay. Um  okay great. Okay. Just um Before I bring this up what I'll just say is um what I've what I've done is tried to collect some information so that I can then relay this to to you guys so that it's now becomes a collective thing. And then kind of lead us in the direction of deciding  'kay what what are our options  what should we decide and do you know what I mean  so. Okay. Okay. Alright. That would be Okay. So um does that make sense? So what I basically got is I just looked into some information and sort of th tried to think about how how we could review it and how we could and what kind of decisions we could take away from it and then maybe by the end of just looking at some of these things we can think about what are our priorities. 'Cause certainly there's lots of different information to go through. So um I'm thinking here about uh primarily about customer needs  that we start with the customer  and w you know  what they want and what are issues with with um existing products. Uh to think about trends and also about try and connect that as you see with the company vision which is about fashion in electronics. Um and then  as I say uh w we'd like to prioritise our design features from this and um Dunno. Okay. Um. So this is what I've found here  um a lot of this is new to me  so we'll just read through together. Um  users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls. So they find them ugly. Most people find them ugly. Um the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well  we'll see later  the vast majority would spend more money for um slightly more intuitive control  such as voice recognition. Okay I'm gonna we'll look at that in a second. Um most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls. So I guess what we're looking at here is people want this h technology  they tend to use the most simple controls and overall they find remote controls to be something they don't doesn't really appeal to them. So I think what we're doing is we're trying to take like if for me this is sorta like three different different um inspirations  you know  one is that we want uh something that's high-tech but we want it to seem easy. And in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side  we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands. Um  frustrations. They get lost a lot  s as it came up in our last meeting. Um  takes time to learn how to use them. This is uh why I mention when Craig was uh showing us some ideas that we actually try and group controls  so d it doesn't just look like a big panel  kinda like when you you look at  you know  a new computer keyboard  or something that is quite explanatory. If you want audio  if you want visual  then you have those. Um and I will admit I don't know what R_S_I_ stands for. Uh  no  that did not come up at all. Um so here here is another um sort of a a review here of the main things. I also found that most people would uh adults at least would pay more for voice recognition. Now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control. So I dunno if that's possible we might consider getting into it. Um. And and again here as we sort of move m sort of thin start thinking about how we wanna sell and market this  I think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be wants us to make something that's fashionable and sleek and trendy. Um people uh additionally aren't aren't liking the appearance of their products  so we wanna think about as we take all the sort of the techie features how we can um put that into a unit which is which people like. You know  they like the aesthetics and the ergonomics. Yeah. Yeah  so you know just c looking at what what Craig um Craig's i uh ideas are s sorta tell me that maybe what we wanna do is try and um separate the different things that we wanna include in this. So if we do say well we want there to be all the technology will we try and make that almost be like optional technology. You know  it's like like I find a lot of T_V_s these days  something really like about 'em is if you wanna just turn 'em on and off you can  but they have little panels where you click and there's just like tons of features you go through. Yeah. Yeah. That's s that's sort of the um But I I'm my hope here is that I'm putting out this information so that we can then say okay  well how do we collectively move on with it. Um I I haven't brought out one specific marketing idea  although my sense is that what we should try and think about is what are the current trends in materials and shapes and styles  and then use that. But not let that confine us technologically. So Alright? Any um comments on all of that? That's uh Yeah. Okay. Where's the money  maybe. Yeah. And who watches T_V_. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. This this kinda touches on your comments there  David. These are the age groups which we have information on and these are this is a table of h what people would pay more for a certain feature. Just gives us a rough idea of where the w the will to spend money on T_V_ equipment is. Mostly focused around the twenty five age group. Sort of young professional  kind of. Mm-hmm Uh  yeah  it's the Yep. It does it does fit with the market that we're sort of identifying  in terms of Okay. Yeah. Sure. Sure. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But yeah. Yeah  sure. Mm-hmm. Yeah. If we can. Yeah. Right. Could it be an on off thing? Like if you want it on Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Sure. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Sure. Yep. Yep. Yeah  it's good well it's good to get ideas out while they're fresh in mind. Um Not Yeah. And not losing. And also it helps in terms of people not losing this  you know they they're saying oh it's I lose it in the couch. like we're kind of what we're b sort of getting in into here is mating different uh design features together that they Right. Oh really  you've seen one before. Right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. Sure. Sure. Yep. Right. And like on the means b Since we're on the topic of the technology  uh are there any like what are our options? Alright  what's what i in Is this the only way that we go about it  or are there other thin Right. The basic principle of 'Kay. Right. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Right. Right. Right. Right. Okay. And um just a clarification before we finish this. Uh does c is our controller is it have the option of being um on a standard uh frequency as all of the other equipment  so that the one controller can control several pieces of equipment? Okay. Just to T_V_  okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah  that's good. And is it going to include any of the uh the more advanced features  or are we gonna eliminate those? Okay. R is it is it is it s is it not an option still that we include some things just as a sort of under like sort of under a door or some 'Cause what what I'm I'd be a bit worried about is if someone was h had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they  you know  w they get ours and w it's doesn't have that. I dunno if that'd be a problem. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Right. Yeah. 'Kay  okay. Like that. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm okay  great. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Um yeah  just I just wanted to ask then before we wrap up  shall we agree for sake of um sort of clarity and when we when we r resume that we'll u use this idea David's proposed  where we think of these three sort of buckets and anything anything we discuss about them is sort of  okay  we're talking about this. Shall we do that  then? Okay  great. And and channel. Right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Colour  yeah. Sure. Sure. Okay. And then k I suppose quite likely what would happen is in the d device category there might be some which are just like the habitual standard and then others which are maybe a bit more Yeah. Sure  okay. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Great. Then we get to go find out what was picked up for lunch for us. I'll go first. Alright um  can I st steal this from the back of your laptop? Uh so this is the technical functions design. Um Right to do the um the design I have I've had a look online  I've had a look at the homepage  which has given us um some insp inspiration from previous products. Um I've had a look at the previous products to see what they offer and um I would like to ask you guys for um your ideas about the design at the end of the meeting. Um unfortunately we're not allowed to talk outside the meeting room  so Um  having a look at the existing products  I found out that um it tends to come in sort of two extremes  there's either um a very complicated one that's got lots of buttons  lots of colours  very confusing  you don't know what you're doing. Um in that case the the labelling tends to be very bad. Um there's an example I'll show you at the end  um sh show you now. Uh here um the button there and there. This one's prog. Sorry. That one's perg and that one's prog  and it doesn't really tell you what it does. Um  not sure if you had a a look at the other um control in that example. Um it's a very simple one. It's got only the basic functions mm but um it's the same size as the the hard to use one. Uh it looked a bit clunky. They're very big and not very much use for buttons. Um  and it's just very hard to access the advanced functions. There's there's nothing for instance for a slow motion button. Um  my own preferences  I prefer the the clunky one. Um it's very easy to use. Um but unfortunately it does lack the advanced functions which I I quite like having on the controls. Um so I believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer  or something like tha from the bottom of it. So  now I'd like to ask for your preferences. Um not sure of how long we've got  uh Um  the clunky one is the one on the right. Um I think it's supposed to be the same size  but um it's got much fewer buttons. It's  you know  it's very spread out and kind of you know  I get the idea it'd be sort of about this size. got very few buttons on it and Um  do we have any functions that um we'd want on it? I mean so far I've got um on and off  um switch the channel up and down  and put the volume up and down. Um they're just the the very basics you could use for a T_V_. Okay. Um  you say that's a h a required one or a requested one? Would you like um the channels like the the numbers on thing  um Um  yeah. Um Uh  to start with um sort of a bit both  um we need to find out exactly what we have to have um and after that we can add things if they're possible. There's um on and off  um volume and channel  and skip to certain channels with the numbers. Do you want to switch places? Just just switch them. Think maybe the the wire in the back might be loose. Um Well  did you not say it was the the adults that were going for the the voice recognition? Sort of the the older group. Uh f Yeah. I reckon one problem with speech recognition is um I've actually seen one of them used and uh the technology that was in that one wasn't particularly amazing  so you end up yelling at the control for hours. Channel up. Um I think it'd probably quite expensive to put in. Um. I think we just say that it was gonna be the the most basic stuff possible. Um on off  up and down channels  up and down volume and uh skip to a channel. Ta. Um I think we include mute  but apart from that um I think we just we'll go for the simpleness. Yeah. Um just about the three buckets  um what would go in the the device functions one? Um Is that alright now? Okay. Sorry? Okay  everybody all set to start the meeting? Okay  we've got half an hour for this one um to uh discuss the um functional design. All ready to go? Okay. Um so hopefully you've all been working away  and I've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder. Um so I guess just to to recap on uh what we did last time. Um kind of uh got to know each other a little bit and uh got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss um a bit about the project  you know  cost-wise how much how much money we had to s Um just want to tell you that you have three new requirements  um which is the The first one is that um uh the company's decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how popular the internet is. Nobody uses teletext very much anymore  so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control. Um they've also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television  not the V_C_R_  D_V_D_ or anything else. I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect um how long it takes us to get it into into production  the time to market. So um  we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the T_V_. And the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design. Um I'm not entirely sure what the corporate colour is. It might be yellow  because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere. Well that's the thing  I'm I'm not sure um uh th because on the the company website  uh what does it say Uh something Yeah  I mean do they Is that something they want actually written on it  'cause it's quite long. Um or yeah  just the idea  but I'm not sure. So that's something we can discuss as well. So those are the three things  just not to worry about teletext  uh only control the T_V_  and um and uh incorporate the uh colour and slogan of the company. Um so is everybody okay with any of that  or do you want me to recap at all? Right um  time for presentations then. Who would like to go first? Okay  cool. Oh yeah  of course  yeah. G go on ahead. Mm-hmm. Okay. Alright. Oop. Um. Well we can chat away for uh for five minutes or so I think at at most. Just a couple of minutes anyway. Mm-hmm. Shall we sh well we'll stick to kind of your area for now. Yeah. Looks kind of Yeah. Well I think it's a valid point. I mean like the one on the left looks quite um quite complicated  and that P_R_T_ p P_R_O_T_ thing is incredibly confusing. Um so I see I see why yo you know you might prefer the simpler design  but yeah you don't want to lose out on  you know  what it does  so maybe you know you know you get a lot of remote controls where you kind of flip the thing open  I think that's a good idea. I think it's a good idea. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Uh-huh  and then actual numbers for channels as well  yeah. God  I wou I would say that's required  I mean there's no way anybody's gonna buy a remote control these days when if you can't actually individually select channels  I mean would anybody disagree with that? Um  what else  uh So don't need to worry about teletext  don't need to worry about V_C_R_  uh any kind of like display controls at all do you think we need to worry about  you know like brightness and contrast? Mm. Yeah. I think are you are you maybe kind of thinking what we absolutely have to have and what would be nice? Mm-hmm. Okay  right. Well  do you wanna maybe just  at this point decide on what we absolutely must have as a p as a function of this. Um  so so far  just to recap you've got volume and channel control and Right okay. Um Mm-hmm yeah. Oka Mm-hmm. Okay. Uh well  just to to wrap up quickly on this this little section Have I just lost Oh no. Um  uh do you think maybe that's the only kind of uh essential requirements  and then maybe just things that would be nice if it could do would be things like audio set up and display set up and things like that  maybe like a mute button  that sort of thing. Any of you anything to add to that at all? No. Okay  right. Um okay  if we can move on to next presentation then please. Um Do you wanna Probably not  actually. Yeah. bit complicated. It'd be nice if everything was wireless  wouldn't it? Right. Oh  like overlap between what you said? Oh well  for all you know that that'll happen. Mm hard to know what where your role ends  yeah. Okay. Uh pr yeah  press function and F_ eight  yeah. Mm. Yeah  you wanna Oh oh here we go. There you go. Um Okay. Right. Can you um Right  okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Repetitive strain injury. Mm-hmm. Okay. So want something that looks good and is easy to use  big priorities. Okay. Mm. So it you wanna group all the different kind of types of functions together  you know. That's I think it's a good idea. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Right. Well  um one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're gonna be um who's our our target audience  our target market. Um  so if we want something that that looks good and is easy to use  but has y is fairly powerful product  whatever  who do we really want to aim that at? I mean Yeah  who wou who would have the money to spend. Well i if if like twenty five Euro is our is our selling price then you can imagine  well I don't I'm not really sure how much that will retail at. But you want it's somebody who's not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly  I suppose  they're gonna actually go out and buy one. So  who do you think we're aiming this at? It's about sixteen  seventeen pounds  I think. Yeah  okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah  yeah. Okay Okay. Yeah  so do you think we're we're aiming at a fairly young market then? Yeah  okay. Um do you think then uh voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider? What what do you think  Craig? N yeah. I think we are gonna have to narrow it down  to say let's target these people and give them what they want and 'cause you know  there needs to be some kind of selling point to it. So um anybody anything there to add Just kind of young professionals  uh th like if we are going to include speech recognition  it's kind of between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that. So we could say that was our target. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay  so fifteen to thirty five  look fairly young. You know  they have bit of expendable income to spend on this sort of thing. Yeah. Yeah. So Yeah. Yeah. So they'll not sh not shy away from something quite high-tech. That that's that's a good point. Um okay  so um so shall we make the decision uh to include speech recognition if we can. Okay. Why is that? Okay. Where you can activate it and deactivate it? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Uh-huh. Okay. Uh okay  well do you wanna um give us your presentation and then then we can I don't know um might have been a good idea to all deliver our presentations and then discuss  but this is this is how we're Yeah  exactly  yeah. Oh it's something that's just occurred to me as well is if we make it um speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition  that's appealing to people um maybe with a physical disability as well. Um. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Really? Do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it's worthwhile incorporating it though? Mm. Course not. There you go. Right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Uh. Well  do you wan do you wanna finish up your your whole presentation then? Are you are you all done? Mm. Okay. Okay. Right. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Oh. So this just show how we're kind of modularising the whole thing. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Well well a worry that was was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would e it would effect um how long how long it took us to get this to market  so I th suspect it might be a good idea just to restrict our kind of our creative influence on this on the user interface and not worry so much about uh how we transmit it um because I mean it it's tried and tested intra-red  so we could stay with tha Mm-hmm Oh  yeah. Yeah  mm-hmm. Okay. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Okay. Okay. W Yeah. W Well well we've um In the new requirement spec they said just to focus on the T_V_  so that's what we should do for now I think. Something I was wondering about was the power. Um  is it worth considering like having like a charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries? I mean is that something we really want to go into  do you think  or should we just consider running on regular batteries? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah. Okay. Okay  so Yeah. Yeah. Okay  so just stick to to regular Okay. Um  right. So basically the um I'm just gonna just recap uh what I said at the start  was that um the the whole point of this meeting was to f absolutely finalise who we're gonna aim this at  and what exactly the product's gonna do. So um just to recap on Are we all happy about the idea of um aiming the product at um the fifteen to thirty five bracket? Um and also the funct the the actual functions of what it's gonna do. Do you wanna recap on that  Craig? Okay  right. Okay. Yeah  it's as optional functions. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay  right. Um  okay well I gotta kind of got five minutes to wrap up now. Um next thing we're doing is having lunch. Whoohoo. Um and then we're gonna have thirty minutes of working on the next stage. Um so I'll be putting the minutes of this uh this meeting into the project documents folder. Um so uh I guess just to just to confirm that we know what we're doing in the next well in the thirty minutes after lunch anyway  um for uh our Industrial Designer  you're gonna be thinking about the components concept. Um User Interface Designer gonna be thinking about our user interface  and marketing you're gonna be thinking about trend watching. Um and you'll all get specific instructions as well. So um I dunno  just just to to ask now if you've got anything else you've thought about while we've been talking. Um  do you wanna start with David. Anything else to say at all? No  okay. Andrew? Yeah  yeah I think that's definitely a good idea. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay  so you're gonna have um audio which is gonna be like you know your bass settings and actual volume hi Okay. Okay  and then visual Okay  so brightness  contrast  things like that  and then just actual device things  like what channel you're watching  turning on an off  stuff like that. Okay  um Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Um so yeah  I guess just things to think about are you know like the fact it's gotta look good  because of who we're we're  you know  targeting this at. Um something maybe kind of quirky in design maybe. Make it kind of ergonomic kind of to hold  you know  things like that. Um  so I guess I guess that's it. That's the meeting over. Whoohoo. ,The team members introduced themselves to each other by name and by their roles in the project. The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team and then the team members participated in an exercise in which they drew their favorite animal and discussed why they liked the animal. The project manager discussed the project finances and selling prices. The team then discussed various features to consider in producing the remote such as gaming options  an LCD screen  and combining functionality so as to control multiple devices. 
Hello. Hi. Yeah. It's too beautiful. A minute please  my uh laptop is uh oh  there it is  thank you. So welcome back. At the functional design meeting um the plan is uh that uh each one of you  so not me but only you uh will uh present uh the the things you worked on uh the last uh half hour. I will uh take minutes and will put uh the minutes that I have uh at the end of the session in the shared folder. Also the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now  so you can read that uh now or afterwards. Um uh I had an email from the from the management board uh  I don't know if you a al also uh received it  but there were four points uh which uh I think are very important. First one is uh they think that uh teletext teletext becomes outdated uh and internet will be the the main uh focus. Uh second one is also important uh  because it's one of the discussion points of the previous session. Uh the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television  so it uh not gonna it's not gonna be a multi-purpose remote control  so uh that's one thing to keep in mind. Uh second  and I think that's important for the Marketing uh Expert  uh the current uh customers uh are in the age group group of uh forty years and older  but with this uh new remote uh they uh will uh would like to reach uh a group uh younger than uh forty. Uh and uh I think to keep in mind  but not really uh for now is that they uh want the the the slogan and the and the logo uh to uh to be recognised more in the remote. So  we have uh forty minutes  so I think uh not more than ten minutes uh uh per presentation uh each  and please uh use uh all the the the facilities so that you have either SMARTboards  the the Word files  what you uh whatever you want. So uh Tim  can you start? Yeah? Mm-hmm. But it's strange that the the manage board the management board said that the teletext will be uh outdated by the internet. So that that's strange. Yeah  okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah  okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  that's a cool idea. Yeah. Thank you  Tim. Janus  can you uh Okay  thank you Janus. You do? The last presentation. You have plenty of time  Tim and uh Janus don't uh talk to ten minutes  so uh take your time. If you take your time too long I will uh eventually uh warn you. Uh you you just said um uh you wanted to to combine more functions in one  so uh you you want to keep it simple  but I think that if you want to do that  then you can't escape the the fact that there will be buttons uh which give s uh more options than one. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. So you think it's will be better to have a t kinda total touch screen. Jirun? Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay  yeah. Yeah. Okay. But let's not uh go too wide about the those things  that's that why we're here. It's it's a nice idea  but I think that's we wel later in the stage. I've one little question about um a total touch screen or uh um a p yeah  a partial  uh because I think uh elderly people may be uh not used to uh a touch screen  so they want the the the normal functions like teletext  volume changing  um uh to be uh  yeah  kinda traditionals uh and uh the the the the other functions  the more difficult functions uh to be uh maybe on the touch screen  but to keep this as uh normal as possible  to keep it accessible. Yeah. Yeah  that's true  that's true. Yeah. Yeah  that's true  yeah. Yeah  yeah yeah  yeah  that's a good point. Yep. Mm-hmm. They like the fancy stuff  yeah. That's true. Mm-hmm. Mm Yeah. Okay  as you can see uh the minutes from the second meeting  this one  are uh are done. Uh I've uh added the this uh four things from the management board just to keep in mind. Um each time I uh I had a sort of uh summary on what you told and uh what you personal think. Uh so that can be uh can be read out. Uh a f a few things I uh I noticed uh were um Moment. Ooh. Uh th the the main points in uh this uh uh in this uh meeting is I think uh how uh it's going to look uh with uh we must keep it simple  but have the opportunity to uh have more options and have them uh hidden or something  so they don't uh you don't have a big uh thing full of uh buttons or uh um and uh the point that uh you uh wanna use one uh controller uh for uh uh hypothetically each television  so you must uh the the the the functions  know  like the menus or the the parental control must be all uh by the done by the remote control and not by the television. I think that's the point what uh we discussed. Yeah  but you have uh uh an yeah  but you have an international market range  so you have I think a big range of Yeah. Okay. And it's not too complex to do it. Yeah. Just build it in. Yep. Okay. We have five minutes to go. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. N yeah. It's very sensitive. Yeah. Okay well uh it's almost at the end. So we have now a lunch break  finally  yeah. Uh after the lunch break uh it's back to uh individual work  once again uh thirty minutes. Uh I will put my minutes uh I have updated them so uh s they're updated in the shared folder too. Thirty minutes  the Failure. Uh uh the specifi uh specific instructions for the next uh meeting you will all will receive uh at the uh the the email. I don't think I can uh say much about it  so uh uh wait for your email and uh hopefully you get it done uh in the in the thirty minutes  and I w will see you after the lunch break and the thirty minutes. Yeah? Uh well uh thirty minutes. Uh  yeah. Thirty minutes lunch break  yeah. Oh. Forty five? Uh then would it be uh one o'clock. Or we we ask our personal coach. Okay. Thank you. Thank you  uh that was a very uh good session I think  we uh we Uh ye well Yeah  because uh all uh things are uh stored in smart board dot uh X_D_K_ and that's in No. Well I can I can uh You all uh have the the questionnaire again about uh the after work. Deskt Huh. No. Project documents  yeah. Okay  thank you. Uh well  it's it's simply filling oh no  it's uh it's also filling out no  I'd do it after lunch I think. I'm hungry  so do it after lunch. Thank you all. You're welcome. Yeah. Well I bring it to my uh personal room. My executive uh big room with the with the panting. Hi. Yeah  true. Mm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yes  I can go ahead. Last presentation. Okay. Well  I'm going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and uh usability functions. Um what's my opinion about what's most important to combine the design  technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one  so if you um going to design a remote that looks good  that shouldn't weigh over the uh if it's possible to make  of course  but also the user friendliness  so tha that's that's some of the main points. And another one is um the use um of many functions will will make it more difficult  so use as as little functions as possible or at least don't display them all at once on the same remote. If you have fifty functions you don't want fifty buttons uh t uh to be shown at the same time  'cause when you visit an internet uh site you don't want fifty links uh to see  but maybe use a hierarch hierarchy uh structure. And uh well one of the ideas was maybe uh use touch screen  but s I don't know in how far that is possible  since we are sticking to uh um infrared and and the remote cannot receive anything  but uh we might uh consider that. Um well  of course I I hope this is all clear to you. If you you can use remote like this with all the functions  many functions  but Well  your thumb is a little bigger than th it than this. You have to be very careful what you push  and um if you're looking for teletext you'll be uh searching for half an hour from uh um yeah well  where is it? Where the hell he here I guess and  yeah  when you have to uh use something else. So just keep it simple  make clear buttons  easy to use. For example if you want to use a play and back and stop  that's very important. Um well this was because of our last discussion  if multiple machines are used  create easy switch between the machines  but um it's no longer uh applying. Well yeah  I prefer to use it only for T_V_ and um n uh not to give too many options and and if possible  uh the buttons should give a dr direct action  not first select Yeah  and so that's where the difficulties lie. Yeah  this so that's the thing you have to weigh against each other. Do we want to use a few options and might not be so or original  or uh multi-purpose as we thought  or do we want to use um many buttons. So um weighing those factors. The doesn't. Yeah. Yeah  but when all the questions I had Do we want to use uh a menu display on the T_V_? Or um does have to f everything uh be in remotes? 'Cause if you use a memory display on the T_V_  you can simply push uh a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press okay. Uh so that's my recommendation  if you use many options in one buttle button  um display the menu on the T_V_ and don't um use combination of t of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds  is too complicated for most users. Yeah  that will be a problem. Yes. So if we have to stick with current technologies and uh um well yeah  the restrictions of what's uh is on the market today  um you should keep it s at this. Use big clear buttons. Not too many. So maybe we'll loose a few option uh options  but I think i this is more important. Um especially the important buttons  um if you want to switch channel  change your volume  uh use teletext  it uh it has to work at once and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote  behind uh a little uh little thing or a touch screen. And yeah  if you want to uh uh s put on stand-by or change the channel  that should always be possible to do. Not first change menu options or switch something. Um  well yeah  as you already told  give some feedback. If the user is pushing a button he should know if the television or n at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low. And um  well  my conclusion is uh is uh less is more  keep it simple. So uh maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to uh to keep it accessible on t because you all know  if there are a lot of function on the the television  some you you'll never know uh and never use  and therefore it's uh important if you want to change the volume or channel that is always accessible and easy and other functions um that are not so important um well you we should consider just not using them or at least putting them somewhere on the remote where they're not in the way for the for the most important functions. Maybe that's an option. Um keep the primary buttons visible. Uh make a remote that fits easily in the hands and for some design issues uh well  put a logo on it and maybe use it uh in some aesthetic uh aesthetic form. But uh th the important buttons m make them always accessible and pushable and clear and maybe use a touch screen  or if that's uh will become too difficult just uh like televi some o older telephones use a l uh maybe it's possible to to flip them open and uh just expand the number of options that are normally visible. Um Yeah. The extra functions  you uh you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions  and you just choose one  and then all all the options will become available and you just c s yeah t scroll through them. Well um then I'd like to make a proposal. If you make one big touch screen  use the same concept as here  keep the buttons always available and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest. Yeah. Yes. Okay. Okay  I agree  but I think it's very important that they always um make the same buttons accessible  so use just for special options a part of the touch screen. And so um an elder designer picks up th the of an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who's all in the systems functions  you'll have to have the possibility to turn off the T_V_ or to switch the channel without um well using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah wh Is that possible to use or no? Well  yeah well  does it have to depend on the television? Well  I think that he means that um maybe by some option uh make sure that um remote control and the T_V_ match  and then after that you can um use some s insert some passwords as being apparent that the children cannot use this uh change the settings of the T_V_  like colour and then volume and uh Mm-hmm. Oh  something like that. Well b but make it a separate option in the menu  so that it's it's dif dis displayed from uh displayed here  so uh parents uh Yeah  you can de display it on the on the old style. You can display actual buttons on the touch screens. Yeah  okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yes. Well you can use um when you uh how do you call it  s um synchronized  the um remote and the T_V_  then there's always  there are always uh possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume and um well maybe we can look out if there's options that the remote um in its memory can see what kinda T_V_ it is  from ah  it's a Philips  this and this and that  and then give the options that are capable the capable from the t Well there are universal d um um remotes and they all have a functionality for all the T_V_s  uh so this wouldn't be a extra feature to incorporate the men menus of these. Yeah. Yeah. Well Yeah. Mm-hmm. Oh um mo no  you can just say uh the c Yeah. In codes  y you you get a b a book with codes. You look up  I have a Philips H_ fifty five and it says press code four five five and you press code four five five on the uh in the remote and it displays all your uh menu options. Memory in the in the remote. Yeah  well um if you look at the um manuals from universal uh remotes  there are maybe um three four hundreds T_V_s at maximum. If you have all of them  all the old and new T_V_s summed up  so uh I think uh it is possible. Yeah. Well then you have to buy a new one  it's very good for marketing Maybe  or an update  software update. Firmware update  you say. Yeah. Well  at uh you can go back to the shop and uh they Yeah  ser o and they can download it for you. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well already digital information is sent t to the the standards  T_V_ uh connections  you can see what's uh programme is on on the new uh channels  so maybe j they we can send that information along with standard T_V_ uh Receiving. Oh yeah. Yeah. Difficult. Yeah. Yeah yeah  uh s I think some I think it's good idea  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay  let's uh save this in the meanwhile uh Um m for which one are we going? My mistake. That one or uh Your vote and your Okay. Well  I was uh doubting about which one to take  but uh you've convinced me that uh if you di display buttons about the same as they would look on a normal um remote all elderly people will know what to do. Opens up is too difficult or uh Break it  I don't get Oh so Yeah. Yeah. A quarter to one maybe? Okay. Yeah  is it possible to store this on the share documents or what 'Kay  save it as an image on the res No  and use an image if possible. J_ PEG. J_ PEG. Yeah  it's better Yeah. Oh yeah  it's not connected to the to our P_C_s. It's connected? Yeah. It gives the na Oh. Yes. The questionnaire  fill in uh we fill out d after lunch or uh Okay. Yes. We can leave the P_C_ on I think  yeah and return to the Yeah  bring to I gotta bring it home. A big office. Yes. Hey guys. Too wicked. Okay. 'Kay  welcome. I have some uh new findings on uh Marketing Expert level  which I will show you. The method I used was um giving orders to our usability lab uh to do a questionnaire. Um one hundred respondents were involved and my marketing uh department generated a report with a lot of results. Um  these were a couple of findings  first page of three. Um  we have three audiences of two audiences  I'm sorry. Uh the first one  this scale  from sixteen to forty five age. Uh the second one is from sixty four uh forty six to sixty five. Um  as you can see here  the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent um sixty five. Uh second audience audience is uh thirty five percent. Mm and some interests from the from the age groups  uh it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy uh new technology stuff  like uh an L_C_D_ screen on the remote control  um speech recognition. I don't think that's uh really appropriate. Um  and when you see uh the audience  the age is going up uh Yeah  they don't really want it anymore  at least the new technologies. Second findings out of the questionnaire um are the opinion the opinions uh of the audience about current remote controls. First point is  seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly  uh and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy. So that's maybe something for the User Interface uh Designer. Okay  third findings. According to the frequency of use versus importance investigation  um following buttons are most important. Um  I will tell something about the way this uh this test was  yeah  done. Um  persons were asked uh what the buttons were uh they use most  how much an hour  and uh in the second table the importance of those buttons. Um  when you multiply them  you get the these three points. Switching channels  um yeah  that's pretty uh pretty normal  that's what you do with a remote control. Um the second  teletext  uh and the third  uh volume controls. Um  I think it's good uh that we know what the user want wants  uh at least the these three points have to be uh very clear. Yeah  okay. Yeah  okay  but uh at the moment uh teletext is Yeah  th the best thing you can get uh on T_V_  like getting information. So uh  when you ask people  what do they use  they use teletext and not the internet on a remote control. That's ridiculous. That's a ne i it It's a new technology  but it's not incorporated right now. Okay  my personal preferences. Um  I think we should aim at the uh audience from sixteen to forty five. Mm  first of all um it's the biggest share  the biggest audience  sixty five percent. Uh second  I think you will get the most revenue from i from it. Um  yeah  people from sixteen to forty five watch a lot of T_V_  more than uh people who are el uh elder. Um second point  we have to impro improve the most used functions  as I said here  switching channels  teletext and volume controls. Third point um that came out of the uh of the questionnaire  uh people used to uh get lost off the remote controller  so maybe it's an idea for us uh to design ex kind of placeholder uh on side of the  yeah  of the T_V_ where you can put the the remote control in. Um  that's about it  I think. Yeah. Uh not not the r not the functions  but uh it came out that a lot of buttons weren't even used uh on a remote control. So you can have a remote control full of buttons  a hundreds hundreds of buttons  but if you don't use them  yeah it's Yeah  they have to be on it j just to t to get it done if necessary  but um the most used buttons uh have to be bigger or Yeah  perhaps. Just for the minor functions perhaps. Just to get less buttons on the remote control  to make it easier and quicker to learn. Yeah? 'Kay  that's it. What do you think about uh incorporating Bluetooth or a radio uh receiver uh in the place-holder next to the T_V_  connected to the T_V_? So it's in the wrong product. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um  yeah  maybe another problem uh  I think current T_V_s can even send infrared. Huh. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm it's maybe an option uh if you use an L_C_D_ or a touch screen um  that in the middle are the the main keys  like displayed on the Uh yeah.. Yeah  this? No? Yeah. Something like that. Okay  just uh in the middle the general functions  like play  uh channel switching  and then uh at the top or at the bottom  some menus like uh settings or that you can drop down. Mm. Nah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. I think so too  but and that's partly because um uh a lot of T_V_s have different menus  and when you have a particular menu uh at your device  uh it could be that don't correspond to the menu what's actually on T_V_. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh  I think the idea uh about uh touch screen um is very good. Um  because recently uh I saw news item on T_V_ um about uh new telephones uh for elder people. Um  they have like a touch screen with uh really big pictures on it like uh uh call uh hang-up  um and that's a big ad advantage I think  because one the one hand uh you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by uh scaling up the pictures or something. It's uh very visual intended. What was I to say more? Yeah. Yeah okay  but but if you pick the the idea  the left idea then what's gonna be displayed on the touch screen? Yeah  but l like menu functions or Ah okay. Yeah  I think so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  I think so. Yeah  of course. Yeah  I had another uh idea about maybe parental control. Um  like building in uh some kind of PIN code uh which allows uh parents to switch to all channels  uh but children uh if children don't don't know the PIN code  they can't switch to uh violent uh channels or Th there's just Ju just a simple log-in  something like that. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah  okay. Yeah. Yeah  th that kind of stuff  but maybe um if you log in first as a parent um  you address the the channels and like uh oh  that's channel fifteen  that's uh vi violent channel  uh m my ki my kids uh I don't want my kids to watch that  then you set the priority to only parents  for example. But Yeah okay  but but yeah  that's just that's an a an added feature. Yeah  th th those things are nice. Partial. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah  but but if you display it on L_C_D_ screen with r r really big numbers that's just as e just as easy. Yeah. Yeah  it's different. Yeah  age b below forty. And th those young people  yeah. Y you saw it in my marketing report  they like the new fancy stuff  so A touch screen  like Microsoft al already developed something like that for uh uh multi-media applications. I th I think we can do that too. Done. Yeah  yeah  some of them. The menus uh are not identical for all th for all T_V_s  so you have to display it on one uh T_V_. Yeah  but that's not possible. Mm-hmm  mm yeah. Add th that that's an opportunity. Yeah. But No. No no no. He he he he me he means just just one other thing. Uh  with the current remote controls  the universal ones  um you have to press yeah  you have to press a code for T_V_. Yeah. Yeah. Now we uh just connect uh the T_V_ type uh to a set of options  in just just in the memory  so that if you yeah  like profile  so that if you uh touch in like uh one four one zero kind of T_V_ uh the memory uh pops up the options. I th don't think that's uh that takes a lot of storage space or some just varia variables. Mm-hmm. Yeah. But  on the other hand on the other hand  uh if you have a remote and buy a new T_V_ that isn't incorporated in the remote New remote? A firmware upgrade or something  but from where? Ah. Maybe w No m may no  maybe we can incorporate some kind of uh U_S_B_ or a firewire connection  so that you can uh connect it to the P_C_ and download the newest firmware from uh from the internet. Yeah  like a s kind of service centre. Yeah. Yeah. I I think it's uh most cheap or cheapest to just do the updates uh at the service centre or at the shop. It's it's it's not a lot of work  just one uh docking station where you put it in  press start  bling bling  updated. Yeah. You don't buy a T_V_ every week  new teev so. Let's vote. My vote too. And your vote? Yeah. And also like a clapping uh li like device that uh pops open. Uh too difficult  um maybe uh it's easier to break it. Yeah  th th th that i uh Yeah. Like my telephone  it's uh it's sensitive too. Ah. Thirty minutes? How minutes? One question  uh how late do we have to get back be back here? Thirty minutes lunch break? I thought forty five. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah  me too. Save as. Yeah  v But but you can open a from your pr from your laptop. Yeah  maybe. Save as. No. Export. Export H_T_M_L_. Huh  image? Paper size A_ four. Uh screen size. In this directory. No? Yeah  it is connected. Yeah  I think so. Oh. Thank you. Yeah  of course. To my exave executive Aye. Yeah. Okay. Hi. I see my bunny is still standing. No one drawing it. Uh I figured uh that much. When you mentioned uh improving functions  what uh what do you mean by that what what are you think about? Uh  the funtionability. Ah okay  so focusing more on the used buttons. Yeah. Could you use perhaps uh one button for multiple functions  like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function for example. Thank you. Yeah  ma perhaps  just just an idea. Yeah. Uh yeah yeah  I'll go  sure. Right uh  I'll be uh explaining a bit about uh working design about uh the project. Well uh what I did was I dissected uh uh current remote controls and um I viewed how how they w looked  how they worked  uh what kind of components are involved  and how they are connected together. And uh after that I put up a scheme about how uh these things are organised and I'll show it to you in in a in a few seconds. And I'll explain a bit about uh how it works and how we could uh build one and why I think several possibilities uh that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off. Um right. Uh well what I did was uh I I checked uh remote controls and the uh remote controls of today are all infrared  not like all probably know. And the thing about that is um the remote controls uh have to act as a T_V_ or uh a stereo or something  and those uh have a transmitter that's also focused on infrared  so if we want to uh build uh mm a remote control uh with Bluetooth for instance then uh the T_V_ should have Bluetooth too in order to communicate  so that would mean extra cost for the user and thus uh that's that wouldn't mean a a cheap uh remote control for us. So that's probably why most controls are still infrared. Furthermore they all have uh a a very simple structure  so that would probably uh mean lower costs and uh i that could mean for us a good thing uh 'cause uh well we we should be able to build a relatively cheap uh a cheap uh remote. Well uh as I mentioned ready  we have some Bluetooth Well it may be possible  but uh I figured it wouldn't be possible in within our budget  but that's not for me to decide  but that's maybe something for marketing to look into. F because uh well my personal opinion is uh is not to do uh Bluetooth or or radio waves  although Yeah  actually I have t Yeah. Yeah  I actually I figured that would be that would be rather nice  but then you'd still have the uh the infrared function. So in in theory you'd actually just move the problem  but uh what I did uh think about was when you mentioned about the uh the cup-holder  is why not uh introduce a speech function like where is the remote. If somebody says  where is the remote  then it goes uh beep uh beep beep beep or something  I dunno  maybe uh maybe something to look into  I dunno uh what the cost that something like that would be. But it may be uh may be something to explore. Uh I'll I'll just explain a bit of the components. Uh first you have the energy source. The energy source would be a battery  simple uh battery uh that you can find anywhere. I figured that would be best  'cause when the battery uh stops functioning uh we could just uh use you could just go out and buy a new one. So we didn't and we don't have to do all uh to be too complicated about that. Uh the energy source is connected to the infrared button  but uh the infrared button uh works only via the chip and the subcomponent to uh the switch there is a switch uh between these. When the switch is pressed in a w on this this case it switches a button  when a button is prush pushed in  uh a electric current goes through here  and in uh immediately  a l a bulb lights up uh displaying to the user that something has happened. That's uh that's so the h user won't be um thinking  well uh did the button be pressed  w what happened uh. Or I press button but nothing's happening on the T_V_  so is is something wrong or something. So that's just to uh to to explain the of to to uh make it clearer to the user. Uh w well the signal goes via chip that's translated into uh electric sig uh electronic signals and then it's processed and then it's sent to the infrared bulb where it will be uh uh received on the receiving end. And those uh interpreted by the device  well in this case the television. Uh well my personal preferences here  well we have to keep it simple. Not too many uh gadgets and functions  just like you said uh well the most users n uh you have a lot of buttons and you u u use you don't use them  so why why should we invent uh w spend more time on those. Uh I I think we should stick by with infrared transmitting and uh no receiving. So uh no input from the television. So I think we shouldn't be uh spending time on um teletext and st things like that  because when you uh want teletext on uh infrared you'd have to build in a receiver too  and so in order to receive the signals from uh what's on T_V_ and such. So I figure that would be uh spending too much money and time and Yes  but what should we uh s I I I f I agree with you  but should we spend money or and time on building a receiver into the uh remote control? 'Cause that would be I mean extra components  extra designs  um larger g uh remote control. These all uh all stuff that we have to take in account. So I I my personal opinion is no no no receiver at all. Um  well we should uh look into the design and the functionability. Like I said  uh use one button for instance for m multiple functions  or well uh just hide the few buttons o of switching it open or something  the usual uh stuff. And uh don't overbuild  we shouldn't make a big uh remote control for simple functions  but we we should stick to the basics. So that was my uh my personal opinion. And that was my uh my presentation uh Yeah  but Yeah. Yeah  but Yeah  but Well you d you have to keep in mind that uh several T_V_s uh don't even have a menu structure  or they have a very simple menu structure  so you have to keep in mind that not all uh d not our remote won't be able to work on all televisions. And that would be uh a considerable problem. Yeah. Not embed Yeah  but then with something like a touch screen could could make more menu up pop up or something. Yeah. Yeah. The extra functions. Yeah. Wouldn't it be better to make just one big touch screen  uh one one small uh touch screen uh applet and uh I'll just make um uh let's say fifteen buttons on it  and uh we have three of those  uh actually just uh menus with sub-menus  with or sub-items  sub-functions. Yes. Yeah. Yeah  yeah  like like the iPod idea that that we just saw. You just have a f a few selected buttons and uh a few menus  and with this idea you could actually make uh several you can also improve uh later on. Uh uh I think that will be great. Yeah  I wou I would actually go for the Yeah. That is possible  that well that actually depends on the television  but I think I figure that would be Well  y you s you see the fi uh thing is when you buy a remote  you you set the uh channels  the the channels are different on each te television  they aren't set in a preset order  so uh if you uh lock on a remote  uh let's say channel fifteen  well channel fifteen on this television is different than channel fifteen on the other television  so that would be uh that would be actually the main concern. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  that would b Yeah  that. Uh. I I do Uh I do agree  because well  it's just not the same when you touch a touch screen or when you touch a button  but well we have to look at what's our target uh audience. W we are aiming for younger people and they they chose So that's that's probably uh a But they Well they uh they all have to be programmed to fit your T_V_ and that that is bit of a tricky job. I actually use one of those when They are they are kinda kinda troublesome  but but the thing is whe when you uh start uh building something like this you have to build a receiver into the uh t into the remotes  because uh in order for the remote to process something from the T_V_  like uh to synchronise and you have to send and receive  and that's well Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Oh  okay  yeah  sure  uh Yeah yeah yeah. Oh  yeah yeah  sure  that would be possible  yeah. Profiles. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  that would be possible. Yeah  sure. No  that wouldn't be uh Yeah  a few variables. Yeah. Ah it is. It is definitely po Yeah  firmware upgrade. That's maybe the cup holder. Yeah. Well  not everybody has uh has uh a P_C_ at home. Well the most most people have  but not not everybody and Yeah. Yeah  maybe something like service cen Or you could well you could s actually look at the place-holder you talked about earlier  and you could probably uh make a connection to uh an telephone line or a internet connection. Yeah. Well then then it's be uh back to the building a receiving uh well uh if it's actually worth it to build it in  we could actually look at into it  but I dunno  it it would be uh bringing more costs uh with with it and Yeah  that would be probably best  yeah. Like when you when you buy a T_V_ you just ask well I'll Yeah. Yeah  that would be best  yeah. No no. Exactly  so Yeah  my vote goes out to the right. Flips open. Export. Maybe not export function. G_ yeah  J_ PEG. N oh. To room. I'll just uh saved in my documents. Yeah in my own uh in my own messenger. Yeah. Okay  nice. Aye  cheers. ,The User Interface Designer discussed  some characteristics and functions to consider in designing the remote and introduced an idea for giving the remote international appeal by merging it with a system such as Google. The Industrial Designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and presented options for components and materials which would keep costs low. The Marketing Expert presented consumer preferences and requirements. The project manager introduced the new requirements for the project. The team then discussed different features they could include in the design of the remote. 
That's new one? Yep. Yep. Big microphone. Oh okay. That's the place where it's going to be  not the size. Mm-hmm. Yeah  okay. Of course. Mm. Mm  th yeah. Small. Shit. 'Kay. Evaluation. 'Kay  my task was this time to put up a questionnaire by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we requirements from the of the users. My name  my job  okay. The methods. Questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven  from true to false  like question  is remote big enough  we can say it's true or it's false by steps. One means absolutely not true  seven means true. The three important things of refa are uh from th of this year is are  is the remote control fancy enough  is it in innovative enough  and is it easy enough to use. And then evaluation itself. Uh. So. Okay. First question. Is the design fancy enough? Project Manager  what do you think? But does it Yeah. Think. Yeah  yeah  you can. Isn't going to be a little bit heavy at the top? With two batteries  the whole print plate and t and top  and if you're holding it quite a lot I think Yeah. Yeah  we have to rate. Is it fancy enough? True is one  false is seven. So fancy enough means  does it comes to the younger people and the elder people. I think Yeah  I have to agree  all the colour colours don don doesn't matter that m that much now  it's only design. And the design. So A two? Yeah  I n used I wouldn I should use that one  but it doesn't Okay  no it's two? True is a one. Very true  is it very true or isn't that true? Yeah  I think two. That's fancy enough. Then? Okay. Let's give it a two. Is it innovative? Enough. We have for the search function. The scroller a bit I think it's it's a one yeah. True. Also huh uh-huh the buttons  are they easy to find? That was a big requirement of the old people. Are all the buttons easy to find? Not only this buttons  all the buttons. I think th it's easy t Yeah  I think this is easy now. I think th I think the options buttons are not the the easiest way to to to handle. True. I would rate it a Yeah  okay  that's true  that's true. But that's that's vantage of L_C_D_ screen  you can have text. Yeah. I think it's a three. I personally think  because I d I don't think i maybe it's easy to use  it has to be easy to find right away. I I think if you have the button at the right  I don't think you can find the option button that easy. You can touch it. Yeah  okay  but you have y then you have here s written option on here  the teletext button  right? Okay  then okay  good. Then I think also two  yeah. Yep. It's easy to use  as well for younger as elderl elderly people. Young means sixteen to forty years. And elderly from forty eight to their death. Also if you're sixty years old Also Yeah  as well as your if you're fif sixty years old  you're holding one of those things in your hand No  but we're going to th make this f for a all kind of people  so it it it has to be If you read the manual  always. So Also two? Not a seven for this? I would also say three. Remotes overwhelmed with buttons. No  that that's that's yeah. Tha that's a one  I think  that's definitely a one. No? Oh yeah. Yeah  I think isn't  this has to be something like isn't overwhelmed. True. Remote control has uh colours that different that meet different target groups. Yeah. That's true. Also with rubber? Yeah  okay. Yeah? That's a one? Okay. Uh I have The material used is spongy  that that's uh that's a one  that's m rubber. Yeah  I th think it's not the most spongy thing. Yeah. Remote control is hard to lose. Y you can't you can't lose it if you're sixty years old. If first time see the thing you didn didn't adjust uh set the microphone  and then you lose it  then you have lost it. It isn't hard  no. I think I think this is a two  personally. No. Isn't hard to lose. Yeah. You can't lose it. Or if you're you're sixty years old  your demands I think yeah  I think also. Huh? Yeah? Oh  okay. No. Okay okay okay. Remote control mainly be sold to younger people. Yeah? True? Very true? No  I don't think very true because the colours. We have the colours. Um we have the buttons is aren't that that much. Nah  the material isn't that So I don I think I think it's a three. Yeah  but I uh Okay  okay. I think because yeah? In the features? Because younger peoples are cr critical and they wanted a lot of features on this thing. L_C_D_ screen and scroll. I I think they'll be quite met with their expectations. No. It's three features  basically  the L_C_D_ touch screen is feature. The microphone is a feature. Yeah  okay. I think yeah  and then you have the audio settings  channel setting  video settings. Yeah yeah. So I've chos I shou I think it's it's it's a one. Personally  yeah. I think once you've 'cause you have the channel features b uh you have the uh screen features  audio features  the you have all buttons on it which you'd like  microphone extra  L_C_D_ screen extra  scroll thing extra. Make it make it a two. Or make it uh a fucking two. You can see the remote control is R_ and R_. Has oh yeah  do did have nah y you have the black one. And we'll probably make also a yellow one. Maybe two. X_ marks spot. And the menu is avail that is available is easy to use. Yeah  tha that's so true. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah  uh I think that wou that would be quite hard to learn to use it. No  I'm not not convinc. Let's go th for I think it would be a t yeah  two. Now lower. So okay  we have one three  a one  that that have to got up. Two two two two two. So two  yeah. The average is a two. That is quite good in my opinion. That Ooh. Ooh. Top. Okay. Yes. No  it's two. The average is two. Yeah  I uh uh I uh saved it. f fifty five Euros. No. Yeah mm yeah  maybe. The microphone. Yeah? maybe you're going scrap scrap it. No prob. Ah. Count it? Li like write it be Ah  okay  cool. Huh? Yeah? Oh  yea yeah  you design it. Um Yeah. Solar cell. No it took a battery? Yeah. We have No  we have sample speaker. But b al but we also have sample speaker  do Oh  we already on nine. We have double curved. Single. This one is This one is curved like this  right. It's curved like this. Yeah  bu what Oh  but we have curves like it and it. There are two curves  right? Oh  okay I understand  I understand. Rubber. Push button. No  we don't have push button. L_C_D_ display. Eighteen and a half  damn. We have to lower it with six points. Twelve and half. We could use I think we should scrap the sample speaker. It's four pri it four units. But w d wha Curved then it will be square. Was that does that mean to it  single curve? Okay. Yeah  but tha that that only is one. No  one. So we don't Yeah  we also have to No  otherwise we don't have an L_C_D_ screen. Single curved. Flat. Yeah  so that does doesn't doesn't that mu I think Scrap sample speaker? That that's uh Yes  four points. Yeah  but what what else what else uh do you want to scrap? F You have to we have to scrap four points. Ma make it with wood instead of rubber? Yeah  it it i Yeah  it also uh it also takes one point less. Yeah. I think it is. Yeah. Yeah. Sample speaker. Yeah  okay  three. Point three. Huh? Point twelve. That's a scroll wheel. Yeah  but a wood we can make it brown  dark brown  not wood. Is it also no that that's just normal colour fruit colours. Normal colours  yellow Yeah  but then I d I don't think we can ever make to a twelve and half. But then we have to scrap L_C_D_ display  we have to scrap uh s advanced chip. No then we have to scrap everything we got because how many colours we gonna make? Five? Then we have two. S touch. Then we can make add two colours on it. Yeah  two colours it. They can add two colours. But the colours. Um how ma uh the colours like l she told  is that all the colours we add or Yeah  but we we we are we have yellow  red  uh black  titanium. Ah okay. Yeah  but the rubbers alls original black. Yeah b Yeah  but we're gonna make it yellow uh red  and then you add you have two special colours on top of the one we have now. Yeah  but m Yeah  because we have more colours than only black. I then I think I p I don I don't think they me mean they're special Yeah  okay okay  true. True  true. We have two points spare. Nee one point. Mm yep. Y yea the scroll wheel is dropped. Yep. Tap. It should've work. Yep. just tap somewhere. No? Evaluation drops. And erase the mic. Looks like a iPod. Oh. All I need is mic. Station page. I think we it should be b it would be better if we worked a little bit together. Now we worked through each other  something he said yeah  and you had information I also had  so some some things I had in my presentation  they already told  so So yeah  that I don't think that is the best way to work at for such project. Yeah  no  or maybe session of five minutes together or something  and then work separate. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah m yeah  like she told. Then you can work together too by mail or by  I dunno  chat  something  but now we're completely separated from each other. I don't think that was the best way  but Yeah  the technology's okay. Yeah okay  but I don I do I think becau that's because Yeah. Yeah  like the f like a plotters or something  yeah. Yep yep yep yep yep. Yeah  it is useful  but No. Yep. I didn't use it at all. I didn't use. No yeah. It is it is yeah  it is easy for to design something and then load it in your computer. Yeah. Yeah. It's b bi little bit too big to write. Yeah. Fat document  those. Team work was okay. Only thing that we worked through  past each other. With some things that was only problem  but Yeah yeah yeah  but furthermore better. That's yeah  no prob. Ah. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Little bit uh lo yeah. Too late it it it took a lot of time before you got your ema yeah. I played I think seven times Solitaire something. Wha Oh right  it is there. No  I I never got that. I always N yeah. So does this I think lik oh and information was a bit low I think  sometimes  in in in in the beginning I didn't understand what what to do. Yeah  like I with with the remote and I never new we have t we had to uh yeah made a made a rec a remote control. Yeah  so So  yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Faster. Yeah. Yeah  it only costs four units. Uh yeah. Um Yeah. Nothing. I think we got it already. Yeah. And furthermore the the the network was okay. Everything you loaded was also av available there. So Yeah. Yeah  but that It's now half past four half past three  so Yeah  okay. Yeah  okay. Mm-hm. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. No prob. Mm-hmm. I think you do. Can you find it as a J_ PEG? No. In uh Celebra Or shouldn't I? Six hundred. No  I yeah. I think eight hundred six hundred is better. Yeah. Nah  name. Hey. Oh my God. Ten. Yeah. Ten. Uh. Celebration time  come on. Peace out nigger. Entree Beep. Oh. Uh  we should save that one. Yeah  save in the folder. Save as project. Oh  okay. Hmm hmm. Agenda. Oh  sorry. Okay. Get up stand up. just 'Kay. View. Just example colour  so uh there's one of the colours we would like to uh see in our prototype. Okay? yeah  just uh just an idea about how to m th that could also be possible. Uh well  it's an idea in a so. Do not forget it. To function it it doesn't really have to be sm uh big of course. The microphone could be just a minor uh hole uh on the left uh button. Okay um we also made some uh ideas about how uh the options menu would work. Uh using the scroll button on sides uh y uh I uh um Yeah  you push the scroll button and a drop down menu or a pull out menu comes out and uh you get uh you get the options uh becoming available. For example uh T_V_ settings  uh remote settings  et cetera. So uh you can scroll down too with the scroll uh button  uh as you can see oh  it's here  just push it in  uh the menu comes out like this and uh i it all becomes visible. Um Yeah  that's c Yeah. Indeed. Okay  um it's also uh nice to see that um we made a small uh menu  uh the options menu uh becoming available when pressing the uh scroll uh button  and the opportunity to use the teletext  whi which is used uh which should still be used and we think that it's uh very handy to put it uh not uh under the options menu  but in uh Yes. In an apart uh In a separate button  yeah. A sign  yeah  just like Okay  indeed. Okay  we can uh modify that later. Okay. Would you like to make any comments about next uh Previous page  yeah  indeed. Oh my God. It's quite large. Okay. You can see very clearly now that the uh teletext and options menu isn't uh taking uh much uh uh it's taking much part of the screen  so it's very uh when you uh when you use it  doesn't uh become irritating to see. 'Cause if you put it on the top you always get see the the options menu. 'Cause people regularly uh read from left top to right down  so Okay. Huh. Full screen. Alright. Huh. My name  my job. Sorry  you used the PowerPoint What? Bling. Now uh the single curved idea was uh Yeah  okay  you ge um Yeah. The sideways view  uh that that that ma Ho not that pen. Not that pen. Suppose so. Ah. Oh my God  it works. Yeah  that's the single curve indeed. Yep. That's not very i it's also uh very handy if you make a side curve way to make the the remote control very thin at the bottom uh at a bottom at a bottom. Uh make it uh rather thick on the top  because uh on the top it has uh the screen  which takes uh in some uh space  and the batteries can be located over there  so uh Yeah. No. Yeah. Okay  indeed. Yeah. I think so. It's pretty fancy. you get th Yeah. It's true  it's a one. Very fancy. It's very true  because we designed it to be very fancy  so It's very fancy  I think. Have you ever seen a remote control like this? No  okay  so so it's fancy. Yeah. And uh uh the scroll is rubber  so s Eno enough to I think. Huh. With the ones Yeah. Take a harder look  yeah  sure. It's easier than the regular uh remote control. Yeah. Yeah  they are a lot easier to find than uh th than on the regular remote controls where you have to uh find out what which sign or icon means on uh every button. So you have t you have to use the the the manual to understand most Yeah. I think it's uh it's a two  at least. It's not perfect  but A three? And why is that? It said bo both the options. Yeah. A two  a two. Uh the next question the next question. Oh my God. Yeah  I was uh Yeah. I think it's the most useful uh remote control ever to be manufactured. Yeah  but because it has the regular uh controls  li uh as you can see in the screen now  and uh you don't have all the other options uh always uh on your screen. So it's t I think it's really easy to use. You want these options to Uh sure. Perhaps that is one of the most uh Uh because a lot of Channel one  channel four  yeah. Yeah  I think it does. Because all the people who can't uh Uh a two. Sure  two. Oh. Two. Give me more. No. That's definitely our uh A false  yeah. Yeah  indeed. Yeah  is optional. Huh. Yeah. Yeah  it is it is harder to to like Geez. We're getting paid. We're getting paid. Uh. Yeah  it's a three  because you want to make it uh rather flexible but not too flexible  because it has a L_C_D_ screen. Hard to lose  yeah it sh and it's easy to find. Isn't hard to lose. Isn't hard to lose  yeah. Yeah  this this is hard to lose. This Two  yeah. And most all because of the option to Whoa. Uh. put the cor cursor on the. Click. True. True. Uh yeah. Uh Materials  yeah. Uh okay. So ma uh make it make it a two. A two? I think it's two. I think it's two too  two too too. Well perhaps not. Well  n not exactly but uh uh if it had some games on it or something like that  but it's for a remote control I think it i it would satisfy those needs. Yeah  the speech possibility  the colours. Scroll options  yeah. Yeah. The easy volume up button. Remote younger people usually use the remote control to put on the volume. Turn uh turn up the volume. Two. One two three. Right. Uh. Okay  true  yeah. I think it's easier to use than a regular remote control  because when you push on the options menu  you get the the the various options uh entirely explained. Entirely explained. Instead of uh just finding out what an icon means on a button. Yeah  you can navigate. Uh. You're not satisfied  okay. Let's start over again then. A two. Oh yeah  I think so. Yeah. And three. The average. Yeah  I think so. Save. It's a fly. Oh m Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. It i It wasn't too much. As well as the L_C_D_ screen. Whoa. Count it. You got Excel to count. Oh okay. Well I dra uh Danny  Danny  I'll do that  because I draw the uh No  no solar cell  no no no no. No hand dynamo. Hand On advanced chip. Yeah  yeah. Single nee single curved. Double curved was uh uh see uh ju three dimensional. But it isn't three dimensional  it isn't curved in a l No no no  single curved is like this. Uh that's the only curve you made  not th uh curved like that. That's uh Huh? Yeah. Yeah  we gotta integrate scroll wheel and push button  because when you push it and you w it won't just pu uh makes possible to s Not going to work? Okay. Okay um But now button supplements. We don't got the button supplements. Damn. Okay. Nah. We could lose the scroll wheel. You could make it just a regular scroll wheel. Yeah  if you can't push it you have to tap the the options window uh button here and then uh scroll down with the d with uh with uh the button. Normal scroll wheel. Lose Okay  so we don't exactly need the single We don't need a curve. 'S possible to lose curve. Okay. Yeah  that's meant with scr uh with s curve. The curve is uh in a dimension. If you make it a flat one  s n it's no curve  you got no curves. Yeah  okay. No  two. Oh  okay  indeed. Is it possible to make No. The sample speaker is two d wait  f s four points. Yeah  uh becau uh when you lose the Yeah. No  that's no. Make it w uh when you made it uh uh uh a remote control of wood? You don't make a remote control of Ah. It isn't. What? To knock the sample speaker  yeah. And sample sensor. But m yeah  course  but What we'll have. Let's make it thirteen or fourteen. A colour. Yeah  special colours  fruity colours. Yeah. Yeah. They don't sell green rubber plants. Alright. No no no. If we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally uh depending uh dependent on uh the touch screen then it's possible to make. And then you can and then you can add to the colours. Special c Okay  if you lose uh if you lose the You lose this one  you got eleven point five and you make i and then you can make uh the spec single curve  for example. How d uh uh how many colours? Special colours  all the colours you want  because you want to make p Yeah  but uh when you use more than one colour  it's a special colour. I suppose. Yeah. Nee we we also want to make ano another colour. Yeah  indeed  yeah. You don't need four of those uh four of those special colours in one in one remote. Hmm. Yeah  single curve. Uh. Huh. Okay. Undo  undo. Undo. So  'kay. Twenty minutes? Okay  so you had this list at start? Alright. When did you receive this list? Ah okay. Ah okay. I suppose this is a Okay  so we lose the scroll wheel  the s And the microphone. Okay. Strange. You can only re erase? Oh. Uh  no. Bling. Ah. just up somewhere b uh besides it  right. Uh  we already try. All I need is no mic. Bon chance No  add Yeah. S Difference between lines and text and the pen. Huh  looks fucking boring now. Deadlines were sometimes very short. But And stressful. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  but but why not work here together  for example? Why should we be separated from each other in those difference uh different rooms? Yeah. Huh  oh right. But the technology was uh fantastic. Work now? Perhaps it is e Yeah  perhaps it is easier to get one of those uh dig digital pens or so and to uh and lay it next to that keyboard over there. So you can draw uh see it over th on the screen. Yeah. It's useful  but not m Because when you put this pen on the screen uh uh for exam and line is d being drawn at at two or three centimetres uh below. Alright. The project uh because of the deadlines you didn't had the time to uh have  you didn't have time to uh to make a very uh qualitati qualitative uh presentation. So you used uh this uh the different PowerPoint presentations uh in which you put your uh material in the Oh. Wasn't me. But I didn't I uh I used it too  but oh well. Yeah. Yeah  because it shou To make some designs  it is very easy. Yeah. But to write it th yeah. Yeah  it's too big  it's too fat. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Not too much  not too too too too. Yeah  or the room for it was the idea to be creative  so You got some standard ideas in your head and this what came out. Yeah. The information uh was sometimes uh a little bit too late or Yeah. Was searching and searching. No  w I didn't know Make a r yeah. Yeah. No stepping on the table and then looking at the internet page. No. Yeah  more information about the costs. First of all I didn't think uh that we were able to make an L_C_D_ screen uh first point  but uh it was possible uh uh  yeah. Yeah. Uh. Faster laptop. Uh. They were they were just fine. Uh. Right. Yeah. Mm. Yeah  sure. Oh thank you. Bling. You're fired. Mm. You cannot you can save it. You s uh file save as the J_ PEG J_ PEG. No. No. Okay. In about five minutes. Ah. Oh thank you. Whoo-hoo. Let's let's have party. Let's have some fun. Huh? No that uh is one thousand twenty four. Yeah. If it browse. Desktop. Mm? I do not know. Oh? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Alright. Oh. Oh. What? Yeah. Yeah. We didn't make any uh Oh in Didn't we just do that? Oh. Hmm? We could. Oops. Yeah. Well uh we made a prototype. We first start with the overall uh This is about the total remote control. We made it green. Yeah. It's a fresh colour. And uh the screen light blue. Oh uh this the scroll button and the microphone on the on the sides here under. And the R_ and R_ logo  it just says R_ and R_ now  but uh Any questions so far? Yeah. Yeah. Oh y you perhaps you should make it a bit big  so people know it's there and uh Uh Hmm. You push the scroll button and it's claps out if there's a Remote settings  et cetera. Yeah. Yeah. And you could also touch it so that it comes out  and and use the the the scroll thing as a with your fingers. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Perhaps we should use the teletext sign in p yeah. Yeah. Forgot. Uh well  this is the total interface uh that f of the L_C_D_ screen. Uh the numbers  which is pretty straight forward. We put ano an an extra button in. We can erase it  but It's the button where you can switch channels. just when you are one and you go to two  you can or if you go to five  you can go back to one with that button. Yeah  that one  yeah. It has a name. And uh uh we put that in  I thought it would be handy there. Uh this the one number or two numbers button. Below that  the page and the sound. And uh in the middle the the mute. Uh battery indicator. It's it's a bit big. And this is the uh the on off uh knop  the stand by uh knop. Or at least it should look like it. And the options uh of teletext. Huh. Yeah. Well this about it  I think. Yeah. I will put it back on the on the nice green. That's the logo of the Yeah. It's th th right now it's only R_ R_  but uh Yeah. Sorry. Oh full screen  yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well Yeah. It uh oh it's in the background. Oh. Y you should make uh a sideways uh view. It will be  I guess. Oh  we can Oh g I would smart board. Uh can I draw here or uh Ooh. So it would be uh something like this from the side  but with a bit of uh curve here  right? Yeah. So if you v flip it like this. Here's yeah. Yeah. So you just make the back of this part a bit bigger  so that it lays a bit o Yeah  that's a bit of problem maybe. Yeah. I think yeah  the battery should be in here  because it's just nothing  so if you could Yeah. 'Cause otherwise I think i I think it does. I if you don't make it green  then the elder people won't won't like it. Yeah. I think it does. Yeah. I don't know whether older people will use it  but I would make it a two or something. Yeah. Huh? Alright  it's a one. Oh it's a one. Yeah. But it's a one uh Maybe uh Yeah. Well they think it's very true  but uh Yeah  but We should perhaps That not. Yeah. I think it is  because it has an L_C_D_ screen  a mi microphone. It's from rubber. Yeah. It's a one I think. Yeah  because they're right on your screen. So you can use the b the the arrows. They're right on your screen  so I don't know where you'd search. Yeah. Well  I think they are. The options are it uh little bit harder  but if you touch the options then it's uh No they're not  but they're they're they are easy to find. Oh. Yeah. I would say yeah. Yeah. Yeah  you can make it a two. Yeah  but you don't have t have to use the button on the right. You can touch it. Yeah. You you can touch options. Yeah. You can touch options and it's comes out. The uh the um Below. It's different. For young people I think it's easy to use. Yeah. I think it's In the entire mankind. Yeah. Yeah  but uh Yeah  but they they don't want the uh extra options  right? So Yeah  okay  but so they could Uh I think it is. If they read a manual. Yeah  alright. Because it it's not it's not it's it's not uh difficult. You say you say uh record to to the to the speech recognition  then you say the question and the answer. And that's everything it does  the speech recognition. Yeah. I think it would make it uh I would make it two. Yeah. Three? Oh. You? Oh. Well Two and a half. Three? No. No. But um I mean  that's definitely one. Oh nee  oh seven is it? It is. Yeah  uh the remote score. It's not overwhelmed. Yeah. Yep. Yes. 'Cause we make them in different colours  so that they uh Yeah. That it that it looks like wood  like something  yeah. Uh I think you can. It it feels like rubber  but Well but then when you scratch it it does come off. So that's a bit Oh we have time. What? Yeah  yeah  it's very spongy. Oh but not it's not very spongy  because it's hard rubber. I think it's a three. Hard but Yeah. You can break it. Yeah. Y yeah  you could you could call it. Yeah  y you can lose it  but it isn't hard to lose. Two. That it's hard to lose? Yeah  it it is there's the it's a six  you think? So it's a two. Yeah  you can lose it  so I don't you can make it a three I It does have an a built in function. Nee. Hard to lose. Oh right. It is hard to lose. Yeah  so then this is it is almost true  so a two. Ooh. Oh. Oh well  it doesn't. I think it will  yeah. Uh well I a a two. It's it's much more younger. Yeah. I think it's a two but Two two two. Let's make everything a two. Younger people. It has What did Yeah. Well that it doesn't. Yeah bu but I think they like the speech. You could call to your uh yeah  and the screen  yeah. Right  that that that those are features. No  aren't the features the microphone's feature and that you can change the channel's feature  and that you can change the volume is feature  and that you can change the options of the remote  uh uh something like that. Yeah. Those are features. Enough features? Yeah. I think two or three. Yeah. Yeah uh a two a two. Just another two. We like two. Yeah  there's R_ and R_ in front. Uh it's not the colour  so maybe you should make two  but it has R_ and R_. Yeah. Yeah  but not R_ and R_ yellow I think. One d on i it's the colours and the I think it is  but I don't know what you think. And you can navigate easier  because wi with the you have to push the the the arrows and with a normal T_V_ uh remote. Yeah. Let's make a different remote. Well Menu. A two? We only have twos. Uh just twos. One three and a few ones. Two threes. We m mostly have twos  so it's pretty good. Yeah. Yeah. I think so too. We can be happy. Yeah. What is it? It's like a bug or something. A fly  yeah. A f butterfly. Yeah. That's it. Sure. It's good. Yeah. Yeah. Redesign. No. Yeah. Yeah. So we're going to erase features or something. Do you have the cost or uh Let's hope. We're going to be here at eight o'clock. We're goin still going to be here at eight o'clock. I doubt it. Perhaps we've got features that don't exist in the Excel sheet. No  it was in my uh my information  so uh Yeah. Well  if it doesn't work I want to fill it in  but uh But you should uh direct The number of We've got a battery  one or t two batteries  or not? nee one battery  with two small batteries. Yeah. I would do a battery we do. Right? A battery. One battery  right? Electronics  simple chip advanced chip  right? Yeah  so this one and this one. Uh we ha we have um single what? Are we? Oh yay. The single. Oh the the it's not going to work uh people. We have rubber. Thirteen? With a scroll wheel  right? Is he integrated? No  eh? I don't know. Oh yeah  right  we want it to it's not it's not no. Yep. Fifteen  oh  too bad. Oh but with special colour we have. A special form  right? Oh  we don't have any buttons  so Yeah  we need to uh No  uh we have fifteen and oh  right. We could lose the curve. Yeah  I would lose the curve. But you can't push it  so you have to tap. Yeah  alright. So normal scroll wheel? And I think we should lose the curve. Yeah  but if you would i it is a new feature  it it's something special. No  the curve doesn't really No  then it will won't uh stand up from the table. Then it would just Yeah. So We would lose this one? Yeah  we could s yeah  a bit. Sixteen point three. So we still Could could we do it on a regular chip on print or something? No? Ma y you just can't do that  or uh We changed th Yeah  and the single curved to uncurved. No. Yeah  but it's t Yeah  but it is uh it it is a new feature  it is something special. I don't know. Yeah  that's difficult. Yeah. Uh. We could make it titanium instead of rubber. Oh. Oh can I ask something? What is special colour? Is that the wood uh wood uh this  we have to have that one too? Th then we still have too much if we use the uh Yeah  we we scrap that one? See  a po three. We need point three. Uh it's a colour. Don't make it wood. Make it uh Yeah  but it's it's special colour  is it a all kind of colours? It's also green or uh Yeah  but it's a special colour than just rubber colour. You have to add something to the rubber to make it green. You don't say here's green rubber. Yeah  you can  you should you have to lose No  it is the scroll wheel  I guess. A push  yeah. Switch colours. It was such a great idea. What do you mean? Oh. But I think when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber then you use special colour  'cause you have to add it. Yeah  so you always lose the special colour. You co you could make it always black  like normal remote. Oh right  yeah. Yeah  we should u Yeah. We have to make this like four or five or something. That's what it means. Yeah. Oh right  yeah. Is it per remote? Yeah. Yeah  that's right  and you one colour per remote. So then it is one. No. One. So it would be curved  single curve. Or not? So y you just can't make a nice remote. It's too bad for the speaker. Should we change that tha that that's a one if not  or not? Could you copy it? And make it uh The entire uh Perhaps you can then copy page or so. Ooh. No. Oh you you made the entire could you Oh not Well. Would you? By the Perhaps you can save this one  and then copy or something. Add it copy page. Select all. Alright  something went wrong. It doesn't work. Let's forget. Yeah. Oh ignore that. Well  so Too bad. Yeah. The microphone. Yeah. A and we changed something  I guess  or not? We Oh no. Yeah  I tried to copy that one  but it didn't work. So we could fix it like tha that it's like this. You could select it all  but then you can't erase. Erase. When you saw th li uh Earlier when we selected it  w I couldn't erase anything. Just tap somewhere. Yeah. I don't think I can  but uh we can try. Oh  yeah  no  ha-ha. Yeah  we tried it earlier. It's very much work. Yeah  goodbye mic. Oh  I already erased half of the line. Too bad  oh. Like this? Still looks nice. Oh  that's erase. Yeah  that's a bit weird. Oh  now I'm line. Yeah. No  it's weird. Yeah. Bu but stressful. You think  no  my presentation isn't ready. Yeah. Yeah  you had information I didn't have and then uh Oh right. Yeah. Yeah. No. Yeah  you could Yeah. I think so too. Yeah  but then you can work together too when A chat would also be uh Well  I I don't really like the board  it doesn't really work great. Sometimes I think. It does work  but sometimes it doesn't erase or it doesn't uh Yeah. Yeah. But Well it is useful  but it doesn't really work all the time. Th the pen doesn't The line is a bit off. Yeah  you can point to where you want the line to be. But Yeah. Yeah. I I I used it  it it was you can use it  it's quite handy I think. Yeah  I used it to y to Yeah  it did work pretty well. I don't think why you would want to use it actually  but it it does work. Yeah  and then you can show it to everybody. It doesn't really write normally. It's a bit Yeah. I think it was great  yeah. Yeah  but it was because we didn't uh Yeah. I thought it was good  but uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well. Yeah. And you get get stuff from the from the computer  but Yeah. You just sit there for ten minutes. Yeah  where is that email? Oh did you? Is it on there? Is it on there? I didn't find the didn't look but uh I didn't look  but I got like one email after ten minutes or something. That's what we said. And it not a lot uh No  the first one. I didn't know uh nee. And I didn't know what to do for the first ten minutes before we got here  so I went  right. Yeah. Just looking at the screen and uh Yeah  an Yeah  that will be handy. Yeah. Yea uh so tha actually you could make an L_C_D_ screen but no mic  or it could make mic but no L_C_D_ screen  when you look at that. Yeah. Uh  I dunno. Think that's about it. Hmm. Heavier um less heavy laptops. Yeah. But that's not really uh Yeah. Yeah  everything worked. Yeah  but it's just the the off hours between that you will work alone. Then it pops up pop up screen came. Five minutes in the meeting. No. Huh. You did? Well Oh  right. Well Yeah. Champagne. Yeah. Do we get another email? I I think we have to fill in a questionnaire again  but We do? Yeah. Uh th that that one? You can just Yeah  but it's it isn't a picture or  well  is it? No  isn't possible. But you can make a screen shot  I think. Yeah. Uh oh  export. Images. How big do you want the images? Yeah. This one? This one? Um Well it isn't on the desktop. You can only save it in my documents. Oh. Oh  alright. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Three. Can we stay here? Yeah. Yeah  alright. Why can't we stay here? Yeah. Good. So well uh welcome everyone. Um as you may have noticed I uh created separate folders because it was uh tending to get a little busy in our uh shared project documents uh folder. I don't know if everybody uh put their own uh documents in the right folder  which is for now the detailed design meeting. Yeah. Then I'll move this one. Oh no  this is just one big document  so you can leave that wherever it is. And we have a evaluation left here. Okay. Well not main documents this time. Oh uh yes. I have it open myself I guess. Um well the detailed design meeting Huh? We're finally getting somewhere hopefully. Um what are we going to do? I've opened it already. Um I'm still going to take some minutes  and if I'm right  you two are going to give a prototype presentation? Aren't you? Yes  you are. And uh m did you do something with evaluation criteria? Good. And we have a correct agenda. And uh then we have to look at something which is less nice  the finance uh aspect  whether we can afford what we have designed  and if we can we can uh commence the final part which is the production or project evaluation  how did we work together and what are the results  and how happy are we with those. Okay  well finance uh will be later. Now I'd like to give the word to you two. So a separate button for for text  okay. Mm-hmm. Thank you. Looks good. And I just missed when I was typing The R_R_ stands for? Logo  okay. Okay well I would have recognised it if it were the right colours of course. Okay  the evaluation criteria  huh? Well it's looks fancy  especially with the green colour. And the the curves which we decided  huh? Only what happened to the single curve we spoke about last meeting? Well it might work one time  huh. Okay. Okay  but we have to rate uh these things now? Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well I think uh especially because of the microphone and the L_C_D_ screen also. Very new thing. Well Fancy the old people will. No  it's a two. Little bit strange we have to judge that ourselves  huh? Well I'd say two on a scale No  okay well  that's true. Okay  one two. That doesn't matter that much  so make it a one. Yeah m Yeah  and you use these buttons the most  huh? So So which So which number are we going to fill in? A two  yeah? Two  three and what do you think? Okay  so we have two  two  three. A two  okay  because we have to It's the box below it  huh? Otherwise we have two results in one question. Okay  next question. Okay  you're very enthusiastic about your own design  huh? As well for the for the older people? And would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition? Because that might Yeah. Okay  well M maybe that's the most user friendly and easy to use. Yeah  well maybe that would make it even more easy to use for them. I'd say three. Okay  so we have three three two two or So what are we going to do? Okay  a three  I see. Uh Another question. No. Yeah. Yeah  but I think you should make it one scale with with one being good and seven being bad  because otherwise we can't uh calculate anything from the results  so Okay  a one  because we designed for that  huh? Yeah. Yeah  and I though w we had about single colours  but you can also make uh a wood colour  not just one single colour but a wood-like thing  can't you? Whether it looks like wood  it isn't w it isn't wood but You can make a print on rubber  can't you? Yeah. So that's a one then  huh? Do you have many questions? Oh  okay well Yeah  but we have We also We have to get to the money. What spongy. Uh-huh  yeah. Yeah  so isn't hard to lose you. Yeah  but a har A hard to lose is good. So it should this question should be hard to lose. It's difficult to lose it. A two. A two. Okay. Yeah  it's okay. That happens above also. But maybe when you scroll away and back it will be normal  but Yep. Oh  it isn't  well okay. Remember. There. Well I think it's it's uh a lower number  so better because w we designed it for young people especially  didn't we? What do you think? Questions? Two. Uh-huh. Dissatisfy younger people. Um Yeah  but those are more fancy functions  not not really many features or something. It has relatively few features  with Yeah. Ours had other features with Okay  you think one  what do you think? You. three  yeah. I'd say three  so two it is then or Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Yeah  maybe maybe two. Well m th but the logo is on on the front  so a two  yeah  that's Oh  well that's that's pretty good  huh? That was your evaluation uh show  okay  so we don't have to calculate anything because of um these results. Okay  good. Um let's see oh  it isn't asked to save but it did already And this Everything okay. Well  the next part uh might be a little bit difficult to do in a group  but I am willing to try it. Because we are going to look at the finance and I have a nice Excel sheet to do that. And um I'm not sure if I put it in the project folder. look on that. Um and we're going to calculate the production costs  and if they are uh under or at twelve Euro fifty  we're good  and if they're not we're going to uh re-design  but we have to do that uh very very quick I think  yes. Um I don't know if I put the Excel sheet in the n not in the folder. I think it's I think it's still in my own documents folder. Oh shit. So Okay  well this is it. Um maybe I could ask one of you to uh fill it in  so that I can also uh take minutes  and uh maybe the other can uh use that thing to count uh numerous functions. Well we have to count some things and we have to think about some things. But you have to fill in this column  huh? No  uh count uh number of functions  because for every button you have to pay and there are different screen shots  so or different different screens  so Yeah  but it's it's more about the energy source  huh? Do you use a hand dynamo  a battery  kinetic or solar cells? We'll wait. Yeah. I'll just fill it in. Um rubber indeed? Yeah  I think that will be our best bet. And what did you change? You changed the uh scroll wheel and Oh  but it's just one point  so maybe you should should uh Yeah  you should you should drop the speech recognition. And then you can keep the curve. Or can't you? Or make it on a hand dynamo  but I don't think that will work. Yeah  mm-hmm. Yeah  but uh a wooden remote control only helps for uh old people we discussed  yes? Yeah  but it's only a half. But I think the only option is to drop the uh sample speaker. Yeah  but isn't it per remote that you pay? Half? I think you pay half per remote. So each remote with a special colour. I hope. So the battery  we have um advanced chip on print. Because of thing Yeah  well you can at least make it curved again. Because that was very important  huh? So it's curved  it's still that so we we dropped the speech recognition together with the speaker. We dropped the scroll wheel. And the rest is the same  huh? Am I right? Yes. No  but you c yeah. Okay  but this this new remote we can afford. Hmm? No  I hadn't. I just received it. They don't work so hard at the finance department. Yeah  and that's it. Twelve Euro fifty. Um and did you try to make a new design  or what were you trying to do? It didn't work. Hmm. Strange. Oh  you can arrange Hmm  can't you then just say copy? New page. Paste. Yes. Select none. Okay  and now you can erase. Well it should be possible. Oh no. Well you can draw over it with white uh pen. Oh. Yeah. Sorry. Well but that's also useful for the evaluation  because I think uh we have a prototype now which we can afford and uh we only need to draw a little bit to get a good uh design. Doodle. And I think we should then move on to the production evaluation because of the time. Let's see  we can save this now. And move back to here. Mm-hmm. And then all green. Okay  well thank you. Oh  no. Hey  but you can erase that. Uh-oh. Right. And you can't erase this? Hmm  strange. Okay  well uh just leave it at this and quickly save. Um and then we are going to the project or product evaluation. We just did our project evaluation. Um well  I think I can sit for that since it's almost my final slide. Um what did you think about uh the process? How satisfied are we? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. And you could ask things. And for me it sometimes was a surprise who was going to present what  huh? And uh Yeah. So you would say uh communicate during our individual uh work. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well  probably to simulate the whole working uh process  huh  th you can't have a meeting uh for several weeks. No. So you don't think the SMARTboard is is really useful or Yeah  so it's maybe a bit unnatural also. That wasn't me. Uh so um the means  we discussed the smart board  and what about uh this digital pen? Yeah  well I use it as a a normal pen and and and only you use it to uh get it on the computer  huh? Yeah. Yeah. Okay  um and what about the teamwork? Yeah  well I think so too. we Yeah  but that was it was our assignment  huh? Okay  and maybe I should walk out of the room when you discuss uh this point  the leadership. Yeah well  okay. And creativity? Well  when we look at this I'd say we have been creative  huh? But There was room for You did? Well  I didn't have time for that. At some times I Sometimes I received like like five emails at at one moment  and then I even got spam. Or something like that. And I was working and working and work Okay  well um but after all we can say uh we are satisfied  but it it could've been uh better. When we get uh when we have we would have gotten uh more information. Yeah. Yeah  that was a bit mean to put it in the end. And uh what were the other points to to improve this whole process? Yeah  they're pretty heavy. And so more time uh w might have improved the the quality of work  is what you say. Okay. Okay  so more time during the individual work phases. Um okay well uh I just got my warning for the last five minutes  so I'll move on to I guess my last slide  yes  which is the closing. Well uh  we managed  but we did it very quickly. I don't know if that's the best way to when it isn't is it when it is too expensive to quickly re-arrange it and say  okay  this is it  but we had to do it  huh  because we have to have a design  and that is within the budget. And we evaluated. Maybe we should re-evaluate uh the product  but we did that before  and we also evaluated the project. And I think uh everybody's uh very happy. At least I am  with the results  so uh celebration  well  for the three of you  because uh I have to write the final report now. But uh well  thank you very much for your co-operation  and I had a very nice day so far. Okay. Um Yeah I have t I think we also have to go to our own rooms again  but um well I at least. But maybe you can try uh to make a screen shot of this  so I can try to include it in the final report. Yeah  maybe. wants to  but at least this one. I know  we should remove this  but it won't h Okay. And uh please put it in the project folder then  huh. Okay  well I uh I hereby officially close the meeting and uh I hope to see you uh soon. Well  I think we'll be a bit a bit longer  but okay. Well  happy celebration  huh? How big? Uh not too big. Whatever you think is good. ,The ID and UI presented the drawing of a prototype. It is rounded  with the front made of hard plastic in different colours. The back  as well as the lower part of the front are made of titanium. The back has the logo and slogan of the company engraved in its middle. The buttons include oval digit buttons  arrow-shaped channel and volume controls in the middle; below those  is the menu (for the LCD) and the video button. The LCD can be found at the lower section of the device. After the presentation  the product was evaluated. This was done on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad) on fancifulness  ease of use  finding the device when it is lost  hi-tech features  incorporation of fashion trends  and ergonomic design. Because it was over budget  titanium was replaced by plastic and the speech recognition was discarded. They thought it would have been more sensible to have the component costs before the prototype design. Finally  the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (generally satisfied)  leadership (the process was democratic  not happy with management)  teamwork (happy with it)  and means (SMARTboard was 'a disaster' and the digital pens only good for drawings). 
Du Uh we yes s I've lo I've done the role that I was asked to do anyway. I think. Slide show. Just press the arrow keys I think. Usually goes to it. Is is it j just just just using it yeah. A repetitive strain injury. Just repetitive strain injury. I think. That's what I guess. Yeah. Having just listened to what Corinne just said  I'll draw on some of the things as well. Some things that sort of relevant to what I wanna say. 'Kay so I'm just gonna yeah approach the technical functions design. Um the method I used was to explore the uh technical functions of a remote control. And t s simplest approach that I came to is is to change  programme and operate an electronic device remotely. I mean that's an obvious thing to say  but it's not attached to the device that you want to control. Um I had some things sent to me. Not very much. To look at similar devices. Um defined in some them. And then the personal preferences that I will suggest. Um we discussed a universal one. Um like it's just been brought up again then. But I think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design  and po possibly within maybe the budget that we do it  um because you'd need to know all the spef specifications of a all the like electronic companies. I'm not sure have you ever come across a universal remote control yourself  but you have to i they're a nightmare to use. You have to set them  reset them to everything. Um and that would only add buttons. Whereas I think the aim is to take away buttons. So I think it'd be better maybe to concentrate on maybe just a universal one for T_V_s. Um or maybe just one that you could we could design and then different people  manufacturers could use it to set to their specifications  if if the aim is to get something that's unique in design. Um Okay here here's just two pictures of remote controls. They're just simple T_V_ remote controls. But one is uh user-centred. That is the one on the left. And you can straight away see there's less buttons. And the other one is engineer-centred where that's more uh specified for the sort of the elaborate piece of equipment it's trying to control um which appeals more to the product that we want  and on what the have said and the market research and stuff probably looking at something that should be user-centred. Fewer buttons  simpler to use  and if ten percent um is hidden away if ten percent is what's used  maybe the other fifty percent  the buttons that are used very rarely like programming  they could be hidden maybe under some remote controls you might have come across have maybe a little flip thi thing where they're hidden away. And the main buttons are the ones you or the ones you come across. Um and finally  um uh sort I've sort of covered that  our product I think should be user interface orientated. Um Like I said to concentrate on T_V_ remote control  a universal remote might be too complex. Um and as what it  the major findings market researchers have said  it's the image and the appearance that people di dislike. So that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend. And then and change the fashion of remote controls. And that's it. On something on the image of it. Uh the f the actual design. I think speech recognition was uh one of those things where um they have to be really good for them to work. 'Cause sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and o if it's on your phone. And you need to sort of take into light languages and then different dialects I suppose as well. Yeah. Yeah. And wou I don't know if would would you want to keep saying stuff if you were watching stuff. If you were watching something would you sort of be wanting Yeah. I think As well it'd be j the gimmick factor for the younger people. But practically I don't think it's Yeah. It'll wear off. Do you wanna put your cord back in? I did have have a thought about the sort of the tracking thing. Is that if it came with maybe a holder or holster  whatever you wanna call it. Um that you you should put it back in. Your remote. But if you don't put it back in  you press something like a little button on that  and that just sort of sends out a beep to find where it is or something. Just by infrared. That shouldn't be too complex I would've thought. Yeah it would be quite good. The ball could sit on a Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'll yeah I'll have a look  try look at the actual appearance in the next break. I th I I do still think it needs to be something that is ultimately one-handed. The ball is probably not a good idea. And even something that's held like that might be difficult. So that I think it still has to be a variation. On maybe a a rect on a rectangle but maybe not necessarily as boring  as plain as a rectangle. D I don't know if that might cope with like the trend-watching. I find anything more on that. Yeah. Bottom perhaps yeah. You I mean it might be to look at sort of the the shape and trend of like things like mobile phones  and the shapes that the they've been going. They've gone from big brick block things  which is a remote control is  to sort of slinky small things. Yeah. Yes s To the thumb yeah. Maybe the buttons could like uh decrease in s the bigger ones you know they could actually be bigger in size than the ones that are less important  the smaller here. Yeah. Behind. Definitely. just like o on a sort of side view. Something that you know it would sort of fit in the hand better. So you know you just sort of have your hand Yeah. Right on the and your thumb would be up here type thing. Yeah that's also true. instantly sort of always going for the right-handed person. But I mean the older so Right-handed  yeah. I mean I'm just just thinking maybe if it was um circular um with the sort of that sort of the sort of early idea we had  with the way that was more like that  whereas this is just a one-handed thing that you sort of almost wrap round the thumb. So you'd have your  you'd put your hand into there with the thumb there. And then your thumb would do you'd have all the buttons sort of round here. And that I think could work. On any hand. If you just had it like wrapped round there. Left or right. Minimise its size. It could be you know really quite small. Yeah. Zapping functions. Yep. Yeah. How well it'll work yeah. Yeah. Hm. Yep. Sure. What was it? Function? F_ eight? Well. How do I get it Oh right right right. That one? Okay. Alright. Well  this is my report  which is going to be based pretty much on a survey that I was sent. Oh gosh  I've no idea. G Okay. Sorry I actually need to see something else on my screen. Yeah. And then? Again? No I want something else on mine. Is that possible? Okay but now you don't have that. Sorry guys. So is there no way I can give you the slideshow and have something yeah. Yeah. Oh well. Yeah. It's okay. Okay. Um so first of all  the method that I used was by doing some marketing research  by um doing research on some interviews that were conducted. And then some internet research. And I was sent a report that was I think there were a hundred remote users that they interviewed. And so I will show you some of the results from that  which I think will be helpful. Um okay here are some of the findings. They said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls. And seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly. Which is a fairly significant number I would say. And eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy. So I think that earlier we were onto something when we were talking about having it be a modern cool look  I think that's definitely important. Um they say that current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user. Seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot. And if anyone could clarify what that means? Zap  does that just mean like changing the channel? Okay. Um and fifty percent of the users say that they're only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote control. And there was something else  they kept track of the frequency per hour in using certain buttons. And some of them it looks like barely need to be included at all. Of course channel selection is used the most frequently. And then teletext was the next. Volume and then power. And then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used. So I think we could definitely eliminate or somehow combine a lot of the functions into one button. Um the biggest user frustrations  as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere  and so I think a tracking device of some sort would be a good idea. They said it take thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote. And twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for R_S_I_. What is it? Okay. Okay. And so bas okay. Um as far as speech recognition goes  um the younger group looks like they're all for it. From the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more. And it kind of just went down incrementally. The groups at the older they get it looks like the less willing they are to pay  so maybe we could discuss this and think and decide if we think it's worth investing in this. At least if we're targeting the younger groups. And so in conclusion. Some things that I drew from this are that I think we were correct. We definitely need to focus on a new modern appearance  since so many people seem to be concerned about the ugliness of their remote control. Um a multifunctional remote could be a good thing to explore. So you only have one rather than five different remotes sitting all over your room. Uh we need to simplify the remote and reduce the number of buttons  get rid of the ones that don't seem to be serving much purpose. And then lastly I thought that maybe we could discuss the idea of speech recognition. And that's it. Oh yeah. Sorry did you guys get time to write everything that you needed? 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Another thing about these figures is ninety one percent of the youngest age groups said they'd do it  but probably a lot of them that's actually their parents money. Like I don't know if they would actually go out and purchase this themselves  a fifteen year old you know. Yeah. Gets old yeah. Mm. Mm. Rolls away yeah. Not really. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah not yet but maybe by the next meeting we'll have some info on that. Mm. Mm. Power. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Right. Uh-huh. Maybe you could buy like a special left-handed version of the remote. Special order. Yeah. Mm. Hmm. Could be good. Yeah  yeah. Mm-hmm. Eight. F_ eight. Just jus yeah. cable there. Thank you. Okay. Gonna talk to you about the working design of the interiors basically which is what dictates the design the both the interface basically and the outer appearance because this is all the stuff that needs to go in there. Right. So unfortunately the people who were supposed to do this little presentation for me obviously were too drunk to actually accomplish it  so um I'm going to do a lot of the stuff on the board. Um just This is the basic basic premise of a remote control. Um the basic function is to send messages to another system. Okay so much is clear. An energy source feeds an integrated circuit  like a chip  that can compose messages. Often in the form of infrared bits. This is the most mostly used. Um there's uh also some sound systems but infrared is the better or the more more used system. Um parts are cheaper as well. A user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages. This is where my people screwed up basically. So I'm going to explain that on the board rather. Um what we have is different components that obviously need to go in there. We'll start with an energy source. Right. Um which is usually a battery right? Since it's not feasible to add a cable to that. This energy source of course is connected to the the user interface itself. Uh which can be buttons  whatever  which in fact controls a chip. Right? This is the user interface and there we have the chip. Um the way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp. That sends out the signal. Of course the signal differs accordingly. Um depending on what the chip tells the infrared lan lamp. And Of course that's controlled  the chip itself is controlled by the user interface. The way you normally normally do it is that you add a little device such as a lamp to the whole thing as well  so that you know that it's working basically. You press something  you get a response. Which is also comparatively um important on one of those devices. Now this  what we're talking about here  or what I think should be discussed are these two components mostly. The the uh energy source for one thing can be altered. What we probably cannot alter is of course the infrared  the sending device basically  the infrared lamp. We cannot change the chip which controls the infrared lamp. Right? These two are components that we have to use  and these are dictated by the whole function of the whole thing. Um the lamp can be put onto the desi the device. It c it doesn't have to be there. This can be discussed as well. The user interface. That's something we can also discuss. Um as we've heard uh speech recognition is the hype obviously in the moment. Speech recognition um interface  we don't know that. Or if we just do the usual button thing. Or we have a touch pad or something like that that's something we can discuss. And of course the energy source. Batteries. Solar cells. Who knows? Of course it's always a question whether these these components are in fact available cheap enough  developed enough. But that's like I s I suppose rather up to marketing  and not to to the industrial design department. Expensive it's gonna be get uh. Yeah. Right. Oh right. go. Mm-hmm. Well you still do. You s you still W yeah. You put it on t on the couch table. While you're watching  it's gonna roll off. So that's not an issue really.. Right. That's Mm. Right. Hm. That's the classical design. Right. Yeah. Talking of which maybe a scrolling function is not not too bad. It's Talk about maybe f look at that from the side  there maybe. Which is technically the easiest option. Would probably be like a scrolling  little scrolling wheel like this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So. Yeah  sort of like that. You can even if we're coming from mice  we can even add a click function  where you  in order to verify the information you just press it down. Right. Also when it comes to the ergonomics of the whole thing  if you wanna make it square for the looks of it  then maybe to make it more comfortable to hold the whole thing  you add a little bulge down here. Just which maybe from an engineering point this could be holding the the batteries and so on. I know. You know what I'm getting at here  fel look at it from the side. It's like that. Right. Uh Then you hold it in your hand like this. And maybe you bring the buttons nearer to the or the imp more important buttons nearer to the to the side. Right. Mm. Right. You can also have it  maybe  talking about mobile phones again  sliding open. With the lesser used functions on this part  and then it slides into that part. And out. Mm well I was just thinking  this this of course causes causes a problem um for left or right-handed people actually. So. Right. Right. That's right. Right. That minimises it size-wise as well. Mm. Then there's maybe another point of making it a two-in-one kind of thing. If we have a smaller a smaller device that actually fits into the big one. You give it the full functions in here  and just a couple of functions in there. Like your zap zapping device is just u channels up-down  uh volume  and on-off. That's it. Maybe. That's right. Means the big one has to be sufficiently big. And perhaps heavy  so you can't move it around. Make it a piece of furniture. yes. Yes  there you go. Or a statue or something. Right. Alright. Alright. Alright. Oh. Okay. Thanks for coming to this meeting. S how we doing on our remote? We have some we have some ideas and some uh ideas for what people want. Yeah. Alright let's just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting. See if I can't get things uh moving along here a little bit better. Um I'll go over what we went over last time  which shouldn't take long. Then I believe each of you have a presentation. Um I've was sent a a couple more requirements for our remote  what they want. Um then we can come to a conclusion on uh what we want the remote to do  um and how it's going to do it hopefully. And uh then we'll have the closing. Um which we'll have forty minutes for. Uh let's see  the last meeting we went over um who was responsible for what. I'm responsible for leading the meetings  keeping the notes  uh and coming up with the final presentation. Um Corinne is our Marketing Expert. She's gonna figure out what what um the consumer wants. Um Ryan is our User Interface Designer. And Manuel is the Industrial Designer. So you're gonna come up with the ideas Ryan  and you're gonna pick 'em apart. Um we decided our remote  uh we want it to be a universal remote uh that everyone would want. Um we want to be modern  um fun  different. Uh it needs to be sturdy  um easy to find  so we gonna have that locator function. Um and we want to be different. Um and then we went over a couple of different ideas. Ball-shaped phone. The keyboard shape. Um we decided that it should probably be one-handed. Something we could use with one hand. Um and that was our last meeting. So um why don't um Do each of you have a presentation? Okay. I'll hand it off to you and um Does anyone do you wanna go first? So we can maybe see what uh what the people want. To go to the next one? Yeah you click on that guy. Yeah. Hit F_ eight again. I think. Yeah. You want it to be on both screens  or just just yours? Yeah but I think you have to hit escape. And then you can Yeah. Oh hit F_ eight again. I know. I did the same thing. And then it should come up here shortly. 'Kay. I think oh give us the slideshow and something on your screen? Mm. I'm not sure. You could maybe minimise that screen and then have them both up at the same time I think. 'Kay. Very nice. Now we actually have some ideas of what what people want  what we should focus on. Uh Wait can I look at that real quick?. What was your last conclusion on that one? Focus on uh the i the image of it. 'Kay. Good. Good. So we could the the the more complex we make it of course  the more expensive But people have said that they would well younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote. So possibly it might be worth the investment. I agree. Well I myself I find  when you  h when there's something like spee speech recognition. Like uh you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power or something. Sometimes they have a a speech recognition on the other end  and you say one for this  and you find yours  like you said  saying the same thing over and over and over. I find myself  especially if I'm in a crowd of people  looking really silly. So maybe if you're sitting on your couch with a bunch of people then you know  you Volume up. Volume down. Change the channel  you know channel up  channel down? I I don't know. Mm-hmm. It's a  it's a gimmick factor that they like at first  and Okay. Um Let's see here. Yeah I guess so. Trade you. Now I was sent a couple of things to modify our uh new requirements. Um the remote's only gonna be for the television  which is good because we already decided y your your research showed that uh not only is a universal remote more complicated  it's more cost  more costly. And your re uh research showed that you know most of the people don't even use it. I think uh you said fifty percent of the people only use half the or ten percent of the buttons. So if we remove the universal remote then that solves that problem. Um no teletext. Um So we don't have to worry about that. Um but we do have to use the the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan  which is we put the fashion in electronics. And our corporate colours are grey and yellow. And we could probably get away with black too but So those are the three um the three new requirements that that I was told we need to use. Um from all all three of your uh presentations  I think that we were on the right track a lot in our last meeting. Um We want something that looks good. Um we want something that's simple. We want something that you can find easily. Um And the speech recognition I I guess is kind of uh give or take. It's gonna cost more. S the young the younger people say that they like it. But um it's probably  I would say  probably not worth the investment at this point in time. So maybe we should just do away with speech recognition. Um And that way we can focus on our form. That'd be  that'd be good if we were going with our our ball. Or or with you know I guess with any form that that would be good. You know that could be the charger. For you know we could use rechargeable batteries in the remote. And that would be or solar. Or you know However  however you wanted to go about it  the holder could also be the charging unit. Um With the locator button. Um and if it were the ball you'd no longer have to have a flat space on it. Um like if we still have the how to hold on to it and It's gonna roll away. Um So I guess after the meeting we'll have some questionnaires. And uh and some summaries for for what's going on. Um then we'll take lunch. Then we can come back and uh work on our individual work. Um I'll do the minutes. Uh let's see. It looks like you're already on your way for uh working with the components. Um chips  the what chips we need and what uh you know how to power it and whatnot. User interface concept  we want it to be something simple. Um Minimal number of buttons. I guess our  I guess our main um main thing that we should focus on until then is probably deciding on a certain look  you know. Did you have time earlier to to work on that. Did you guys feel you have enough time in between our meetings to get everything done that you need to get done? 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Um Shall we maybe shoot for a a specific uh target group? That way we could l I mean if it were  if we were shooting for young guys then it's um a certain look to the remote. Or girls or older people? Um Would that you think that would help us find um a specific form? That we would would wanna pick out? 'Kay. So um we know that the remote's gonna have to be we'll just say we've got a colour scheme for it. Um yellow and you know yellow it's nice and bright  with the buttons being grey or black. And our slogan pasted somewhere on it  on the the bottom or the you know. Um Maybe we could sketch a so basically all of our remotes all of our typical remotes now are just kind of a rectangular sort. You know. Um maybe we could flare it or something. You know. So it's more of course this will look like a bone then. go ahead and erase this. Um Hope everyone memorised that uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah everybody's got a mobile phone right? Except for me now. Uh But they are all  you know  mobile phones um they've kind of taken a turn to where they're really small. Um which may defeat our purpose for being able to locate our remote all the time. But then again you don't want you know like the first mobile phone that was this big and you had a handbag to carry it around in. Um So we've got basically what remotes look like now is kind of what we're what we're stuck with. Um Maybe we could go with a square or something. Um Um you know with minimal number of buttons. I guess you've got you know one through nine. For typing in your channels. Uh you've got volume  up and down. Channel up and down. Power. Usually at the top. Um a mute. That's that's pretty much all you need I think. Um A menu button  maybe. So you know. If you  if we want the remote to do other things like um or I guess the T_V_ to be able to change the tint and the colour and you know all those kind of things that are built into T_V_s  we just have that under one standard menu button where you go in  press the menu button  scroll up and down to select it. Um 'Kay so Um Mm-hmm. Like a wheel on your mouse. Sort of. 'S a good idea. Mm-hmm. Look g yeah. Looks good. To the thumb. Yeah. Yeah is everyone who in here's right-handed  left-handed? You guys all right-handed? Yeah. So I'm left-handed but I  so I can say that most things are designed for right-handed people. Like the written language. Or English. Maybe. Ow. I would say I mean it should be probably designed for a right-handed p person. Um but that's that's good. That's w I think we've got a kind of a good plan there. Um At least for what buttons we're gonna use. Um So we've got uh I like the scroll  the scroll action and the. Yeah. Kinda like holding a Yeah. So two remotes in one. But then would be easier to lose one or the other. It actually is your coffee table. Okay. Well we need to finish up here. Um So for the next So for the next um before the next meeting w uh sh shall we work on you're watching trends to see what what kind of new information we've got going on. Um Manuel you're going to work on the components for for what we're gonna use. Let's go with our our uh rounded kind of fit in your hand let's explore uh the the uh possibility of having the two-piece. So one for the the quick zapping um and possibly one you know with just that rounded part that fits into your hand. Um And Ryan you work on um how how well they'll work with the us with the user. So both of those concepts. And uh okay I think we made some good progress here. see you in I dunno. I gu I guess we'll take lunch in about uh half an hour. Or I guess we'll be taking lunch shortly and then then in about half an hour after that we'll probably have another meeting. Okay. ,The project manager opens the meeting by introducing herself and asking everyone to say their name and role in the group. She then states the agenda of the meeting and tells them that they will be designing and creating a new remote control that should be trendy and user-friendly. The meetings will focus on functional  conceptual  and detailed design. Next  each group member draws their favorite animal on the whiteboard and explains the characteristics of that animal. After that the project manager covers the project budget  and then they begin discussing their personal experiences with remote controls and how they want their remote to look. Then the project manager closes the meeting by telling each group member what to do in preparation for the next meeting. 
Hello. Oop. Okay. Okay  we're just going to the later. So we're going to talk about the conceptual model. So that's me. Uh okay. So Uh okay. Okay  so I just show you the m the no mm mm the the the the the the minutes  minute. What's it called  I dunno. Whatever. Okay  so we just talked about uh Oh you want me to show that there or Okay  we just talked about it looks. Has to look nice. Usability is very important. People don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones. Um It has to be very basic  not too many buttons. Light switches on if you use a button. Uh text T_V_ still has to be a possibility. And it has to be easy to learn. That were the things I uh make minutes of. And the functions are volume  channel to choose channels  an on-off  a mute uh button  and a text T_V_ button. That are the functions. That right? Okay. So I just want to give you uh Mike again  the first uh presentation of your Yeah. But we already have the flashing flashing light on the Okay. Yeah. Hmm. But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea  because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground. So it has to be flexible. That's a good That's a good idea. If it's de like that. That's good  a good idea. Is it a bit like like the the the the remote control? R_ soft. Okay. Yeah. It's very uh difficult to to to do it. Because it's only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control. Okay. But that's definitely more expensive than Yeah  but a telephone Okay  yeah. But a telephone also have a L_C_D_ and and it's about t two hundred Euros. So uh Yeah  just modern modern but still uh basic. Yeah  maybe the teletext tel No. Yeah. Yeah. But it sounds very difficult to use. Because um the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it. So you can't use your thumb for it. Yeah  down there. But it's not not the best best. Yeah  for volume. For volume  or a channel. Yeah  why not. And the channels as well. Oh yeah. Yeah  that's better. Yeah  just th th th other buttons like text T_V_. Put that on the button bottom. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Except from the on-off button. Yeah. Yeah  that's cool. Okay. We have to decide this this lecture  or this this this uh fifty minutes  yeah  how it is gonna look. Okay  so Hmm  okay. Yeah  we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the remote control. So the colours also. So we have ha to ma make it in black  black  yellow. Maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black. We make i Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front. Yeah  it's cool. Yep. And still trans Still still transparent. Okay. Yeah  we make it som Maybe we have to make it from soft material. Uh I'm not sure. Yeah. Just give five with them  just in a box. Five different Yeah. Cool. Yeah. It it could be like a Nokia  like plastic. That's better prob Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  that's cool. But maybe you can m make a uh round fluff or soft material. Just only the basic uh basic remote control from normal plastic  and the rounds of it from softer s I dunno. Y Cool. Yeah. Y i if you The numbers could be can be Yeah  that's right. They can choose. Blue. Yeah  but you can't choo You can't choose it when you buy it. You have to choose Is it Okay. Yeah  okay. Maybe put some different ones in it. Doesn't matter. It's just No  just some LED. Okay  cool. Just make it some different colours. Blue  red and green  or something. Yeah  we have to hurry up a bit  so Okay. Yeah  a recharger maybe. We still want to have a recharger  don't we? Is that still the A recha Oh no. Uh Battery. It's just a battery. Yeah. No  just rechargeable batteries. But normally you put a remote control on the table or on the couch. It's dark in the room. No. It's just batteries  that's cheaper. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. But it doesn't really matter  we just make it plastic. The scroll wheels  that's cool. That's for the volume. Yeah. Okay. I don't think that's an opportunity. Just skip it. Because we don't have time for that to to put it in. Yeah  okay. Okay. Oh just sk Maybe you have to skip that one as well. It's No. No. Yeah. But maybe the form has to be a bit different. Not the sh the square form. Just a bit more rounded. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  that's right. So We have to decide which one we're going to choose from these. What exactly. Because we have to know it. So the energy uh is the recharger. We already know that. Just a normal battery. Okay. The chip-on-print is a normal one. Okay  the case is just a plastic one. Yeah  re Yeah  regular. Yeah  okay. Yeah  regular. Okay. And we need a plastic case  with a scroll wheel. That's pretty much it. And a flashy light. So uh I'm not sure. But we do I don't know if we expected to draw on this one at this moment. But Yeah. That's for the next one. That's for th Uh that I think that's the next next meeting. But you definitely get a specific instruction. But th think about something that's more rounded. Just And more It has to be Uh a bit. Just just on the top or on the bottom. Maybe the wheel can be uh like uh like this. O um if you draw it like this  you get a What the fuck is it? Okay. Mm Doesn't work. You see what I mean? If I draw here It draws about four centimetres lower than Nah okay. Just. Maybe you can make it like this. And this is all the wheel for volume. So that you just um It's all rounded  so you can do uh turn this one. Yeah  but just not on the top  but uh on the side of it. Maybe  I dunno. Okay  so we have this at the moment. Okay  so we'd have this. Is that okay? And Like this. And uh what's the channel choose? Where do we uh put that? Still on the bottom or That's the numbers. It doesn't make a difference  if you put the s uh the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other. Because you already have the volume here  so You can also put it here one butt and the other one there. Next to each other. back and forth. So you can also can put it all on the top  and this  you keep this empty. Because you have to hold it as well. But that's not want to zap very quick  so Yeah? Is this a opportunity  or you don't want a different Why? But still the next It's still the next one. Doesn't make Yeah  but fo from left to right is exactly the same. It ma it doesn't make a big difference. But it's exactly th I dunno. I You already have the volume on the side  so you can't make it you can't ma make a mistake. So it's uh So but that's for that's for you  'cause it's Okay  so hmm. What did What else we have to discuss about? I dunno. Yeah. And the LED. Uh Yeah. Yeah. Uh the logo was has to be on there. Yeah  that's right. Yeah  five. Let's give five. So y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger? Is that is that a good good opportunity? So you could put it like that  okay. Uh I'm not sure. But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit. That's all. Yeah. Just round it up. No. Yeah. Yeah. No  just just the corners. Okay. Shapes. It's a bit annoying  isn't it? So we have to make a decision  what kind of form it's gonna have t going to have. And you have the scroll button inside. Okay. But why do we have to round it on the t bottom then? Of Skip that one as well. Okay. Yeah  it's cool. Rubber spongy. Okay  so we have s still one minute left. So just I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square. No. But I I think it's still for older people. You j still have older people. It's only annoying if it if it's like that f formed like that  like f Whatever. Just you have a normal But i it is it is it is already fancy. Because of the lights on the bottom of it. That's already fancy. Uh maybe maybe make the the mm the wha what's it called uh scroll wheel. Make it in in yellow or something. Just like the colours of Real Reaction. Yeah. It's right. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe the ones we are going to draw there. Maybe we have to ask uh to the the mm to her if it has if it can work better than this. Because it doesn't work properly. So maybe you have to ask her. Okay. Yeah. That's probably Okay  so just finish it. So we make it a bit like m that one probably. Yeah. Is that okay? Okay  only the colour and the flashy light and the We just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition. Or keep that? It's okay. But you'd definitely need a advanced chip. So Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well  okay? Yeah. The function of that in there. Yeah. And we need a Probably we need a uh advanced chip then. But it doesn't say anything about it  does it? It doesn't has to say anything. Just You have to just talk to Okay  we have to stop it now. So just Okay  that's a r That's that's a advanced Yeah  we just decide not to put it in  because it's too difficult. Okay  we just put it in  because it's a good feature. We have to stop now. Okay  just We have to stop it now. Bonjour. Why? Okay. Check check check check. The power light doesn't work. You turned it off. Okay. Oh. Hmm. Uh Shall I start? No. Okay well I received an email Okay. I searched the web  uh and uh I searched uh on this d document  recent investigation of the remote control market. It has been done in Italy uh Italy and in uh another country in Europe  I forget it. Uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel  instead of the current functional look and feel. So it's very important for us to create something new. So what Michael just said  it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls. Fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface. Uh this uh aspect is the most important one. Uh it came out of the research. It uh is twice important as the following. The second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative. Uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features. And then uh that uh This is a point of discussion  because we just decided that we don't make use of uh L_C_D_ or uh speech recognition. But um this is the second uh important uh aspect  and I think uh we must use some of the new technology  to be uh innovative. Uh maybe maybe something new. We have to discuss about it s uh Okay  uh features not uh do not exist in current remote controls. And that's very hard I think. Uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use. But uh that was an overall uh point. We already discussed that. Um I've got one picture. Uh d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy. So I took uh that part of the webpage. And it says uh fashion-watchers of uh uh Pari uh France and uh Italy  yeah  uh have detected the following trends. This trends I th uh trend I think it's not um that meaningful for us  maybe. But it's about uh clothes and shoes. But the uh the next uh aspect also in contrast to last year  the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy. But spongy  what what does spongy says? Spongy. Okay. Yeah. Yeah  it's something that uh it stand there. But I didn't knew uh knew what it means. So spongy means y Yeah. So it's also a stress-ball. Uh Okay? What do I think? Uh because a fancy look is the most important thing uh for remote control uh control  I think about changeable fronts. Uh maybe a see-through one in a a fruit front. Because it's uh it's hot. And uh some basic uh colour fronts. Uh so we can make uh five different fronts to start with or something. Uh maybe an extraordinary shape  like a sponge. Uh or uh  yeah  just another shape than a normal uh remote control ha uh has. Just uh something round in it  or uh maybe not uh not uh Yeah  I dun dunno. We have to discuss about that. Uh y yeah. Main point uh still uh is the technolo technological innovative. Yeah  how do we do that? Maybe speech? We ma must have some kind of gadget. So Intro Yeah. Yeah  that's the problem. That's the main problem. So Maybe we watch the first uh the next two presentations. Okay. Uh let's first watch Paul's presentation first then. Oh. It's mass production. So you can say  you can Yeah. But how uh we we're gonna make many of those. So we can start a mass production  and then the cost will still will be. Yeah. Okay. That was this? No  I don't uh I don't like it. Okay. Square. Like. Mm. Oh yeah. Uh uh Yeah. The the the new uh new modern uh remote controls  uh the buttons are part of the uh the style  I think is part of the remote control itself. It it's one uh a one uh out of one shape. Uh it's n doesn't Is uh a button uh um How do you say it? It it didn't it i it don't come out of the on the background. It is in uh the c a remote control uh Yeah. Yeah. Uh i Yeah  but can you change it if you already bought the the remote control? You Hmm. Okay yeah  you can you can change Yeah. No. Ah cool. Okay. Okay. Mm Uh but we have to do something about the trend. The trend is uh spong spongy uh and uh fruit or fresh fresh. And uh now we have nothing about uh about those those two. Uh yeah i Just Just on front. Neith uh I don't like it uh neither. Yeah  that's not not It's not al uh always the same. Every remote control's uh different. Yeah  we have to care that it r uh looks really new. Because uh we still hold on to the uh ordinary uh uh square uh remote control. 'Cause wha what I see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside. Yes. Okay. And a bit uh Some some kind of bling bling uh mm can we have Uh and how many uh fronts uh fronts do we put on the market then? Uh five or something? Or more or And um uh uh buy the product. You buy  you get one. And uh basic. Or you can choose one uh if you buy the project. Yeah  you sl uh you let it slide in the docking station. Yeah. Yeah  we can b It c it could be just just a square  just a packet. Yeah  but that's a round one. Maybe we can choose then. Yeah. Yeah. What do we do wrong? Hmm. Just just more like this and not uh a square. Okay. Yeah  it Uh it's very annoying. Okay. Uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh the t the trend is spongy and fruity. But yeah. It's not not a lot of trends I uh I found uh Uh It The th th Yeah. There is one There's just one overall important aspect is that we must make it fancy and it looks original  and I hope we can uh make it look not like the iPod itself. It must have uh uh uh a very different Yeah  they're all the same. Uh yeah  but uh if you the f uh front  the scroll wheel will still uh be yellow. No. If you set the pen yeah  he will draw here. Doesn't work. Yeah  I'll see it. Uh No. Oh that's hard. But Uh the ma the main points I I I uh just said. We have to be original and uh technological innovative. Becau Yeah. But Ma But we don't have any f information about the cost. We started with information about the cost was now th And how much is the chip? The the the And how how does it work? Is it No. Does it say does it say something back? Okay. Um Yeah. Fine. Okay. I received an email with uh a few possibilities on uh the materials. So I'll discuss them with you. Yeah. Mm no. Yeah. Hmm. Spongy. So rubber  kind of. Yeah. It's like a sponge. Yeah  somewhat like Yeah  I've some uh material uh information  but I'll give you it later in my presentation. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah  well actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost. But maybe it's cheap and it's easy to implement. Oh I got an email uh And it says uh the chip can be uh simple  regular or advanced. And Um They say uh a display requires an advanced chip. And this is more expensive than all the other chips. So it's m the most expensive. Yeah  it says in the email. The display requires an advanced chip. Yeah  probably too. I I haven't got anything about speech recognition  but Well it d That's that's the most expensive chip  we need. If we're doing uh if we're doing a display. Hmm. Hmm. But it That's on on the display. I think it is on uh on the bottom too. Yeah  okay. Yeah  I've I've got something of that uh too. Scroll. Yeah  or uh maybe uh The channel buttons are often used. And you can't use them now with your thumb  because the thing is not  it's not easy to control. Yeah okay  m maybe we cho should put that on top  and buttons we we don't use on  in the bottom. Because uh you can't hold it. You can't hold it th the control and push the buttons. But I I think w you'll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons  like one two three. So maybe we can put that on the bottom. Like zapping is just switching one channel at a time. Yeah okay. That's that's good  but Yeah okay. Yeah. Hmm. No  I think th the the top buttons are okay. They sh Those should be on top. But uh we we can switch those two  yeah. Yeah. No. Yeah  we have to keep it simple. Okay  the component design. I looked at uh some similar devices  and uh my own common knowledge. So uh this was on the web site. If you aim at a young public  you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green  blue  red. So flashy kinda colours. Uh shapes should be curved  so round shapes. Not Nothing square-like. Yeah. Yeah  but mm is uh has round corners I think. So we shouldn't have too square corners and that kind of thing. Yeah. And um sports and gaming device style characteristics. I don't know exactly what that means  but it should be  well yeah  popular kind of looking  I think. Okay. Yeah. Yeah  mm n Not that weird  because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy  to attract a young public. No  okay. That's a that's a sen That's just a matter of tastes  but We have to use uh kind of flashy colours  I think. Yeah. Like fronts in in red and yellow and blue and Okay. Well this is a remote control  a very old one. Um Then the components. The case has just a Here's black. But we are making it uh Yeah  I dunno. Maybe. But anyways uh it should be transparent. We decided that  huh? S Okay. Yeah  we could do that. Yeah  but y you could you could make 'em uh uh like blue and transparent. So you can still th look through it. Um the buttons. Normal rubber I think. Like normal ordinary buttons. Soft. With the hard hard buttons. Okay. Yeah  it's it's all on one level. Yeah  on one level. Yeah  I know what you mean. So we have to keep it on the one level. Like th the top it's Yeah. Yeah  okay. Okay  it's chos So that should be hard plastic. Then the buttons? I think. Or maybe Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And um Then the L_E_D_. The normal infrared L_E_D_ I think s sufficient. And back light L_E_D_s. So But I think we have to make the case transparent  otherwise the back light won't work. So if you put Okay. Yeah  but we can still make it transparent. So Or no Yeah okay. Good. And in green colour  the back lights or Yeah? No  but I think there are multiple colour LEDs. So I I know I dunno. Is Maybe it's it's more impor more expensive. I think it's Yeah  I dunno. Maybe it's too expensive  but it I th I don't think so. Then uh some more technical things. I don't know what it is  but it should be there I think. Um this is the normal circuit board  like a chip board in in a lot of uh things. W So we d we just need this and this transistors and resonators. There's all these kind of things. Um they they basically said that that's almost the same on any uh remote controls. So I guess we j we just need that. I don't know what they do or Nah  but they just said we need it. Uh the battery contacts  like normal batteries ca you can put in. Yeah okay. Yeah but Yeah  but it i We don't wanna have a ar an How do you call it? Accu. Y uh just just batteries  rechargeable batteries. Okay. Not a separate Okay. And uh a chip  that's this one. Then uh I received some possibilities. Um for the energy source we can use batteries or a kinetic uh Like with the pulse watch. So it operates on your wrist kinda. If you hold it. Yeah  I don't think it will work  and Or we can also use solar cells. But you mostly use it indoors  so Yeah  and and we can use the home station kind of thing. Um cases  flat  so uncurved. Uh two D_ curved is um like front to the back. And three D_ curved is also in depth. So that's possible. Uh but with three D_ uh curved uh remote controls  we must use rubber buttons. So we can't use the flat buttons. Yeah  I think. Um these kinda materials can be used. Yeah  I think so too. Yeah  scroll wheels um Yeah  that's good. We can use multiple scroll wheels  w if we want to. But I think just the volume is enough. And uh the L_C_D_. So we need uh the expensive  most expensive chip  if we use an L_C_D_. Okay  then we we use m must use the second most expensive chip. So th so the regular chip. Because we use scroll wheels. And um Yeah  that was it I guess. Uh are are we using a a rubber case  or We haven't decided yet. L Yeah  i it it should be soft. You said so? So just hard plastic? Okay. Titanium  uh I think it's too expensive. Yeah  you can make it curved or mm round. But just in two D_  not in depth. Yeah. Yeah th yeah  the chip is the the regular one. You have the simple one  regular and advanced. So it's b should be regular uh the second. I think I'll just check it. Yeah. Mm. Or should we do it in the next meeting? So we should did it here? Or should we do it in the next meeting? Okay. Yeah. What? Oh. Okay. Like a very big scroll-wheel. Okay. Hmm. I think uh you'll get a a lot of uh volume changing when it's not wanted. Yeah. I think it's probably better. Yeah  but maybe we can make a a plastic  so that you i if you like drop it  it won't change the volume. Only if you use your finger. I think in middle. Uh I think th the numbers should be in the bottom  and and the switch channel in the middle. Or you could do the switch channel up button above the the numbers and switch channel down button below. Yeah  okay. Uh but I think we we should bu uh put 'em on top of each other  so Because then it's it's easy to know m if I push the the the up Yeah  but the top the top button is is like you switch channel up  and down button is If you put them But uh but I I think uh left to right is more often associated with volume  and top down is more with uh channel changing. In uh On most on most remote controls. So so if we use that  they will probably have a long learning uh time. I dunno. Okay. Yeah  but i i it should be round in in shape. So No  tha that will be Yeah  so top down. Hmm? Do we have to design that w as well? The docking station? Hmm. Yeah  just a recharger. But we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well. Oh yeah  okay. Of the remote control? Yeah Yeah. Yeah  but we can we can do all kinds of uh As long as it isn is in two D_ we can use all kind of round shapes. Not in depth. Yeah  but Yeah  if if we want to make it kind of  yeah  new. Yeah  but we could do a lot of  lot more curving. I would do it Like in this kind of shape or I dunno. I dunno if it's handy. This? The olden the olden ones had looked like just a square thing. Mm. Yeah. Yeah  okay. Yeah. Yeah  I don't know. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah  though that's a trend. If we want to make it. But yeah  I'm not a Trendwatcher  you are. So Spongeball kinda. Okay. Yeah  I d I don't know n something about ergonomic kind of fits-in-the-hand uh stuff. Yeah  but we're we're aiming at a young public. Hmm. Yeah  we could do that. Yeah. S Uh yeah  I don't know. Yeah  I think so. And we we have to build in a microphone and Yeah  and I do I don't know anything about that. I d I didn't receive any information on speech recognition  so Fine. Yeah  we probably do. No. Yeah  uh I have I have some some information about the cost. But just a about the chip. I don't know how much  but Just in inexpensive or But i it's a separate chip. Yeah  I don't know anything about this  but Nah. I dunno. It's It won't wake up. Yeah. I was a bit early. Like What? No  I just came in. Uh normally I was one of them. Come on. Why won't it wake up? Is it on? But how? Ah  there it is. Uh. Yeah  I received an email as well. Which one was mine? The minutes. No  just tell us. Yes. Hmm. Yeah  more. Well  I'll I'll get back on it. Spongy. Spongy  like sponge. Uh soft materials. Yeah  but Yeah. Soft  sponge. Yeah  but Yeah. How are you gonna make it? Yeah. Yeah  I'll get back on that. Well  I got f also an email from the the technology department. They have done uh research about it  and uh even more possibilities now with speech. So they recommended using it. Well I'll check what they exact mean. So uh Yeah  th that's the only problem. I d They don't say how much it will cost  so Um but uh if we implement uh speech recognition  I think it would be better to implement L_C_D_ as well. Since you have to uh configure speech thing. Yeah  that's that's something I dunno. Yeah  so uh we gotta de We have to decide on that. Mm uh L_D_C_ doesn't require Okay. And speech recognition? Advanced. Yeah. I'll I'll give you my design. Yeah okay. So we Well we can I had uh to make a sort of a design. So I did some searching on the internet. I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls. I think we should um This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment. I think we should go more to the iPod and M_P_ three players. Mobile phones. More modern. Y yes. Um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller. 'Cause remote con control  you can see it here  you have to bo reach both out both sides. And here you just have one  few buttons. So that's that's the main difference. But looks uh I definitely think we should go like this. And then changeable fonts  so It's the most important part  I think. But And the home base is something like that  something simple. Well and then I just ordered the the buttons a bit. Uh basic buttons. On-off  mute. And th maybe two others  I dunno. Text buttons. Yeah  text button  maybe there and there. And then the colour buttons  if we want it on. I don't find it very usable  but it's Uh I don't think it's fits in the the modern theme as well. So and then yeah we saw the the pla display  in the the iPod. They can put the basic buttons  one  two  three  four. And uh f above ten. And I think No no. That th there is no display there. But it's on the place of the display. And I think we should uh light this up much more than that part. So the focus is on these two parts. So you don't see all the buttons you else need. Uh well um This is how it is now. Um Here uh Well we have volume. Yeah. Well here we have also side scrolls. I dunno if we can use that. Do we want to use For volume? Well then we can even simplify it more. By just putting the volume on the side. And and just channel buttons here. But I think uh Well. Yeah  well it's Basically it's it's here. They're on top? You mean uh these to the low? Oh okay. Well  yeah. Mm Maybe. I dunno  but yeah we'll Yeah  maybe it's not easy if it's below. It's harder to zap. So I think uh it should be should be easy to. I think it's pretty standard  these rubber buttons on the top. And uh if you don't light 'em up  they don't uh you don't see 'em very good. I think it's modern to light this area up  and to light this area up. So the focus gets on these parts and not on there. But uh the position of course can be different. It's s We have to look uh what's easy to use  and how it's easier to use. So we can uh switch these to I dunno if it l will look good  if you put those on t on the bottom half. Okay. Yeah  maybe Those two  yeah. And uh  yeah  you have to make sure it's easy to uh Yes  it has to be big enough so you can hold it  right. Well that's that's my findings. So uh my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look. M_P_ three player. And uh well um if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something  we I don't think we should put it on top then. I think that  if we're gonna put in more technology  that you need to be able to uh switch it open. To use So if you put in uh speech recognition  you need so more uh many more buttons. Which won't look good on the front side I think. So that's something we have to decide on. Yeah. What we're gonna do. Okay. Yeah well uh iPod is trendy. And it is well curved square. Okay. So not Yeah okay. Not uh the old uh box look. Mm Yeah  it's Black yellow control. Yeah  but uh I don't think the the colours black and yellow go well together. But Yeah  okay. Uh can't we use um different uh fron uh fronts  with all with the the logo on it? Can we do that? So Yes. So Yeah. But with all with logo on it. Yeah. Well one of the options. You can Just like a mobile phone  you can make um different fronts on it. So you can just replace them I think. That was the idea  or just uh release one. Yeah  uh Or just uh sell different ones. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  I uh I dunno. A more Yeah  just uh I think uh rubber really has an odd look. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  like mobile phones. Like uh the iPod. Uh just I dunno what uh kind of material it is. But Oops. Yeah. Yeah. Uh you can just make them around the buttons uh Yeah. Or it runs the whole Yeah  you can halfs transparent  or just that it's comes out a bit. Different  I think  also. Blue or red. Whatever you want it  I think. Uh depends on the colour of the Yeah  that's true. But Yeah  it can. 'Cause this a mo mib uh mobile phone as well. I have the mo mi I have a blinking light on my phone. And I can change the colour of it. Well  we don't put put in any fancier technology yet. So I'm sure we can fit in. Yeah. Yeah okay. We just Yeah  we have to make sure to uh Yes. Yes. Re recharger. Base station. Yeah  batteries. Yes  rechargeable batteries  I think's best. So if you hold it  it gets powered. Mm. So we need uh two D_. Yeah. Yeah. Uh For channels it's not handy  because you scroll too fast. Okay. Uh I don't think a rubber case looks Yeah  okay. That Uh fruit and veg  or Yeah  fruit and veg can be just the covers. So you can the the spongy yeah  I dunno. I can't imagine a soft remote control. I just can't imagine it. Yeah  I think. Titanium. It's mentioned here uh. Okay. Yeah. We have batteries. Regular. Yes. User interface concept. I dunno either. Uh I_D_ and U_I_D_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board. So we're staying here? Okay  so now we're ka thirty minutes alone again? Yeah  uh I dunno. But the iPod and etcetera  M_P_ three players  mobile phones. Just a bit cur Okay  I'll see if I can see any of those. Yeah  you Yeah. Yeah  that's a little problem  of course  as well. Yeah  maybe you just have to make it uh That's not scrollable too easy. Uh wh what is the middle part? Numbers  okay. Yeah  I agree as well. Use the dz Yeah  that's right. Yeah  I think uh zapping is the highest priority. And then you use those uh Yeah  of course uh. Yeah. I I think it's It's it's obvious  I think. Yeah  I think No  uh I think Yeah. I think it's s so simple you just Yeah  okay I'll d I'll take a look at it. Think we need to work uh thirty minutes again? No  you have uh It is Uh the current uh controllers are all black and plastic. You have to look at that image of the iPod. More that uh kind of style. Not not the old grey black Where you can put a ve Uh we have If we do it like that we have below have we uh a lot of room to put a nice logo. Maybe you can buy separate ones and uh Yeah. Um I think Yeah. That's your choice  I think huh. Yes. Yeah  I think so. But th Yeah  that can be very simple. Least. Yeah  just where you're around something. Li Yeah  we had one example. Mm. Mm. Which w Here you see one that's very round. So I think that can be all kind of shapes. Yeah  so y you don't want uh this uh like the iPod. But More rounded. Yeah  I think it will just look like more like this one. Since it's This is also rounded. I think i Yeah okay  tho those are al already a bit cornered. Mm Yeah okay  but then we have to think of something totally new. I've uh I had a lot of picture of old ones. And all curves have already been done. Yeah okay  yeah well Yeah. I know we can do a lot more  but I think it will only look more like the old remote controls. Yeah. Yeah okay. But uh I had a lot of pictures Oh I can show you here what the old ones look like. Curves  curves. You've more there as well. It wasn't very small one. very simple. That is for elderly. I think if w My opinion. If we just uh take the iPod  and the same look. So uh light or just whatever colour  but the same light colours. And uh just with uh together with uh the back-lights b look will look very new. No rubber buttons or something. Just together with the back-lights you'll get a totally new look. More like the M_P_ three player M_ um P_ M_ P_ three player. Yes. Just a simple scrollb Doesn't have to be. Yeah. No. Spongy and Mm. Yeah  idea. But you're If you look at the way remote controls are now And if you make it look like the iPod Yeah okay. So that's already a very big change compared to Ye yeah. Well uh Could. No  I think Oh. Think the scroll wheel won't be very big. Since if you put it uh somewhere  the chances that it will scroll are too big. So it will just be a small small scroll wheel. So it won't uh stick out much. Yeah okay. Well  maybe we can just open images there  and I'll paint and paint. I'll be able to do a better job. Bu Yeah  I agree more like iPod. Yes. Just a Speech. Yeah  do we s keep that? Yeah  I think Well uh then it w Well that's very easy. We already have uh the beeping of the home station  so Uh strange that I received the information about that. So shall we it open then? So we can put all the Okay. Yeah. Oh yeah  I No. I just I just received the Yeah. Yeah  our division has developed a new speech recognition feature  the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit. This is a very small electronic unit  will give a standard answer after it recognise a question. Doesn't say. Just You say record  followed by your question sample  and after a few seconds the answer uh sample. Because uh So it works like uh good morning remote control  and then the remote control says good morning. Yeah uh th that's just It's a No. Yeah  it Well that's integrated in the chip  so if you use the speech recognition  that's in it. I dunno  but if we use speech recognition  that will be in it as well. Well it it would be would be a good feature feature. Okay. No no worries about the cost  etcetera. And there's a chip in it that will Okay. ,The project manager opens the meeting by going over the agenda. She explains the project  which is to create a new remote control for television that should be original  trendy  and user-friendly. The three components of completing the project will be functional  conceptual  and detailed design. They introduce themselves by going up to the white board and stating their name  role  drawing their favorite animal  and sharing their favorite characteristic about the animal. After they talk about their overall budget  they discuss what special features they want to include in this remote control that existing ones do not have. They discuss making a menu-based remote which would be less crowded with buttons and therefore stylish and sleek but functional. They end the meeting with the project manager going over the task each member is to complete before the next meeting. 
Hi Kate. Okay  carry on. Alright um this is the beginning of the third meeting  the conceptual design meeting. Um our agenda should be um that we're opening the meeting  I have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared f drive at this point. Um and we should each have a presentation to make. Um we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total. It's twenty five after two at the moment  so forty minutes is five after three  um which I'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us. Okay. Um there are the decisions we have to turn to  but we'll come back to them in a minute after I take us to the minutes of the previous meeting. Right um as we remember  I opened the meeting  the four of us were present  the meeting the first meeting's minutes were reviewed and approved. Um Sarah  you presented a marketing research report um which pretty much rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds uh it has to be hand-held  power  channel  volume  number keys  possibly a speech recognition. And then Steph did a second presentation um that those functions plus streamlining them with big user-friendly keys that were easy to use. I think all of us agreed with those things. Kate presented a working design of going after going over the basics on the whiteboard um that it should be a simple mass-produced device  because of the twelve and a half Pence cost. Um but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place as a selling point. Um and the new requirements that it for be for T_V_ only um and that it include the l so slogan and colour of the uh corporate design be included. Um the corporate image. So we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense  that were decision makers. Alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the T_V_  but it still should meet those parameters. Um and that the function we agreed was volume  power  numbers  enter  channels  a way to move between channels  easy to use and hand-held. Um at that point we agreed that Sarah would look at the current cost of competition  what what do the current ones sell for. Um and Steph was gonna look at ec ergonomics. Kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed. And I was to type up these minutes and work on the final report. Is this a fair presentation of what our last meeting was? Okay. Right. So we're ready to close that and go back to our That one. Right. We're up to the point of the Go back. Um the three presentations. So we're going to pull the plug on me and turn to Sarah. Is that okay? Is that alright with everybody else? Especially since Kate asked to be last. Sarah  I'm sorry if I misspelled your name  I didn't know whether it was S_A_R_A_ or S_A_R_H_. You respond to whatever you get  huh? Okay. Um  did you do your Hit Ah  there it is. Ta-da. Mm 'kay. 'Kay. Mm. It sounds like the the uh covers that they use for the remote  you know  your t your cell phone. Mm. Hmm. Uh-huh mm. In most families  don't isn't the remote is a remote. Mm. Mm. Well actually some households do have three and four T_V_s and they would have a remote for each one  so. Hmm. Hmm. Are we talking about the device itself or the c or a cover for the device that would be an interchangeable cov cover as a separate product? Perhaps perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management and perhaps go to another group to actually design as a separate product. Wo would that be agreeable? Do you wanna be next or you want Kate to go next? Okay  we'll move the Mm. Mm. Alright. Remember  we only have forty minutes Hmm. Mm. Hmm. Hmm. Thank you  Kate. Yes. There we go. Do it again. Keep doing it until you get it in both you get it there  you get it yours without that one  and then you get it with both. Yeah. This time it should come up both. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm. Hmm. Mm. Huh. It's a selection wheel. Okay. Okay. Or call it a or call it a banana and have it in yellow. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Mm 'kay. I wanna thank you all for all your presentations. We have about ten minutes left  in which time we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts. Um and I think you all have been self-stimulating of working together. Um we need to come up with some specifics of the components  um the materials  things like making the decision on the energy um and the case and the interface type things. So let's Mm. Right. They want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use  which the choices that we've discussed were pretty much battery  kinetic or solar. Um this is where Kate's expertise comes in  and our decision making will be a little bit guided by Kate at this point. The You were saying that the kinetic would be useful  that is you just have to move it some and you'd be able to use it um as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or um keep replacing the batteries. Um or solar that you'd have difficulty with it if it's a dark day  that it'll die on you  and no way to do it. That's the day you wanna use the T_V_. Um so what's our pleasure here  what would be the cost consequences of each of the three? Okay. Mm 'kay. What's the uh feelings of the group on the kinetic? Hmm. Hmm. So the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's at all possible. It costs. Mm. Mm. Mm. Hmm. Yeah. Thanks for the reminder for five minutes to finish  thanks. Um the next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as a decision. Oh. Okay. What about the ca yeah. Oh  the way we uh-huh. Oh  okay. Um what about the case? I think they're talking there about do we want wood  plastic  titanium or rubber  and I think we've discussed not having titanium. One  it's too expensive  um and second  it won't do this double um curves. Um we've sort of eliminated wood. We said plastic or rubber. What's the pleasure? What about you? Cover. Uh-huh. Plastic inside. Hmm. Okay. Um the next part they want is the user interface concept. I'm sorry to push you  but we only have a couple minutes to finish with. Okay  and it says interface. What type and what supplements? Okay  um that's that. Um this is gonna sound weird  but the next meeting starts in thirty minutes. Whew. And they actually want a look and feel design  user interface design  you can look and see this as well as I can. Marketing they want product evaluation. Oh. Oh my  I'm sorry. Oh  okay. Sorry about that. missed that one. This ought to be fun trying to get this thing to work. Ah  ta-da. Ah. Yes  because I can't even see mine. Next meeting starts in thirty minutes  these are the individual actions. Yeah  right. Um the look and feel design is for Kate  uh Steph gets the user interface design  you get product evaluation. Um the two of you get to play with a Pla modelling clay um to do a prototype. Uh and everybody gets individual instructions in the usual way. Anything else we need to do? Go to it. And that's the end of this meeting. That's for her benefit. I respond to either. No worries. Okay  first thing I want to address is um one of the points that Florence brought up  which was uh current cost of the competition devices  similar to the ones that Stephanie uh showed us and and they're uh twenty to sixty Euros  depending on uh branding. Some of them that have a higher brand recognition are on the more expensive end. But I think that with the current um price that we're searching for  we're well within  even on the lower end  of the uh of the market. But I'm going to move on to more interesting um more vibrant things. So  I investigated the remote control market in greater detail  and my uh the theme of what I was to work on was uh trend watch. And I know that you all are a distance from cutting edge marketing research  so you know  I'm just gonna try to cloak it in really professional terms here. What's hot  fruit and veg. Spongy. And this is all over the catwalks  Paris  Milan  and I'm talking about clothing  furniture  shoes. This is really interesting change from past years  because it is much more organic  um some would say approachable. And I think if we're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control  we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset. So. I also did a little research on um what again are the most important priorities in uh decision making about uh purchasing. Fancy. Functional is out. And f the fancy  and that's exactly the term  I'm I'm thinking polished  elegant  you know  kind of innovative  but a cut above. This is twice as important as the next finding  which is technologically innovative. This is interesting  'cause I think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important  but maybe what's innovative is having it simple with um with uh technologically superior fabrics or uh  you know  designed in interesting substances. Ease of use. Again  pretty low  I mean it's the top three  but each of the uh fancy and technologically innovative are far more important. So I think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of fruit fruit themed sleeves. Y yeah  you know Exactly. Exactly. I was thinking though that instead of having something uh like patterned  you know  so  you know  something similar to a summer dress. you know  it would have like fruit and veg  is that we actually make these spongy. They could be ini initially I thought we could start with kind of um fruit that would suit kind of uh a long uh hand-held  so banana  pineapple and pear. Um it could actually the sleeve could take up a lot of the development and the remote control  we'd just need to get reductionist on it. They could be interchangeable  they're spongy  that goes back to ergonomic  and the youngsters love 'em  fun for the whole family  everyone can have their own. So what we're talking about is changing. this concept. Everyone has a T_V_ remote  but then we add in the fact that they could each have their own individual fruit. That's what's hot on the catwalks. So  this is my This is what I'm thinking. Y yeah  but I think I think what this would allow is perhaps a person in the family who had the most opinion about it we all need a remote  but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising  I'm thinking the teenager  the someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers. Yeah. W and plus I think Uh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So this is an idea and I I you know  this is exactly what the research has uh has shown. So I really open this up to uh any other feedback. This spongy fruit and veg. Thanks. Alright. I I just have my ear to the market  guys. Is spongiest  yeah. That would add Mm-hmm. They are and they they would fulfil the uh first um priority  which is fancy. I think many of us would associate those with fancy. Something else we could do is uh call it something that's fruit and veg oriented. We could call it uh The name. Well it would be uh a a very simple product that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable. So That  you know  that might be And then we could keep it titanium. Yeah. Or s or smelly. Scratchy Uh well I was really thinking a lot about the I_ uh the iMac kind of gel gem tone. It's hot on the streets  guys. Mm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Mm. That sounds good. Any idea you you mentioned that there would be a cost difference. Um do you have any idea if if this could if the fancy model could be done in twelve Euros fifty? Hmm. Because  you know what  I'm being quite serious when I say that that um the things I mentioned are hot. But I think the important thing might be to choose one. You know  if if what you're telling me is is um some of these things aren't just f aren't feasible  maybe we could something about naming  we could call it  you know  Blackberry. That's uh Alright  well let's see then. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah  I'm trying to streamline mine a little bit. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Mm. Thank you  Kate. Mm. Oh I think um Florence resolved it by F_ eight again. Maybe. Mm. Hmm. It's a duplication. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. To uh m make it. Oh nice. Um Hmm. Mm. Wow. Do you think with um It seems that that uh you guys are quite keen on the plastic  perhaps the something reminiscent of the child's remote. Do you think we could put it in a in a fruit colour? And have it abstract. You know  we could call like a fruit name  but it would be a little more abstract. Mm-hmm. I'm just just throwing out ideas. Yeah. I'm thinking maybe we need to be a little bit more abstract if the design constraints are so Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Nice. Good point. I've used kinetic in terms of watches and it's very very uh handy  you don't even notice um that it's there. It's Mm-hmm. It could tie in with the fanciful design as uh  you know  throw the banana  you know  just gotta keep it moving. Be Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. But I could market that as a um as a a I was thinking actually a a cost saver down the road  in terms of battery  you know. Mm-hmm. You know  kind of the That's exactly what I was thinking. I'm sold. Mm. Kind of like an internal egg. Yeah. And with sports on television. You know. I su Then I'll just say I support either from a marketing point of view I support either decision that the designers make on that. No we can't  actually. That's why I was looking over your shoulder Mm. Sounds good. That's really all I got  guys. Yeah. Yes. Yep. Yeah  Right. Yes. So when your dad's sitting there  overriding your decision  going no we're gonna watch this  you can bring out your own remote and be like zap  no we're gonna watch this. Yep. And as for as for um well budgeting as well  if we're gonna have lots of different interchangeable components. Is this to the market? I was thinking titanium  I was thinking it's just I have been influenced by pictures of iPods  and they're also minimalist and shiny. Yeah  but it's kind of pointless  isn't it? Yeah. Let's delegate. Yeah  maybe. Or I think possibly it might be more useful if Kate went next. Um You can even have them in different flavours as well. So that if you just wanna sit there and chew on the remote  it could be like pear flavour  yeah. Scratch and sniff. A wind-up. Bear bear in mind it has to be the colours and styles of the company  so what I had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it. But um I I don't know how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the Real Reaction company. It's just what I'd understood we'd be doing. That's before I heard about all this hot tips about the future  fruit-wise. Shall we wait 'til I've 'til I've showed you what well  my extensive presentation on what sort of interfaces are available. You did seem to include just in more detail what I've got though. So so mine's a bit pointless. Right. F_N_ and F_ eight  did you say? I don't have it on mine though. Should I do it again? Right then. I don't actually have a huge amount of different information then what Kate says  just that my method was to look at the  well  my my inspirations  which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing  including M_P_ three players  uh like you know  hi-fi remotes  not just television and these things. Uh having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones  um what functions we actually need  and then how to group and arrange these on the actual the actual plastic or rubber hand-held piece. Uh I've been especially interested in the iPod style scroll wheel  which Well  I couldn't find a the picture of the iPod w only linked to a web browser  so I couldn't copy and paste it  but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right. It has uh scroll wheels without without a display  but they they scroll like a computer mouse. So I was thinking that uh um a really simple a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it um and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen. Like I guess an existing Sky or cable one does. Like  you know  you press enter and it comes up with what's showing on that channel at the moment  and you can do you can scroll along and it'll show you what's on in the next half hour  and you scroll up and you can see what's on the other channels while you're watching the same channel on the screen. Uh but I'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote  um which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice  big  easy buttons to press  but still quite simple and quite cost effective. So what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple  uh not fancy but not totally minimalist  I mean just pretty simple plastic  probably  I was thinking  yellow and black  just because that's the company's colours  with very very few buttons  but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen  like  you know  just small along the bottom instead of instead of having the iPod style display screen on the actual remotes  which is far too expensive. And when you've got a screen sitting there in front of you  you might as well have it appearing uh on the screen in front of you  it doesn't obscure much of the actual picture you're watching. And so on that you can  just much in the same way as an existing Sky remote  scroll along  scroll up and down. And uh and I definitely support uh the use of plastic and or rubber. I mean titanium would be great  but I think it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey. If we're k trying to keep it colourful and slightly organic  then I think titanium's too futuristic. Yeah. Whereas a plastic's so cheap and easy and mouldable and everything else. Uh then And it's a little bit pointless as well I think. Like when when when you've got when you've got the screen there  it doesn't have to be anything fancy  just a little menu showing yeah  a menu  you go into one menu and then it can have your different options  whether you wanna change the settings or the you know  your information about programme that's on at the moment. I don't think that's to taxing to uh s engineer. Um. But as for actually arranging them let me go back to the to the picture of the kiddie one. And I quite like it  'cause it's just smooth and hand-held and it's got these easily reachable buttons that quite nicely uh spaced out  so something a bit like that with buttons arranged in a kind of circle. Up  down  left  right. I I was thinking not actually scroll  like a like mouse scroll  but you know  a I can't quite d uh describe it. you see on the one on the right  down at the bottom  is the mouse. Yeah  see where the mouse is  like this s style thing where you c have up  down  left and right. And enter in the middle  so you pick your menu and then your different options and when when you click on each one  it you can go into a new menu for that. I'm getting a bit uh specific here. Really we'd have to use something to show you  but If I don't think I can get it up on the screen. Ah here we go. Right. Well  the iPod spinning wheel is uh really complicated. It does scroll  but it is hugely complicated. What else have we got? Them  they're terrible. But they all have this this feature of this uh It's not quite a scroll wheel  but it's a kind of selection in this circle  which I think is a really good idea. Yeah  like up  down  left and right. Which is good. And then and then Yeah  so I mean either a channel up and down  volume up and down  next appearing programmes up and down  uh and then also when you get into the different menus on the screen  it's got your things like settings and contrast up and down. So all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle. And that's it. Look at look at this one. Almost impossible to misplace or l or lose. Might take up your whole living room. Possibly. Yeah. That also is possible. Just Uh just something else I need to bring to your attention is have you have you seen these on a remote? This is actually the volume up and down  but they both say V_ on them  which  when you first look at it  you expect that to be the down  because it looks like a downward pointing arrow  but it's actually the V_ to indicate that it's the volume  so uh we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these. But we wouldn't have a specific volume up and down. If we're having the scroll wheel  then it's gonna double up as all the other up and down functions. But then  that's complicated. It sounds great. I've never come across it before  but it sounds fantastic. Sounds like it could be g a really good economical it would make the whole thing a lot lighter  more convenient. Yeah. 'Cause it's really a quite attractive thought  isn't it? It's like yeah  a good selling point. But it does depend how much I mean how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs. Do your exercises while you're watching the T_V_. Yeah  that's what I was thinking as well. Do you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside  and then a kind of spongy Yeah  s thick spongy cover  so it feels like the whole thing's spongy  but actually you're not damaging anything by squeezing it. Because I mean you could just get carried away with the with the tac Yeah. Well you do get a bit carried away with things that are tactile  you just wanna stroke them and squeeze them  and Just copy the one on the left. No um a scroll Well  like four buttons  up  down  left and right with enter in the middle  that will correspond to a menu on the screen. Yeah  I'd like push buttons with So push buttons No  it's still it's still plugged in on mine actually. Now it's gone again. Oh yes. Great. I don't think so. Play-Doh. Just just carry on. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Sorry. I'm glad to see the marketing budget is being so well spent on. I think that's a good idea. Don't you? Yeah  I I think we're gonna have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this. Spongy is gonna be difficult  I'm afraid. Yeah  I mean basically we can make these things out of wood  titanium  plastic or rubber. I suppose rubber is the closest to spongy  yeah. I was thinking titanium myself. Yeah. W w would it be helpful if um I described the components a bit  because I think it would give you um maybe bring this discussion back to Earth of what we can actually physically do. Right  well I I I think some of this um you're gonna be a little disappointed with some of the things I have to tell you  but I'm afraid this is the real world. So um I've been looking at the the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate  and I've had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division  who have told me what's actually available  you know  what the current state of the art in components is  and some of the exciting new things they've got  but I'm not sure that it's quite what you want um. Now this isn't a very good overhead  but this is just to show you  this is the innards of a remote control um. I really need a pen or something but uh does my mouse work? No. Um oh yeah  can you see my little mouse pointer? Right. This is this is the a a a remote that's been opened up and that's the the back of the interface. And this is a push-button one  so you see these little little buttons here  they're little rubber rubber buttons that go through onto the the board at the back and they push these buttons here. Um and we that's the basic construction that we've got to got to accommodate. We got to have something that pushes the little buttons that um talk to the chip that encodes the message that sends the the message to the receiver. So um I wan I wanna go through not not just addressing the um uh the the points that you made  Sarah  but um doing my presentation in the order I wrote it. So first of all um I wanna talk about what possibilities we've got for the energy source. Um we can have your bog standard double double A_ batteries in a replaceable um little compartment. We can have a hand sorry a wind-up  yeah  which I think is quite an interesting concept for a sorry for a remote control  but i it maybe is doesn't quite go with the um the fruit and veg. Um one that one that I think is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source  where um you you actually get the energy by moving the device  which is quite a ni a nice and neat one. You have to it means that if it's sitting there for a long time it probably won't work  but you have to sort of throw it between your hands every now and then  it'll work. Or we we had talked about solar power  but I thing that we agreed that that's not so good in the dark. Now I'm afraid this is the options we've got on on the case. It can be made of plastic  rubber  wood o if you like  or titanium. Um and the nearest we've got to st to spongy there I guess is rubber  but um I'm gonna come back to the advantages of titanium  and basically it can have a flat surface  a curved surface or a double curved surface  but I think if we wanna use standard components  we're gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that. Okay  what does the interface look like? Um well push button  that's that's the one we're all familiar with. Um we can have scroll buttons and the the scroll button can incorporate a push  so you can have it like on a mouse where you can use it to go up and down  change volume or channel or something like that and push to select something. Um you can have multiple scroll buttons  um this is maybe getting a little bit complicated  but um it's it the technology is there. And we can also incorporate an L_C_D_ display in the remote  but this will increase the cost. Um the electronics that actually makes the device work  we've basically got three  simple  regular  advanced  and the price goes up as we choose each of this. If we want the nice cheap one  the simple  then we can only have push buttons. All the other fancy interface designs go out the window  I'm afraid. Um pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons. If you want the advanced chip it obviously costs more  but it that's what you need if you want the L_C_D_ display. And the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed um sample sensor sample speaker devices. Now I don't know what that is  but I think they think it's quite important and we might want to incorporate it somewhere. Um ou our real expertise is in push buttons  I have to say  but maybe you think that's old technology. And well I I think we've got two options. We can either go for a really cheap model  keep all of the costs down  um which means a flat plastic case with an ordinary battery and simple push buttons. Or we can have something that looks a bit nicer  I think it  um won't necessarily l uh look like a pineapple  but um that may or may not be a good thing. Sorry. Um but it could have an L_C_D_ screen and it could have multiple scroll buttons  and it could have the the company's new development of the um sample sensor and speaker. So  thank you. Yeah  I'm afraid I don't have that information available. Um manufacturing didn't actually give attach any prices to any of this  I'm afraid. Yeah mm-hmm. Banana? We we could we could do um a double curved rubber one  which would allow um say a banana  but um unfortunately I see from my notes that if we do that  we have to have a push button as the interface  we can't do anything fancier. Yep. I If you do F_ uh F_N_ F_ eight again  it's it'll I think it yeah  you you will do an Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah  I'd I'd certainly support that idea. It's difficult to make fancy shapes in it as well  we can't for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately. And the the having the the the screen on the television screen I think is a good idea  'cause um otherwise we're we're putting up the price not only for putting building the L_C_D_ in  but for the electronics as well. There is that. Do you want scroll buttons in that as well? Mm-hmm. Right. Yeah. I think I think that's a g nice clean design  it's playing to our strengths which are in push button technology. Yeah. But we can implement it with simple push buttons  which is much cheaper. In fact Oh that's really nice. Hmm. Mm. We we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you'd rather if you feel if you like the spongy Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Oh unfortunately I don't have costing information. I i in terms of workability  I I think the the two front-runners are the standard battery or the kinetic  but I'm sorry I don't figures on the difference in cost. And and how much you do have to keep it moving  'cause I'm conscious that watching T_V_ can be quite a sed sedentary activity. Yeah. True  yeah  m more more environmentally friendly. Oh right  okay  I'd that that's something I maybe should have covered. Um chip on print is just a manufacturing technique um and I would certainly recommend it  I think  because I'm not sure I have an alternative. I i it it's just the way that the the the uh th the way it's ac it's actually built and you you print onto the circuit board like you might print onto paper. Well if if Sarah's keen on a spongy feel  the the rubber that we're talking about is the same as you have in those little stress balls  so it's yeah. Yeah. I'd I'd need to talk to manufacturing again about whether that's actually possible  but I agree  it's uh sounds like a nice idea if it is. I should I should r Which I think technically is just push button and uh I'd certainly support that that that brings the cost down quite a lot and it's something that we're an ex the company's an expert on. You know  I think the the company's s next project should to design a better overhead device that switches immediately. ,The meeting opens with the group doing introductions by giving their name and role. Betty is the project manager  Francina is the user interface specialist  Eileen is the marketing expert  and Jeanne is the industrial designer. The project manager tells them they will be designing a new remote control that should be original  trendy  and user-friendly. They will be concerned with functional  conceptional  and detailed design. To try out the whiteboard  each group member draws her favorite animal on the board. They discuss the project budget and then talk about their experiences with remote controls. They seemed to agree that the remote should be compact and have a multi-purpose functions. They also agree that it should do something different that current controls cannot do and that it should be made of different colors  materials  and shapes. They also discuss a way of helping people find the remote when it is lost- a signal  whether it is a beep or light. Then they close the meeting with the project manager going over the tasks they are to complete and telling them they will meet again in about thirty minutes. 
Hello. Yeah. That's the kind of spam that everybody likes to receive. Hmm. Do you have any preference uh of order? I think she is still finishing her. Hmm. Okay  it's uh Is it like a crank thing or something. Well  there's sometimes combinations  I mean  like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power. Uh I think  it has to be on the on the solar energy  but I don't know. Let's have a squeezable remote. If it's rubber  isn't it malleable anyway  it doesn't matter if it's double I mean isn't a rubber case  mean it's completely flexed  I mean  it it flexes to whatever they want it to? Mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double rubber double curved case? Okay. Okay. Go rubber. Go rubber the whole way. I think push-buttons is Yeah. Th the the speech recognition um option is it doesn't seem really very promising for us uh  'cause uh The yeah the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine  where  basically  you can program a sample wi um That when you say something it will give a response  and you program the response as well. Just uh clips of tha that you record yourself. So you can program your coffee-maker that when you say  good morning  to it it says  hello Rick  or whatever. But  I mean  it's not it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the T_V_ on like  turn the T_V_ on  and i turns comes on  but it's not that. It just gives you a it just gives you a verbal response. So  yeah  I mean  like what's the point of saying  Hello remote  I mean  hello  how how are you? Yeah  if you're really lonely  it is it's No  tha that w that w that would be more promising. It it's just a remote that talks to you. Uh. I mean to certain cues. 'Kay. Yeah  I'm fine with the basic battery. Hmm. Yeah  so we want it rub rubber double curved. So rubber rubber keys  yeah. Yeah.. Yeah. We're giving them a way to burn off steam  basically  yeah. Not that watching T_V_ should be that stressful. Oh yeah  I guess T_V_ can be stressful  yeah  if you're watching sports. Alright. Alright. Yeah  some of what I have to say ties into what Catherine was just talking about. Okay  so I'm continuing with the user interface uh topic. And so basically I consulted with our manufacturing division. It sounded like Catherine was also speaking with them. Uh I also took uh Reissa's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration um  'cause I think that's that's crucial as far as uh what keys we're going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and and how they're laid out. Uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products  uh like the coffee machine. So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface. I guess  we we basically vetoed that idea. It's it's pointless. Uh it's just a sample sensor sample output. It would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the T_V_. Uh so yeah  they they also give the uh they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an M_P_ three player like iPod. Um so we've already addressed that and I think that would actually be worse for something like R_S_I_ I mean you got that thumb movement that you're constantly doing. Um the other suggestion  and I I have a feeling that we're interested in in something more general  but they suggested uh  you know  going i a little bit into a a niche  like either gearing our remote towards kids  where you could have lot of colours um  the keys might be you know  funny or or  or uh something for the elderly  where the remote's very large and the buttons are very large and there's only a few buttons. But you know we can we can discuss this  but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general  but done well. Uh um So  the key layout and design are really crucial. You don't want uh you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without uh always pressing the wrong one um. And I didn't mention that we need a power button in our last I can give you an example here of uh  good layout and bad layout uh from our manufacturing department. So this would be an example of bad layout  where you have volume up and volume down  but they have a V_ on both of them  so uh it's sort of confusing for the user. Uh this is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose. And for something for kids. Yeah. Um. And so  yeah  I th I think my personal preferences of we've all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page um. Uh so I was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense. I think it should be more general. I didn't I didn't think the spinning-wheel or the uh L_C_ display were were crucial for us. And  yeah  that's it for me. So we're we're not gonna have any sort of display I think uh. So  yeah  it's just gonna be just gonna be push-buttons. Um. I think we shall have a limited number of buttons  ideally  I mean a a power  channel up  channel down  volume up  volume down  and a numerical keypad. Uh. And some sort of it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that. I guess it's to the point where we need to decide about that. Well now that we've decided on our Um it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy  but um Yeah  I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere  like maybe the R_R_ can be yellow  or something like that. I I guess the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before. I mean  'cause uh s so if we wanna have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button. But I think that should be I mean um  I can speak with the button department  but uh I think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents prevents the other uh the other buttons from operating. So that should be simple. Mm. Yeah. Well it should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense  I mean have something that's little more technologically advanced than what's on the market. Yeah. Yeah. Actually  I mean  these first two points we've already sort of gone away from  'cause our rubber one is not fancy I mean it's different  but I wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy. If that's what people want then we maybe we're going in the wrong direction. And it's it's not technologically innovative either. Mm. So is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other electronics? Yeah  that's basically what it allows you to do  right? Yeah  the that wouldn't be the remote so much  I mean Mm. Yes  so can Yeah  we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating like the energy generator. we're all about that. Okay  so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them.. Yeah  that's great for us. Right. Yeah. Yeah  that's great. Yeah  I don't know how we incorporate We don't have to follow every trend  I guess. Uh-huh. The power button could be like a big apple or something. They don they don't own all images of apples. Okay  we'll make it a uh pomegranate  a big pomegranate.. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Sure. The one thing I'm wondering about  I hope that we're not going like too much down a gimmicky road of of having I mean if somebody go goes into the store they're gonna see like three or four normal remotes  and then a big spongy pink t tomato uh remote. I mean what are ninety per cent of people gonna take? Mm. Yeah I mean  that that seems to work well with for products like iPod  where  you know  you have a variety of colours  that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it  even  you know  just just by the fact of choosing. Right. Yeah. Okay. Oh right. Yeah. That sounds good. Mm. Right. Alright. Yeah. Yeah. Mm  I think we all know what we need to do now. Okay. Okay  I'll stay in here. Does the pay-raise immediately come into effect on our next pay-check  or is that So we're buying fut I mean  we're getting futures in the company. So we really have a incentive to make this remote work. I'd like to share in the coffee machine profits  because that's really doing well. Yeah.. This company has its its fingers in a lot of different pots. Yeah  we're definitely not in the money making department. Well I I did notice looking at I mean  they told you that they wanted whatev our product to represent the the R_R_ brand and and to be immediately noticeable. I mean  if you look like at the coffee maker at the at the corporate web page  it's not obvious. R_R_. Well it is to us  because we we worked worked here for years and we use that coffee machine  but it's doesn't have the colour scheme of of the of the company anywhere on it obviously it's just sil silver and black. No. Mm. Okay. Right  well  I guess that's us. Okay. Right. Oh right okay. I cover myself up.. I've always wanted one of these  I really have. Where do you buy 'em from? They're. Yeah. Oh my gosh. Mm-hmm. Batteries. It's here. Ah. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Mm. I think rubber's But after my after my fashion thing  I think you'll realise that rubber is more People. What about the just developed uh sample sensor? G there  the sample sensor  sample speaker thing. Mm  I dunno. Be cool. Channel two. Oh  it just gives an answer. Oh  then then I thought I thought it was when they said I thought when they said  voice recognition  they meant um like  channel five  and it will change. Like you talk to it. Can I have channel five? Oh  then forget about it. Oh right okay. Mm. Mm. Yeah. So it will look like something like this.. Yeah. Well the rubber push-buttons. Don't you have to move your Mm. Mm. Yeah  the rubber's good. Yeah  so they can sit there and go like Mm. Mm. That does get annoying. Uh-huh. Well Maybe we can Right. Well  I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets and what the fashions are for next year. Um. So yes  so from looking at this year's trends and fashions and also recent investigation that we've done in the remote control market  we have found that for the remote control market these are like most important aspects like that we really need to which we've already probably discussed. Um the most important aspect is look and feel. So the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have. So it has to be Yep. Exactly. Um second  uh it should be technologically innovative innovative. So Technologically it should be like um work  basically  I guess. It should work. Should That's new. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. So  no loose That's why I was thinking  Bluetooth  'cause if you like put up Bluetooth  and it's like a Bluetooth remote control  everybody's gonna like  oh  'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays  like it really is  like people and um when it comes to marketing like that's what people go for  they don't really care whether  you know  at the end of the day whether it works properly or not. Well  they do  but it's like it's not Yeah  but it looks good. If it looks good and it's it can just be there for decoration. But like You could always insert  yeah. Yeah  but  I mean  people like Well  if you're looking at if you looking at something that's going to be bought by people  you have to make it new  you have to make it state of the art. Well  it doesn't Like it doesn't have to be  you know  Bluetooth  that was just an idea  but like it needs do something that  you know  is new. Whether it's a battery it could be something really really minor  you know  like but I think we are really keeping to what is already out there  and people've already seen it  people've already got it. If we want something new  we need to move away from what we already have and um just go creative. And then you can market it. Never have to change a battery again. I think  safety s Yeah. Third most important aspect uh is it's easy to use. And I think we've all um worked that out. Um okay  in the fashion  how it's supposed to look. Next year's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths  shoes and furniture. So next year people will be buying  I found this really funny  you know  strawberry shaped chairs  and things. Yeah. Rubber things. Um and as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy  so it's it's not quite spongy  but spongy  I would say is yeah  so we're in. Yeah. And so personal what I was just saying like move away from the current remote controls uh like the look and the feel of the current ones and change the look and feel  while still keeping to the company's image  basically. So yeah.. I had to say So we're moving in the right direction like Mm. Maybe make it like fruity colours or something. Some sort. Or Mm. Well I think  if it's rubber it needs to be different. I think  it's it should be I mean  what do you associate with rubber? You know like really different colours basically. Okay  sor I sorry  I used the wrong word  what do you associate with the mate the material that material? Um Um like I'm just thinking bright colours. Bright natural colours  nothing too Bright  but too not yeah. Like no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink. Wanna make it different colours so anybody can choo like like Yeah. And on the back of it have the logo. Well I can say in this country  you'll get  you know  lots of people wanting something really funky and cool. Like and kids will be walking in with their parents saying  Mummy I wanna buy that one. And uh parents will see the will see the pro as well  because it's um like kids won't break it  it's not breakable if you throw it around. Especially with younger kids  you know they can pick it up and and Yeah. The only thing is is that really small kids might chew on it  but Yeah. So so it's rea it's quite it's quite like um user friendly and also for different families  like like family use as well  so for little kids and for old ki like teenagers will like it  I think. Especially maybe younger girls if it's in pink they'll be like pink remote control for their room something. Yeah. So like you walk in  you're like  oh I like that remote control  because it's so bright  and then  and then the shop assistant comes up and says  oh what colour would you like? and then they go like  oh I can choose the colour wow. So it puts  I think  even the customer into more control over what they're buying instead of  you've got all colour it's either that or nothing. So they also get to pick. Well  personally I like walking into a shop and choosing a colour. It's um Yeah. Mm. D you've got the Evaluation. Mm. Yeah. S This gives you all the details? um. Yeah. Mm. Mm. . Almost. Mm 'kay. No no no no  it's fine I'm just preparing. Okay. Where is that thing? Oh sorry  couldn't see. Would that work? Okay  so that's me again. Um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery  a hand dynamo which is which was used uh in the fifties for torches  if you remember that kind of which wouldn't be v wouldn't be v v yeah  yeah. It wouldn't be very fancy. You can have a kinetic provision of energy  which is used on some watches these days. So if you have just a bit of gentle movement that it will give it the energy to work. Or you can use solar cells  but I'm not sure about that indoors  really  but Yeah. I dunno actually. I dunno. Um. Think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery  really. And uh if we want something fancier  I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice  but I don't know if it's worth the cost. So we've got to discuss that. For the case of the remotes itself  um they can be a general case  which is just a flat one. You can have uh a curved one or a double curved one  if you know what I mean  so You know  kind of more ergonomic  that kind of suits the palm of your hand  that kind of thing. So Um then the case material itself  so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex  uh rubber  wood  or titanium. And th for each of them you have uh cases where for example titanium  you can't use it for if you if we're choosing a double curved case  we can't choose titanium. And if we are choosing um solar cells then we can't choose latex for the case material  so we just have to take that into account. But if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything. And I think we discussed earlier on the R_ S_ I_ problem thing  so we could uh Yeah. Yeah. And also it doesn't break as easily maybe  I dunno So rubber would be Okay. Uh s so if d okay. And then there are the push-buttons  so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels  like you have on a mouse  um or you could have um L_C_D_  which gives you a display. Um scroll buttons  as well. So if you use a rubber double curved case  you must use rubber push-buttons. So if we're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case. Um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons. So it's a constraint. Yeah  but is it a double curved one or not? If it's not a double curved  then we've got the choice for the push-buttons  if it's a double curve  we've gotta go for rubber push-buttons. If that makes sense. Yeah.. No  but na le you see  you've got  okay  the energy that's one thing  then you have the case is uh  whether it's flat or curved. And that's we don't care if it's rub rubber or not  but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material. So if we've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it's flat  single curved or double curved. And I'm just saying if it if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go I dunno why  but we need to go for uh rubber push-buttons. So  either I dunno we just need to decide on the on the case. Let's go crazy. And then  do I have a last slide? Yes  I do. Um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be so that's just the electronics between the but behind the push-buttons. Um and the price that go with it with it  so the simple push-buttons are gonna be the cheapest. Uh if we get a scroll-wheel  that's a higher price range. If we get an advanced chip which is um used for the L_C_D_  the display thing  then that's even more expensive. Mm.. Yeah. The infra-red. Yeah. Well  if if it's not chip on print then  I guess  you get different chip components  and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red. It's less expensive mm Technically speaking  it's not as advanced  but it does the job  too. Fo It doesn't  yeah  yeah  yeah. Totally. Yeah. So let's not go for the Yeah  yeah. I agree. So it's either um the scroll-wheel or the push-buttons. Well It'd be it'd be cool  but they are saying they've just developed it  I'm just guessing. But it's gonna be the most expensive option  probably and Hm. Just if you are really lonely  maybe. Channel five. And then it switches on. Okay  so I'll go back  maybe  to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem  what we should choose. So for the energy source  do we go for the battery or the Cheaper option. Are you happy with that? Okay. So we'll go for the battery. Then the case  do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved? Double? Okay  so then if we use double curved case  then we have to u choose rubber push-buttons  and that's fine? P Yeah. I thought they would give an option of flat buttons or a That they don't. Mm. Alright  that's me done. Sorry. Well Bluetooth would  for example  enable you  I think  to um um connect for example you if you get a w call on your mobile phone  but your mobile phone is downstairs or something  you would get on your television you're being called by this person right now. Things like that. No i No  but if you get Bluetooth on the remote  you'd be able to I with the television  yeah. I was just trying to find an advantage. Wha what w what advantage would you get for the Maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then. It's been done for watches  but I haven't seen that for remotes  yet. Change the batteries ever again. Yeah  well  and in little characters you say  yeah  but not too much. Yep. No vegetables. Well yeah  but Apple would sue you for that. sued the Beatles so Yeah. Why not? I'm gonna write that down. That's yeah. Although I'd be curious to see how many uh You know  there are some colours that I wouldn I would never choose  and I would be curious how many people choose that colour. Mm. And produce less of the silly colours  maybe. Yep. Alright. Mm. Cool. It is. Great. That's true. Doesn't Yeah. Are we taking these off? I feel like Madonna with one of these on. I said I feel like Madonna with one of these on. Right. Hello everybody. Back again for another wonderful meeting. Is uh everyone ready? Okay  we c we can hold on for a minute. I figured with the spam thing  if you can't beat it  join in. Are you ready? Okay  right  well  I take it that you are all ready now. Um alright first off we'll just uh recap from our last meeting. Um which was we got together just to basically decide on well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing  and who we all are and stuff like that  mm get bit more of an idea together of what's going on. Um what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is um now that we know what it is that we are doing  now we know that it's a T_V_ remote and stuff and you guys have just been off doing some some uh R_ and D_ for that  that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before  see I'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today. Um yeah  we're gonna hear your uh th three little presentations  whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want. Um I'd like to um hear o I'd like to hear who's g who's on the um from from uh Catherine actually first. I want what I'd like to hear about is uh if we've finally decided on um what sort of energy we're gonna be using and It's just that yeah  let's let's hear from you first. Get yourself in position. I don't think any of us remember the fifties. Do sol solar panel things  do they have to work from the sun or can they work from a light bulb? Does anybody know? Okay. Mm. Okay  jolly good. What's a double curved one? Okay. So that might be an idea of using the rubber  but then it should  you know yeah. when a T_V_ programme's got one watching the match and your team's just lost  you can fuzz it across the room and it'll bounce off the wall back at you. Yeah  I like that idea. Rubber  we're all we're all going we're all liking that idea? You think you can market that? Ooh  we like rubber  ooh. Uh-huh. Well  we're gonna go with I think we've decided that it's gonna be a rubber case so push buttons instead of the wheel? rubble double double. I'll have a Big Mac  please. Let's have rubber push buttons  hey. Yeah. Simple  yeah. Chip on print. It's a bit. Okay  uh what I'm not understanding here is uh  okay  advanced chip on print  which I presume is like one P_C_B_ and that's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra-red sender? Right. Um what a what alternatives do we have to that? Y um what alternatives do we have to the chip on print? so it sounds So  why would we not go for that? If it's something that's inside the the unit. I it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not. Um we wanna go for an i i all so long as it works  you know. So let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print. Yeah. S yeah  push buttons. What about what? Well  what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit? S Yeah. It's not something that we wanna t go into with this product. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Basic battery. It's cheap  it's cheerful  it's worked  does work. We were go we were going with the late with the the R_S_I_ rubber  weren't we? The the The double whopper  please. Yep  but we're going for the simple buttons. Yeah. And it's cheapest all round  it sounds kinda funky  and we can also market it as i 'cause we were s saying earl you were saying earlier in your research that um the the people have the R_ people were getting the complaining about R_S_I_  and this is anti-R_S_I_. So that's another marketing point that we can use. But anything is gonna have buttons. Even if it's a jog wheel  it's still repetitive. You You see  you can still get it does you still get repetitive strain injury  whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen. It's the v it's the fact that you are pressing the same doing the same movement. It's not actually what you are doing. But the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti-R_S_I_ ps specific Yeah. And you know  yeah  you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children yeah. Okay  Gabriel. Let's um let's let's hear from you about the um it's the interface. Great. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do we have an uh example of a good one? Brilliant. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Well let's um so w what are our definite decisions on this then as a team? The um The the um the interface type we're going for Just the simple s simple straight set of buttons. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay  and we're not yeah. Are we gonna hav hav an are we d have we decided on whether w we're gonna s supplement it with anything  you know  colours or particular gimmicky bits to it  we're not we're just gonna go for something We're Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okey-dokey. Yeah  I don't have any other questions on this. Let's move over to Yeah  sure.. Yeah  the button that just does that  yeah. Cool. Mm yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah  why should people buy this when they're already got a remote that came with the T_V_? What's that mean? Okay  now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already  that's cheap. Yeah. Maybe we could um Of course  they do. One hundred per cent  that's your first thing  you go  oh I'm not gonna buy that  'cause I dunno if it works or not. Okay  well  what do you two think about this? Yeah  what I don't understand what m Yeah  and it this is just gonna all this is being used for is your television. It would that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it  which no no television does  does it? That would mean we'd have to make a television as well. No  that would be your telephone in with your television. Yeah  and i Nah  the televi the television would have to be a Bluetooth compatible  basically. An and there is no there is no such thing. Okay. Okay. Yeah  this that's that's very good. And and this is all tying in very nicely. The fact that it's made out of this rubber  we can throw it about. Th we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about  because it charges itself up by doing it. But yeah  by the squeezing it the Yeah  that's a great idea. Well done. Yeah. I wanna watch the pineapple channel. Well spongy  that's where. Yeah  we're we're ahead of the game there. Okay. Alright  yeah  no  this i this is good  so through all that we've we go we're right  we're gonna go go back to um going with the kinetic thing  that's great  using the spongy rubber that we were talking about that anti-R_S_I_ you can as you squeeze it you are not only therapeuticising yourself  you are charging the batteries  and um I'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though.. Yeah  this is true. Well  okay  it seems like the only thing that we haven't really finally um agreed on is its image. Like  yeah  we're we're saying no we don't want it to be fruit and vegetables  but we dunno what it should be  or like are we going yeah it looks slick  but what do what do we mean by slick sort of thing? I mean you said earlier on i it should be funky. L keep it clean  keep it clean. Bright  but not too bright. Like the volume buttons should be the all the same colour and the d and the the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that  do you mean? Okay  what? Okay. Tha Yeah  I mean we that's we we Yeah. This is the remote control tomato. Yeah. Well  it's it's gotta be chew proof. So  what are you saying  maybe we should market it in different colours for different so we could do like the pink range  the blue range  the green range  the Mm. Well that's that can be down to bit of market researching you know  if that's easy enough to find out what colours are more popular. Mm. Okay. Alright. Well um  we'll alright let's what we're gonna aim to get together by the next meeting then um is from you Catherine wi your y y you know you're gonna be working on the the look and feel design. Um Gabriel  you're gonna be working on  you know come up with the the user interface design. Then basically  you two are gonna be working together on this. You won't be going off to your separate offices. Um and I think you are gonna get a chance to play with some clay. I think  yeah  it's gonna you know  come up ki you know  be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some some i some physical ideas. 'Cause at the moment  uh you know  it's it's hard. We were kinda going  yeah  it's gotta feel nice  it's gotta look cool and that it's you know now we can actually start  you know  s some sort of physical something or other. Um and you're gonna be working on the product evaluation. Um. And I will be uh talking to the bosses  basically  and uh f fielding off some more spam and uh that's it really. Keeping things t well  uh you know  ho hopefully uh keeping things together. Um. Yeah  that's This is this is uh good. So we know for definite we know we've we've now got some definite things going on. We definitely know how it's powered  we definitely know that um it's gonna be a simple buttons  we're not gonna be going for the new technological chip on print expensive things  so we've we're keeping the costs down. It's this rubber casing that we can sell as um fun and funky. Don't know of any other remote controls that are made out of this stuff. People  you know  people are saying  oh  standard stuff gives you repetitive strain injury  well this remote control is designed to do the complete opposite  It's supposed to fix it rather than cause it. Um. you know  we're gonna we we're gonna as a sort of extra something on it  you know what what extra things are there extra things this product have? We'll look into this lock key facility  although whether or not it happens  or is possible  I don't know  but something to look into. Okay. I think that's um well done everybody. Anyone have any uh any questions  everyone know what they're doing? 'Cause if you don't  you'll I'm sure you'll soon get an e-mail about it. Okay. right well. It's um we're we've still couple of minutes until our meeting's due to finish. But um I got a note saying that you two who are gonna be working together so bef before you all disappear off just hold hold fire. Um. Um I think  it's uh  yeah  I think  it's gonna be par part more of a profit sharing on the product. Yeah  I think i I think that's I think that's the way it's gonna happen at the moment. Yeah. Yeah. I want a share in the space rocket. Did you see that this k that this company we've made a spaceship. Yeah. Yeah.. Yeah. Mm. And the spaceship doesn't have the R_ have a massive R_ and R_ down the side of it but I still want one. Okay. Um I've just had a sign flashing up saying  finish the meeting. Uh. Yeah. Yeah. It's not telling it's not saying do anything in particular just yet. So maybe you should go back to your own offices. Yeah. Yeah  it says you two ,The project manager opened the meeting and had the team members introduce themselves and describe their roles in the upcoming project. The project manager then described the upcoming project. The team then discussed their experiences with remote controls. They also discussed the project budget and which features they would like to see in the remote control they are to create. The team discussed universal usage  how to find remotes when misplaced  shapes and colors  ball shaped remotes  marketing strategies  keyboards on remotes  and remote sizes. 
I'm proud of it. Uh-huh. How how much do we have  forty minutes? Yeah. Okay  so. Presentation. Okay. Okay. So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana. Um Yeah. Um Yeah. Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again. So now we we have the okay  so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there. And it flips open on the side  so it opens like that. And we have the user interface o in here and uh the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside. Um well  everything else is probably user interface  so. Yeah  yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah  it has  yeah. Yeah  well  but i since it's made of rubber anyway. I I think it's it's uh Yeah. Mm. Hmm. It's on the side. Uh no  we we'd not put so on on the cover we have the the bare essentials. Uh on the L_C_D_ we r you know  the main menu will have various options. Mm. Mm. Yeah  it's hidden in there somewhere. Cool. We ran out of resources here  so. You can have a look. Yeah  see the budget. I guess we'll give it maximum points in everything. So? Yes. Okay. But we can we can I can I can take note uh uh Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people  so if you're left-handed you're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger. But then yeah. Yeah. So bu it's it's not a huge problem  because i i it is operatable. Right. Yeah. Yep. Mm. Mm. One more thing is that i It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up  right  so it opens on the side. So Yeah yeah yeah  I mean yeah. So you guys can decide wh whether Oops. Yeah  but we which makes it kind of really big  yeah. Uh this this kind of uh makes it more and two  it might interfere with the I_R_ channel. Okay. Right. Okay. No  we have a locator. Yeah. Yeah. Intuitive  completely intuitive. Intuitive. And uh even the scroll  it's a it's a new technology so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni so it is kind of not very intuitive but uh it's a good technology  I mean once they get used to it. Yeah. So l Yeah  okay. I'm gonna give a seven in everything  so. Mm.. Yeah. Yeah  unless you are a all the time sitting. Yeah. Yeah  I I think it is ergonomic. Mm yeah. And moreover it it has um L_C_D_ and everything  so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway. Absolutely. So it has voice control. Yep. Anyway it ha yeah  it's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen. Yeah  but they've been brought together in a remote. Yeah. Absolutely. The carrot banana remote. I think that's a. Yeah. There are how many sixes? One  two  three. Three. And one five. Okay  twenty eight  thirty eight  fo forty six. Forty six and five  fifty one. Fifty one divided by Mm I guess it'll have to wait for a bit. Mm. Advanced  yeah. Yep. Mm anything uh I think which is not more. Yeah. Mm. No uh we we have uh yeah. Mm no. We don't have we're not using any of that. Huh? Wh wh what is the limit? Uh. Mm I don't think so  no. No it says what what is the kind of interface  if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five  it's a scroll wheel so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display  so that's that's the three kind of interfaces that we have. Wh wh what's our criteria? Uh okay. Uh it does not have for voice recognition  but it does have for the feedback speaker. when you say when you press one it says one or it says hello. Mm and the locator also goes away. A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface  because it's just rubber  so it's probably a flat surface rubber. Uh I mean uh um yeah. Um So tha that mean that we cannot press how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the L_C_D_? If in the L_C_D_ we can scroll  right? But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button. No w w w but ha it's it's the scroll wheel and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing. That comes with the L_C_D_? Oh so so the the this is. So we're adding costs for right  okay uh I mean I think this is good. Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here  up for up and down. On the side. Mm uh it sounds good actually  yeah.. We have  yeah. Not really  no. Because we keep all the features  we keep voice recognition  we keep L_C_D_ display. We instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons. Um yeah. Yeah. But we lose the locator. So instead of speaker . 'Kay. I think it mm I think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with. Um we kap kept a adding things randomly. So  had we known Yeah  that or not  yeah. Yeah. So d all the random decisions at the end could have been prevented. Mm. Yeah  mm. Yeah yeah yeah  that's it's it's I wonder what one of these costs. Yeah. Mm yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. I guess it was a fairly small group  so all of us got to express our opinions  yeah. Mm. Hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I thought that was good though  because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and um yeah. Although we could have made the R_s better had we had five more minute. We certainly are  mm. Yeah. Yeah  same here. Mm uh no. I don't think so. Was there a questionnaire already sent? Okay. This is our final meeting  the detailed design meeting. And again I'll take minutes. The what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two  so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently. Um then then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against. Then I need to say some st a few things about finance  'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria. Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits. Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through. So we've got forty minutes. S 'Cause we missed out. So it's now I guess that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five  so we've got until four fifteen. Is that right? Yeah  until about four fifteen. So yeah. Go for it. Do you want Yes. Dual use  perfect. Dual use  perfect. Does it vibrate when you press the buttons? Sorry  sorry. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Wow. And it's the whole thing's made of rubber  is that Mm-hmm. Yeah. Huh. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Six seven eight nine. I like that. Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Y or you could have it so you on the wheel if you. But if you hold it in  if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in? no. Mm-hmm  very good. And it's with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours. Mm-hmm. Very good  let's have a look. Test it out. Uh it's a sort of intermediate colour  I guess. Very good. Okay  so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria and then we'll there I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues  but um we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow. We'll just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country and cut some of the prices that way. Wales  for example. Marketing Expert. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven. Is that right? Mm dots  never mind. Yeah  I agree. Yeah  just prepare one now. I reckon it Yeah. Seven  yeah  it's terribly sexy. Yeah. Ah  okay. Excellent. Except we can't uh we can if we then yeah  I'll take a note  it's fine. Yeah. I think it does. Alright. But that's gonna be a problem  'cause you don't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Um Six. Yeah  I think I think for um I mean most people are right-handed  so in in terms of our greatest target group  I think it's pretty good  but we might want to flag it for management  they want might want to um They Mm-hmm. Yeah. The length is gonna be difficu Mm. No  we're gonna put it like we've got th there's the locator dot. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. I'd say six  'cause the I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one  rather than the way you've got it. I really like the way you have it  but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to. So Might be But it and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon. Five? Yeah. I'm happy with five? Yeah. Yep. But otherwise it's superb. Six. Yeah. Well we've banned them from Yeah. Yeah  it's varied. Yeah. Six? Voice control have seven. Ah  that's the second one. So you must have changed it on this one where it's got score  but not on the previous slide. G_ technologically innovative. But in terms of the actual technology  none of it is actually new. Yeah. All of the components have been used in other things before. But do yeah  yeah. Yeah. What do you reckon  five  six? Yeah. Space remote. Put fashion in electronics. Very good. Yeah  one. Or a seven. Fifty one  one  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight. Six point point about six point five. Close enough. Now wait until we get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it. That's all you've got at the moment  or did you have anything more? That's it? Alright. So  finance. And we'll see if we can unscrew this first. Sorry  this is I'm just um Beautiful. Not anymore. Computer no signal? Adjusting. There we go. Okay  so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria. And now we have to calculate the production costs. So I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that. Can you read that? Almost. More or less. Um I started filling it in  but of course these are provisional  so we have to go down. No hand dynamo  right? One simple battery. No kinetic energy  no solar. The chip  we're going for an advanced chip on print. We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker. Um single-curved surface  so that we can fold it. Case material we said rubber. I don't know what special colour means. It could be Rub rubber comes coloured  it's I would maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured  it's different. Yeah  let's leave it as zero  'cause it's easy. We we're definitely going to have to so we've got pushbutton  and then we've Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had  no? S for the muting. Yeah. And button supplements. No. No? But the the spinning wheel's not there. I have think maybe it's integrated with the L_C_ display? I think the pushbutton oh. I don't know if that's one Yeah. That seems unlikely. Push what uh whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we I don't think that makes sense. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So  as we can see  that's way too expensive down here. Our budget's twelve point five. Yeah  so that has implications though for the. For the locator. Yeah. Yeah. What else does it need? Yeah  'cause the sample speaker was  I think  more complicated then just a beeping thing. Yeah  okay  so we Uh-huh. Right  so we need one fifty off. Take it down to just a scroll wheel. We could do Yeah. You can have to scroll it straight r roll it straight down for for mute. That's with the L_C_ We decided  'cause it's not on our list. The scroll wheel is on the side. We're point three over at the moment. It's nothing n Yeah  I have Yeah. Rather than having three different things that people have to do. There we go. Oh look  we're way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll all get bonuses. Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour. So that's alright. We we'll leave it at that and then I'll take I can send it back to management and say we weren't quite sure about the colour  if that costs extra then we've still got some space for it  yeah. Excellent. Alright. So did we lose um on our evaluation criteria  as a result of doing that? Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Alright then. We're gonna have a beep. Yeah. Yeah. Tha. 'Cause we we won't have run out of our pot of Play-Doh. Yeah  I know I know  my pen vibrates. But only for a very short time. Um okay. So looks like we've designed a banana. Well done  team. Um we need we've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting  so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went  um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product. Feedback? Ideas? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. But in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting  that that worked in terms of. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Banana. Mm-hmm  the whiteboard digital pens. We like the pens. Yeah  you could take it to lectures and just write stuff down and have it printed out when you got back to the office. They great? Do you think they'd notice if one went? Oh okay. Yep. Shh. Yep. But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint  'cause the I find that the problem with PowerPoint often is that it's so static and you can't change it once you're in there  yep. Mm-hmm. Yeah. That's alright  that always irritates me anyway  yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. And presumably you don't you can say nasty things as well. I have no stake in it. You have to say that  'cause I'm taking the notes. I'll leave the room and you can have another go. Better than that than the banana. I think it worked quite well. Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit? Yeah.. New ideas found. Not quite sure what about. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah  that's right. Banana remote. Yeah. Or you can always go to Google and type in banana remote control. Flip. Vibrate. And uh yeah. Nothing that you really want. True. Yeah. Okay. So  costs are within budget  well within budget  including a little what have we got? One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee. Um we've evaluated the project. You've got the scores. Can you put that in the project documents file? It's in there already. And the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with. Were there any was there anything that you found difficult  or anything that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope? Yeah. Okay then. Um I think we're still well within our time. We've got about five minutes left  but if we've finished  then we've finished. We're just too too efficient and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time. So I would say that's the end of that meeting. Thank you  team. It was very productive day and Mm uh no. Right  so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it. I don't know if it's already sent or not. Um presumably I have to I don't see why you can't stay here  really. Did I save this one? Production costs. It was supposed to be pink. But it was blue on the board. Yeah. Yeah  about four fifteen  yeah. So  you said um are are we starting with the the so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things  like the buttons and the scrolling things and Well  but it's it's just an a approximation. Uh yeah. Rubber. Yeah . Um it could be made a bit smaller  and and of course it would be and yeah  but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing  that one side was supposed to be rounder  so we said the back side round  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it's spongy as well. So so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the on the cover we just have the very basic things. So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three there would be numbers in in the on the actual one. So it's four  up to four  up to seven  up to nine and zero  z zero here. Yeah. And then  well this is on off button. It's it's quite standard mm place for it and and also the colour is quite often red  so it's it's kind of user friendly. And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and like the previous one and the next one. And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here  previous and ne prevon prevon next. The volume is is scrolling. On the side  this one. Yeah you just do it like this. And and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid  because if you flip it open  you can still do the scrolling here. See? So the volume is you just scroll  but then once you flip it open  okay  there there you have the screen and and you have the mm spinning wheel with options to choose. You can move back and forth and then if you need to m choose something on the screen  you just push the cen mm the middle button. A mute button. Well  we'll have this on the screen  on the display. Well  but the but the mute yeah  the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute  right? Okay  yeah  okay. Yeah. And okay  so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it. You can't really see it in the interface. Yeah. And we do have the logo on it as well. So I think it Yeah. Yeah  I think um we could do l the logo in grey  as it is on the website. In the actual one. Yeah. So if you have questions. Yeah. Yeah  the yeah  it's definitely attractive. Oh  the locatable thing we actually forgot. Yeah. Shall I just prepare it now? It will be red  too. S seven was th the maximum  yeah? I I go for seven. I would think yes  yeah. Yeah  so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m model another another version  which is like exactly the mirror image of this one. Yeah. But then then I think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway  so they just Yeah. Yeah  because I mean anyway  right-handed people would be able to scroll with it  so i if the majority are right-handed  it's uh Or maybe six  because it's just one one i one among the issues  I mean. Yeah. Yeah. No  yeah  but mm but we have it nicely with the hinges here yeah. So it won't be a problem  it will be and it will be it won't be heavy. Yeah well yeah  but it's it's a bit long. It's a little bit long. Well  I mean it can be opened like this of course and yeah. S uh slightly smaller. Yeah  but if we flip it open only as much as that. Mm that you stick on T_V_. Yeah well w but l but the speak sample speaker is included  so it it has some capacity to mm to do some to make some sounds  so yeah. Yep. Yeah. If uh uh if this means intuitive  if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things and it's I th I think it's Yeah. Yeah. Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design well mm I mean I d uh I dunno  I mean the the repetitive stress things  but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway  yeah? See. Yeah  so it's kinda Yeah. Yeah  it does have yeah. Technologi well Yeah. Well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well  which is yeah  it's kind of new. But at the same time they are all they are all relatively new. Six. I mean how how far can you go with a remote control  really? It still has to do what i what it has to do. Yeah  isn't it fashionable? Yeah  sure. It's the maximum fashion. Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days  so. So I think we've done very well  but What's the assessment? The average is about six and something. A little bit over six. No  wait  a little bit under six. No  wait. Oh  three sixes  okay  yeah. Four sevens. Six point something  yeah. Six point five  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yeah  yes. Rubber. I think something coloured  yeah  probably. So I think this is probably special co no? Yeah. Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it  yeah yeah  okay. Yeah. We have pushbuttons  scro we have scroll wheel as well. S yeah  yeah  we had  for muting  yeah. And we have L_C_ display and yeah. Um Yeah  but what do we ha we have L_C_ display  but but the wh but the s spinning wheel Yeah. Okay  let's yeah. We have to count all of them  or yeah. But it was very no innovative innovativeness. Well um yeah. Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive  but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps. This would be Yeah  yeah yeah there you record your samples your speech samples and Yeah  then then we would be in the b budget. Yeah b no no  you can push this one  but we don't have a pushbutton uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing. Mm-hmm. But I mean we can put an additional mute button on the top as well. If you Mm. So Mm-hmm. Okay  yeah. Okay. Yeah. Well we're going to have a beeping thing. But yeah  it's it's not like sample speaker  but it will just beep  so we still have the locate. Which colour  the the colour of the phone or the colour of the But it can be yellow as well. It can come in the same colour as the the case. Yeah mm  as far as creativity is concerned  yeah I think there was there was room for creativity. The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had. Yeah  yeah  yeah. Yeah. Yeah  the m the means were very very good  the means we used. And the pens. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Yeah  and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the Yeah. But yeah  but I mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was I was satisfied with with the leadership  yeah. Mm-hmm. And then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite quite nicely  yeah. To express them mm mm no. Well it's it's it's pretty new  pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really  all this flipping open thing and Yeah  neither neither do I  but I've never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this  actually  so. Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one. Patent patent patent. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yes. Yes. And my main difficulty was the the time pressure. Otherwise it's it's all fine. Yeah  yeah  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yeah  it was a pleasure working with you. You can make some animals. Oh  you don't like anim It doesn't? Smells quite nice. Smells very sweet. I made your animal for you. Yeah  that's the one It does look very cool. And then do we get to make a remote control? Yeah. Yeah. You think bananas are a safe thing to use? It's a bit um phallic. Oh  your remote control? Oh that's just bad. Is it to scale  or do you think you can make it a bit smaller? Yeah. It l does look like the curvy and then the whole shape's curvy  so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable. I wasn't very keen on that  but yeah. So where's the volume? Ah  you did get that in then  mm-hmm. Oh okay . Cool. Oh  the thing we forgot was like a mute button. Yeah. On the wheel  like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute. Yeah  but it's a scroll and click  isn't it? Okay  cool. So that that solves the whole mute issue.. Yeah.. Yeah  oh  we hold the remote. Oh  but it it does feel all cold and slimy. I hate Play-Do  it's just minging. But yeah  uh that's cool  cool. Mm-hmm. Okay. Wales. Mm. Cool  okay. Right  okay. Fabulous  yeah. Okay  cool. So what we're gonna do is prefer prepare the evaluation of the new design. Um so we're gonna be using a seven point scale  so one is  you know  yes  it totally meets with that requirement and seven is  no  it really doesn't  we need to go back and start again. Um  you know. Basically  what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them. Um you know  so that we can evaluate each one and like so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah  we did manage to do that  or oh no  we really forgot about that. Okay? Cool  so these are what they are. Oh Yes  I did have A_  B_  C_  and D_ down here  but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points. Okay. But if you can imagine that they say A_  B_  C_  and D_  then that would be really good. Well  I thought we'd um kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the T_V_? Yeah. Cool. Okay. So  be attractive to look at. That's this one. What do you all say? Yeah. Oh we're all so proud of the. Okay  so that'll be a seven for A_. Could oh no  you can't whilst that's up there. Okay um uh what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in. Yeah. But that's alright. If you take a note of them  and then I'll put them in in a minute. Okay  so we're all agreeing on seven for A_? Cool  okay. Does it match the operating behaviour of the user? Yeah. I mean Yeah. I th I think it's not it's not like it's a pen. Yeah  but I mean because it's not like it's a pen  you know  left-handed people can't normally write right-handed  but they can normally do most things right-handed  so I would say it's not such a big issue. Yeah. I mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb. So I mean that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue. So maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation  maybe give it a five  I would say? What do you what do you all think? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top. Yeah um But you were thinking about making it smaller  yeah? Because So you have to keep that side flat. So it works like a mobile phone flipping  but y you know  as long as that side's flat  than that will work. Okay. Um okay  so C_. Are are we admitting defeat on C_ or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_? There's a locator. Cool  so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though  doesn't it? To make it beep. Or a buzzer. Okay. So that's two  so that's seven  yeah. It's locatable? Fabulous. D_. Yeah. Yeah  and I mean d So  should we maybe say f a five and say it is intuitive  but it's different  so  do you know  I mean it's obvious how to use it  but you might have to think about it first. So we give that one a five  you think? Yep. I'm glad you're accepting this. It has taken a little while  hasn't it? Um intuitive but Sorry  it's really hard to write on those. I just went a bit mad  didn't I? Um okay  cool  E_  okay. Um I would guess this comes back from this whole B_ thing links in here  so possibly for left-handed. Investigate. So  should we give it a six? Six? I used to send fifty texts a day  you know  and I never got repetitive strain injury from that  so I find it quite hard to believe to be honest. Okay  so we give that a six  yeah. Okay  F_. Hang on  how come it's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there? That's just Oh okay  cool. Um right  so. Yes  so that's a seven then. Um  cool. Yeah  but I mean you don't They're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before I don't think.. Yeah  what do you all think? Six? Well  that's it  I mean Yeah  but I mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really  hasn't it? So  I don't think many peop That's it  they can take it with them. So  we give it seven  and we write There we go. Cool. So  we need the average here  so we got Seven So we've got four sevens  so that's twenty eight  three sixes  eighteen. Two three four Seven eight. Okay  that's pretty good  I think. Um no  that's it  yeah. Cool  there we go.. There we go and there are the marks. Yeah. Yeah  but rubber comes coloured  doesn't it? You know. Yeah  you might end up having to take off the sample sensor.. No. We've got more than one pushbutton though  haven't we? 'Cause then you have That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it? Not counting anything  we'd still be in budget. Twelve point five. No. Well it doesn't  but it uh And L_C_ display. This sample sensor. Yeah  the sample sensor will have to go  'cause that's the most expensive thing on there. Yeah. But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really  isn't it? We can afford to get rid of it. So that means no locator  does it? I mean does Yeah. Yeah. Okay  yeah. See  I was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing  'cause But that's well you would just have to to spin it down. So that's point three. Yeah  I mean that wouldn't actually cost any more. That's the spin wheel though  isn't it? Didn't that come with the L_C_ Yeah. Yeah. S so we're point three over. Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether and just have pushbuttons for the volume. Could b still put them on the side. But yeah. I mean the scroll wheel's pretty cool  but Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  well we could admit to the single curve  couldn't we? Yeah  but Yeah. Yeah. No. No  I don't think so. Yeah. We just got rid of a gimmick that was never anyway  and the scroll wheel is I mean essentially the two buttons that was it's not a great difference I don't think. Really? Cool. That's not a very exciting colour. I think you should make it more vegetable-like. Oh the the beeper thing. It Yeah  I think Jen wants it to vibrate. You know  your pen vibrates? Yeah. Cool. Yeah. If we'd had that sheet at the beginning should've been like  okay  so we can have that lot  let's just throw it together and do what we can. Yeah. I think 'cause the meetings were so regular  you know. It wasn't like we were alone for very long  so you didn't st go off and think  wouldn't it be great to have a vibrating remote control shaped like a banana  and then  you know  come back three days later and Jen's going look  look  it vibrates and it looks like a banana. Um yeah  so yeah. Uh I like the pens. I want one. That would just be so cool  to d do all your notes and s I don't think you should say that was the recording. Okay  cover up the microphone. Alright  let's take it. Okay. It is a bit limiting  isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. The thing flew in  you didn't have the whole whooshing thing  'cause there wasn't time for that  so yeah. Not that you can do that on the board  either. We could make some little Yeah  totally  I mean that was fairly tight anyway  I mean especially with that last-minute alteration. back it  this is just had to be changed. And yeah  so cool. Are we supposed to say nice things about Jen now? Yeah  definitely. You weren't like a a dictating leader  so that was always good. I know you've got the pen  you might attack me with it. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know  I don't go shopping for remote controls that often  maybe somebody's already though of it. Yeah. Yeah. I'll be looking out next time I need to write an essay. That looks boring  I'll see if anyone's made a remote control. Yeah  yeah. I think we'd like to think the ideas were new  but we've got no way of finding out. That vibrates Yeah  but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it. Yes. And it's fabulous. It's in the project documents. Yeah  yeah  sometimes it's like a little bit rushed. Yeah  we've got like five minutes left. Yeah. 'Kay. We could draw animals on the board again. I don't like Play-Doh  no. It's just minging. It smells so bad. It does. Mm. No  it hasn't been. Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now? Okay  so the other way. ,For the first meeting  the task of designing a remote control was briefly introduced along with the plan for the subsequent meetings. The group then drew animals to practise using the drawing platform. They discussed their likes and dislikes regarding current remote controls  including ease of use  multiple systems and power indicators. They then offered suggestions as to what they would like from their remote. They would like the remote to be durable  for it to include a device to help find it when lost and not use too many batteries. 
Well I'll uh start just with another presentation  so then we can uh look at th at the agenda uh for this meeting. Okay. I've put some uh new things in the in the map. Uh oh. This is it. I don't know the shortcut  so Ah F_ five. Well our functional design meeting  that's the stage we're in. And you also ha all three of you have uh prepared something about it. Well um in we'll uh just have a look at the at the notes from the previous meeting  what we uh thought we had dec decided. But uh Uh then we'll uh look at uh the three uh presentations uh from you. I think you have prepared uh all three uh? Um we'll look at th the new project requirements we uh I dunno. Y you also have uh received that mail  the new project requirements from our bosses? Oh I've received a mail with uh some additional requirements  and I'll have a look if Well I think we should show them before your presentations  because it's not really uh smart uh to uh to include some things uh we can't  because of the new requirements. Well um then we can make some decisions about our remote control functions. We have to deb we have to decide it in this meeting what our function will be. And then uh we can discuss uh some more closely. Uh Uh yeah  I think so. Well uh the closing uh we'll not uh look at it yet. Um now I'll look at show this board. Um Well uh notes  first meeting. Now. I gave a disc a a presentation. Uh we familiarised ourself with the boards and then we discussed some first ideas. So we said that uh we have to merge the strong points from our uh competitors  and uh look at their uh remote controls. We should make it uh compatible with our new D_V_D_ and other releases we have  our technical releases. Uh not too many one buttons. One recognisable button in the middle  where you do the most important functions with. And um well they can have two functions  because uh you have a D_V_D_ and a television. Um the design has to fit the hand  be original  but also be familiar. It's uh one of our ideas. Yeah well that wa It's just thirty minutes ago  so it's not quite uh But well I have to do it. The materials uh well should be hard plastic with rubber from  and uh well the labelling of the buttons should be indestructible. It should be uh recognisable at all times. Yes. Well fronts were to be just like mobile telephones. And uh the technical aspects um And also labelling of the buttons  the functions should be universal standards. Well that's just uh some ideas from the first meeting. It's quite logical al all of it. Um now the new project requirements  I'll just show them. I got this mail from uh our bosses. Well  teletext goes out. We will not use teletext. Maybe a new sort of thing  but n but not teletext. Well the second is a bit sh pity because we just said we wanted to d include the D_V_D_ and they don't want it  because of our time we have for this project. So that's a shame  because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years. Because uh we don't have those customers a lot at th at this point. Um well it's a bit pity because it's just those people want to have uh one remote control for all those technical devices they can uh reach it. Yeah. Well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products. So uh we have to uh use uh maybe a slogan  maybe a colour  and um Yeah well uh on our remote controls the design has to be uh  well as we already said a actually  uh familiar. Uh not only just uh the shape but also our company. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yes. I I uh noted uh our uh slogan that we have  our company. It's uh we mm put the fashion in electronics. So maybe that's a slogan we can put uh somewhere on our remote control or something. Alright then um we're going to uh have three presentations. You want to start? Oh you have to start? I didn't see anything about uh who had to start. Well s then start. Okay. Well uh You already uh opened uh PowerPoint. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well It should actually uh It should actually be loose from the television  because it can also be used for other televisions. So if you deliver a small uh click-on device that you can put on your television  that bleeps to your remote control  everyone can use it. No you can click it on your television. Yeah in another room  yeah. Well yes. Yeah. Well we'll have a look at it  yeah. Yep. Well there sh should always be a menu  but it c can be very short. Yes okay. Well we are a design team  we can say to some uh writer uh make a manual point. So Well we'll have a look. Um yes? Yep. Well Well with twelve Euro fifty as production cost  we can't uh afford an L_C_D_ uh Yeah. Well Yeah well uh it's your your task to uh look into the costs uh of those uh Nigh I know. It's not yet a standard uh development uh those so We sh Yeah absolutely. Yep. 'Kay. Alright. Yes. Well you I c I can uh still see your presentation. It's in the Well uh next um I dunno who is next. You uh got uh Yes. Well go ahead. Yip. F_ five. F_ five. Click. Yep. Yeah. So it is also why we have to have a button that says uh I'm now busy with a D_V_D_ uh if we had done that. And a button for T_V_. So Well but but if you have um the most used buttons all in one place  and you keep making the same um well moves. But if y if you would put it at a different place  then you have to move your hands  and that's on of the things about R_S_I_. No but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_. Yes I've saw that on m on mi mobile telephones they also have uh those buttons. Well it it's Well also i if someone puts picks up his uh remote Yeah. If someone puts up i uh picks up his remote  and he picks up it he he touches the side then he's a already on the next channel. That's very irritating  I think. Well. No. Yep. Mm-hmm. That's your part of the job. Yep. Okay. Well we understand. We understand. Oh right  no. Nice. Then uh Mike can uh give the third presentation. How late is did we start his presentation uh? Wha Yeah. Well then we have still the time  so But we do have to come to a decision  right later on. So Oh yeah? Uh? Okay  yeah well. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. I like user-centred. Yeah. We also do that. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well absolutely  but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company. So we cannot just uh make someone w No but that's th the side they look uh look at is the front. So if y if you make a a front with just a a tiger on it  then uh our recognition is totally gone. Yeah  we must. Yeah well and and Yes. 'Kay. Yeah yeah yeah. Or the th the the lowest part of the remote isn't changed by the front. Those kind of things. Yes. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Alright. Yeah? Well what if we um I at I at home have a remote that has um the most familiar uh buttons on the top  and the bottom side of the front has a little clip  a f a little uh You can click away and then you have f much more functions that most people don't use but s some do do. Well but because you say they their features are important  they want m um a lot  but not Yeah. Competitors. Yeah. Well maybe w we could uh s On um some uh calculators you have lo those little little L_C_D_ th that you can click on or something  or that you can click uh out uh of the remote. And if if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information. Yeah. Those kind of things  uh because you also have those uh those program recognition for your V_ V_C_R_s. And uh well if y if your remote picks that up also  you they can display which programme you're currently watching. Yeah. For example. It it could be such a little uh th that you can click in and out and you and you have it. Yeah. Well maybe. Yeah. Yeah. R_D_S_s or something. Well I think it's you got It just means it's a script that's uh keeps it uh rolling  and it's not uh That's five minutes off uh implementing time I think uh Yeah. No. Uh well I think so  yes. Um We're g No but we're we'll have to look into that. Um we can use this board again  I think. Uh we can put some um decisions about um the controls we want  th the issue. Where is my presentation? Uh Uh Well I mean we're all here now  I think. These I've already given you. So we have to decide on the different remote control functions. So we want to have a small L_C_D_ screen that's special. Yes. Yeah. That thing is terrible. Uh Well Well I th I think Mike Mike has a point  because um when when uh when I use a remote I l I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom. So and and I I like to use the ones on the top. So when I u when I have to have an L_C_D_ s scr window Yes but we we we we don't want that. We don't want them to look like a calculator. We want to look it like our original but familiar Yea Maybe a bic uh better uh white uh We White? Width. Uh format yeah format? Line width? Width? Yeah? It's a bit off. Well. Well uh let's uh talk about that later uh It's special pen. Yeah. No. I think it should be at the button  bottom. Bottom. The L_C_D_. Yeah. Well but uh what what if we we first decide the different functions  and then look at the design. Because we have to decide this. Yeah. Yes. Well we have a power button. Guys? Guys? We have a power button  setting buttons  L_C_D_ window  the number buttons Uh Yes. Uh the mute button. I h love that one. Yes. Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah. Well that's that's also design. Yes. Um Well h ho Yes. Yes. They are for some uh video uh Apart. So people have to move their hand. And they get less uh complaints of R_S_I_. That's what I always do  because all my i important buttons are the same place. Yes? Well not Yes. Uh-huh. Up and down far apart from each other? Well not too much. Well for example the power button  you can If someone is constantly z zapping  it's not going to miss  that it that the power button is not right beside it. Because I have someone But the buttons is way. So that one can be put away. The power button can uh be uh uh Yes. Oh man  five minutes. Yeah  well five minutes left. Yep. Um how are we going to do it with those numbers? Well I have it here. Yeah well that's going to take too too much time. Yes. Yes. Well the L_C_D_. Um you are Industrial  you are User Interface. So I think it's going to go to Mike. But you will have to make consensus with. Well Well it's a bit hard  because we are going to be uh individually. That's a bit uh Yes. Yes it is. Well what if we're going to now decide about the functions  and the design comes into the next round? Plus the d th the design round is still to come huh? Alright these functions. The number f Well yes  that's alright. W the number function. Are we going to uh do it like uh on Mike's screen with uh one button that says I'm going to do a t two number digital? How do you want it to do then? It it has to r recognise one as there could still come more. Yes. Alright so no button for that. Okay uh anyone any uh oth other functionalities of our uh remote? So No  we'd uh just said we didn't uh Well uh Um well because we can't integrate it with any other uh remotes  all those buttons on those pictures are uh irrelevant. So just for a television is that all we need? Teletext is gone. So all those buttons that ar are to do with teletext Oh screen placing. We'll have uh those uh buttons about uh And uh the two important ones we're l f forgetting. Uh there's um screen. You can make it wider and less wide. And the button that you can go to A_V_ for your video. Those two? But it's just two  and we make a clip? Th that's a bit uh waste. Yes. Or at the top. Your L_C_D_ screen is going to go. Yes. Yeah Well I think they should in an in an isolated part of the remote. Yes? Yes. Yes. Well any other uh Go to video  that's always on your remote control. To A_V_ uh to A_V_ A_V_ A_V_. Well l n no not at not at my remote. Yeah. Yes. I don't. I go to ninety-nine. Th that's the button uh No. No you can ch push zero. Yeah. Yeah  I I think that one button is uh I use it uh Yeah? These buttons  I don't have buttons for channel setting uh especially on my remote. It's it's incorporated with p m plus and down  uh those So we still have one uh four? Ch ch Okay. Oh the Okay button? Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button  for your menu. Menu button. Channel  setting  menu. We have to go. Okay. So um Save. Yes see. Yes I have put it in. Here. Alright. Guys? We're going to uh go to our uh rooms  and uh we'll have to decide s things on our own I think. So Well see you uh W w we have lunchtime  by the way  now uh so uh Lunch. Ah. We didn't exactly do everything but So Great man. Who starts? Alright  great. Alright. Mm-hmm. Yes. 'Kay. Yeah. No. You're the only one. Alright. 'Kay. Alright. Right. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Alright. Yeah. But let's forget about it. It's just time-consuming  so we uh have to go on. Yes. Mm. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I think I have to start. Oh no  no problem. I I just have to uh to think which file's mine  'cause I was uh bit in a hurry. I think it's this one. But I'm not sure. Hmm? Yeah. S Right. Yes. This is it. Well  I'm going to tell you something about functional requirements. Um to start with these points. Uh next sheet? Um at first I tell you something about what people dislike about the current uh controls  because it's uh a smart thing to exclude those things. Uh  furthermore it's very important what they do like and what they do use. Um then I tell something about um the most important issues. So we have to focus on those three thing three things. And in the end I'll um show you our target audience or our target product users  customers. Well  um the first findings are that people um think most controls are very kind of ug ugly. That's seventy five per cent of the current users. They don't like it  so we might think about fronts in that section. Um They also say  that's about uh I thought it was fifty per cent  uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls. So it's very important that you design a a nice looking control. Um the current user uses his machine just about well all of the time for a few functions. Uh  almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity. So it's really important to make the the buttons for the common uh tasks kind of big or kind of uh flashy. Furthermore  it's uh seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot. Thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle  so you can reach it with your thumb. Yeah  yeah right. Right. A lot of losers um users lose their controls in their in their living room. So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television  that's your um your control beeps or something  that you can find this very easily. I dunno  maybe that's an idea. 'Cause it's uh a big I think fifty per cent of the users loses his its control  within the same room. So Yeah but what if you lose your click-on device? Yeah but if someone d somebody else uses it in ano other room or something? Nee but it it specifically says it's uh the the control is lost in the same room. So Well a beeping device would be Uh furthermore the learning time is a problem. Uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it's it's too uh too difficult to learn. So the the learning curve should be very short uh for the dumbest people should be able to use it. Yeah but people don't read manuals. No. I think you should put more time in the in the design of uh pick up and use  than a manual. Yeah. Right. And it should be consistent with consistent with older remotes. Alright. And we don't have much time. So it's better to uh put our attention to the the design. So you can pick up and use it  than I think. Yeah right  right. Next point. Um R_S_I_. Well that's about twenty per cent I thought. But uh the designer should uh take it uh should uh Wie zeg ik dat? Yeah  consider the consequences of using your remote. It should be a good in your hand. Right  this is the most important part. Um  we're Like the requirements said  we're gonna specify of we're gonna target a younger audience. Um  that's about sixty per cent of the market  so it's uh quite important. Um research shows that they like to have a little L_C_D_ screen on their on their uh zapping uh device. Uh I thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty  ninety nine per cent of uh the people like that. So it's very important we should definitely have that in our uh designs. Yeah but they think it's really important. So if we want to s If we have a big If we make lots of uh of the stuff  maybe we can uh buy it very cheap  I dunno. We have to uh Yeah  I don't know. I don't have any information on that. So Right. And uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition. They also like that  but research is very uh costly. So Yeah  but it it might be important for the sale. Well I do think L_C_D_ is more reachable than the speech recognition. So we might consider L_C_D_ screens. Alright. Alright. Um  I think that's it. Um I think it is sensible to u uh to take this take these points into the notes. So you can Right. Yeah. Right. Alright. Next button. Oh right. Purple. Yeah  yeah  yeah. A bit. Maybe you can select it. So it uh inverts. the p the whole picture. Nah  uh never mind. Yeah. Alright. Right. Can I say something? Um I have a table here about uh the l the relevance of the buttons. Uh the power button is used very much  channel selection  volume and teletext. Well teletext is not an option  so that uh But I think it's very important to make um the power  channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb  so you can't have R_S_I_ uh consequences. Right. Make them big  make them easy to uh to press. Right. Yeah  right. Right. Yeah  that's right. That's right. That's right. We But Yeah. That's very important. And But is that is that useable? Do people  uh when they pick up a remote  know that they have to do that? It's a f it's a new feature  you can make make a double feature l like a button on the top and under it. Yeah  he feels it immediately. Yeah  that's right. Yeah. Right  continue. Sorry. Yeah  that's right. Alright. Alright. Yeah  it's clear. I dunno. I think uh w About twenty minutes ago? Losing time losing time. Yeah right. So I don't think so. Yeah right. These are already in use? Alright  okay. Well Yeah  me too. Mm. But we have to reject that  because of the requirements? Alright. Yeah  right. Yeah. But it Yeah  that's right. Yeah  that's a must. We must have that. We can make a symbol of the company right here. And if you put a front on it  there's a hole on the front. So the symbol's always on Yeah. Yeah  yeah. But let's not focus on the front. Alright. Yeah  I agree. I've I've got another point. Um there are two target audi audiences  and we've uh chose for the younger one. Um  research has shown that um it's a high interested uh in features. They are high high interested in feature. But they are more critical. Fo Yeah  critical. So The younger audience. So we must um must design uh a control that really speaks to the people. Mm-hmm. Clip aren't used much. Yeah right. Yeah but Yeah. Here  look at these numbers. The newest features are  like I said  are uh L_C_D_ and uh speech uh control. Our audience  these people  are very like these uh features. You see? So we must build in something  or they will to uh go to the concurrent. The concurrent? Competitors  right. So  I do think we have to uh have some features. Even though they cost a little more. Right. Right. Like a ticker-tape. Which programme you are l watching or something. Yeah  right. Yeah right. No not clickable. Nah  no no no. Yeah  just at at the top. So when you s you sit like this you can can watch. I think it should be at the top. Yeah right. It's a ticker-tape idea. Well it's just one script. Yeah  five minutes of ja ja for programming. So I don't think that's the issue. Alright  we go with the L_C_D_ screen? 'Kay. Right  I don't know if I can find that  but Next time. Yeah right. Yeah  I understand what you're saying. We should have a general idea of how it's gonna look. Right. At the top. I think the top is more uh When you s How do you zap? You just sit in your chair? With the remote? Yeah but that's where your hand ball might be. Yeah  I dunno. We'll draw two  and then we'll see uh No Um he thinks Yeah  right. He thinks it's better to put the L_C_D_ at the bottom  and I think it's better at the top. But your Yeah. The the ticker The L_C_D_ is like like small. It's it's wide. It's not not high. But Yeah right. But We're making a remote with with a few functions you know. We High-tech. Width. Th that's not a problem. When I draw here it Oh. Huh? Yeah  it's off. It it needs to be calibrated again. Well Where? Alright  we have to make a decision now  because we don't have much time. Um I think we have uh a few functions  and we can put uh the L_C_D_ above it  and still have lots of room at the bottom  where you can put your hand. At the bot So We are two uh V_S_ two. Right. Great. And moreover I think that you two should be uh come to consensus about the L_C_D_ s. It's uh your it's your job. Yeah  right. Alright  let's keep it central. Mm. Right. You should put that uh power button  channel and volume should have the most uh importance. Yeah  but what he said about R_S_I_ was t kinda true. When when you uh put them all in the same place  the most used buttons  you're doing the same thing all the time  and that's just what R_S_I_'s all about. So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other. Um Frequency of uh button use. Um channels are uh most uh is most used within the hour. You can see. So the the channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart  I think  up and down. You thinking uh about R_S_I_? Y look at uh look at the frequency. Nei not too much  but Nei nei nei n I I totally agree. But just Yeah. Right. Yeah. I agree. And should and should be red. Right  just make some decisions. The most important things we have to uh I do think you have to keep you have to keep it central now. Just uh you decide that  you decide that  and ready. Yeah. Nei. We're No We're deciding now  so Top or bottom? Okay. Yeah  right. Okay. Yeah  okay. No. Do you still have the pictures over there? Yeah  that's about it. You do need the uh multi Or did uh No  like this one. You do need them? Yeah  I know. But are we Alright  alright uh Now okay. Right. Yeah  it's most useable this way. Yeah. Right. I do think we have to put that underneath a clip. Yeah. Okay  right. Well if you you take those th If you Yeah  but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh Yeah  but when you zap down zero you get to A_V_. Ah uh well whatever . Yeah  but if we're choosing to uh incorporate these buttons  you have to have uh channel setting  if you wa if you have a new T_V_. You have to set the channels. Right all th these uh different buttons you have to Ah  I do. Right. That's the only one we put uh in there. For a screen uh fu uh channel setting. Programme  right. Uh Ah. Great. Alright. Ah. Okay. Get into my belly. Mm. Well  yeah. No. Oh. We have forty minutes for this uh discussion? Alright. Huh? Yeah. Mm-hmm  now it's right. It's meant to be easily wiped out  yeah. Mm-hmm. I I disagree  but uh it's not uh t it's not my place to disagree I guess. Oh  alright. Yeah  we are a real fashionable company. I read uh I read it on the I didn't know what company we were  but we we design uh especially trendy uh trendy trendy stuff. So it has to be uh a modern design. That's important to know  uh when you design a thing of course. Yeah. The order? No. You can zap away. Yeah. Oh. Oh? Mm-hmm. I think our uh user uh expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote  of course. Uh I didn't read it? Oh  alright. users to uh add one? Do you think? Mm-hmm. Yeah alright. Because they don't use it? Alright. Well maybe for the If you don't recognise a button who d who d who do I call uh wh when I don't know it? Isn't it part of the of the u No. No. Never mind. Consider the m Yeah. Mm-hmm. It's going to be expensive. Yeah. Well we'll uh consider it uh. We'll think abo we'll think No  we'll look we'll look into that later. Alright? We have very demanding clients. Yeah  yeah  alright. Well we'll consider both and and see what uh what what we can find  I think. We don't rule them out uh yet. Shall I give a technical talk? Alright. Well uh it is my task to uh explain uh or to point out a working design. We have that here. Okay  how do you enlarge it  so that you can have the F_ F_ five. Yep. Well  the working design  that's my uh Well alright uh  you know who I am and what I do. So uh we have this. It's a bit uh unclear because I wanted to copy paste something. It was originally in black and white but it became black and purple. But I think you can read it. Um well um I think it's important uh for you to realise the basic function of a remote control. Uh well you can see uh And I then can select I can select on the dings It goes to the next page. Well  you can read it  it's not too difficult. Meanwhile  this is a schematic uh um view of uh how a basic remote control works. You have uh basically uh the energy  the power of the of the remote control  uh and the sender  w which is the LED  the the the the the the the the the bulb that sends the the infrared beam to the  no  to the set. And uh the source is of course the user. Uh the user interface is um uh the the the buttons of course. And the the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip  and the chip uh sends it to the LED  and the LED sends it to the receiver. That's the that's the basic idea. Very basic. Um well I have uh uh put it in a in in in a a couple of basic steps. Uh the remote uh is basically just waiting for a user to press a key. It does nothing until uh of course uh the key is pressed. The key a signal to a chip  uh the chip senses the connection. uh and recognise the key. So well you understand. The chip uh produces Morse code  um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed  of course. And it uses transistors in the in the remote control to amplify and to send uh that signal again to the to the LED  which is the bulb  of course. Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the  well it's uh very simple  and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the T_V_ set  and the T_V_ set uh also recognises the the the signal  and performs the assigned task. Ah bu Yeah  but we don't. Uh we No no  but Yeah. Exactly. Uh well this is uh the basic uh function of a remote. I've some couple of pictures here. It's a very basic one. And uh if we if we're going to add an uh an uh L_C_D_ screen to it  it uh won't look anything like this  but This is very basic uh basically the the shape of um of a remote control. It has uh very little buttons and But it it uh it's it's quite um Yeah  you can easily recognise the buttons. They're uh far enough apart and an anything. It's not very um uh not very high-tech uh indeed  and it's not very user-friendly. Uh if you look at the shape  it's uh just a simple long box uh shape. So we have to uh change a little bit uh to that  uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly  and that uh problems like uh R_S_I_ and uh those kinds of thing don't don't oc don't occur. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah  because they are the the most important buttons and you can immediately You don't have to look and and search for them. Well you you can't have any uh every button under the thumb  of course. Yeah. Well . But in e in any case the the basic function should be uh indeed  and as you say at the thumb. I think that's a good idea  and uh and that the less important uh buttons  like the the the different channels  uh the numbers one two three four five as well  should be uh yeah well not in reach  because uh they don't use it uh all the time. Well it's uh pretty pretty basically uh as you said. And I have some pictures of the inside workings  but uh I don't want to get too technical  because uh that's not uh very uh useful for you. So yeah exactly this is uh how it uh looks from the inside. And uh well that's about it I think. Oh yeah  I still have this. Oh I had to delete this  but I had to make a schematic uh of the of the new But I had too too little time  but uh don't uh don't look at it please. I I think it's it's clear uh how it works. Alright. That's the most important thing. Alright. Uh Right. Yeah  uh there are different uh We have all have different home pages  with different links. Yeah. Mm-hmm. You can't really see uh the differ from different sides. But I think uh Uh you can draw it if you Yeah. We can put it on the on the back side. Yeah  so that you don't replace the symbol  yeah. Mm-hmm. Mike  uh can you put uh that picture from me on the in the Word documents file? In Map? The younger uh Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I think uh the most functions uh underneath that uh uh No um mm usually But Yeah I think m most Most uh Mm-hmm. Uh. Yeah. Our competitor. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So it it just signals the the different uh sig uh the different symbols on the screen you have  uh because if you change to s channel two you have two on the screen and two on your on your um on your L_C_D_ screen. But should it uh really be uh clickable  uh or or just integrate inside to try to make it d more trendy. But that's of course uh a bit more uh expensive than uh the basic uh calculator design  with the scrolling text and that kind of thing. Alright. Shouldn't we start with the most important parts? The L_C_D_ screen alright but we should start with the power button? Uh Huh? And then uh Maybe we should uh centralise the discussion here. I dunno what uh you were talking about but we are busy with something. Uh-huh. Why do you think it's better at the bottom? But you just can put uh the the the the the whole interface a bit down  so that there's room for the for the interface. Uh-huh. And and we can Bottom. Well that's a bit exaggerated. Well  I agree with you. It's it's also more recognisable. It looks more like a calculator to people  if you have the l the the the thing on top. Yeah w well  but uh you don't have to throw uh um important aspe important aspect like familiarity uh completely away  uh because I think it's uh I think it's still important to have it at the top  because it's uh it's more familiar that way. A little a little bit. Maybe you should another pen. Maybe that's uh better. You e you only have one pen for that screen. Yeah. Yeah. I I agree. Well I'm the I I'm the designer  so um Yeah. Uh we uh we were busy with that. Uh yeah we should uh summon the the different uh aspects of the thing. So  we have the power button. Yeah of course. Uh it's uh. Yeah. W wh While you have to agree  I can say it's like this and you must agree. Yeah. Channel  yeah. Volume control. Um Well let's look at your uh design. Uh Uh-huh. Yeah. But th th on this remote th these controls are for something else  a D_V_D_ player or something. So Yeah  it's it's also not good to completely stay in one position constantly with one hand. Y Yeah. It's good to move uh from time to time. Yeah. No but now y W would we have to choose a way in middle? Mm-hmm. Oh. Far apart? I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together  but you don't have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together. Yeah. C c can you make you make We can use uh the drawing board now  I think. Uh it it doesn't work well but But it it would be pretty pretty uh nice if we could just draw a simple thing. Mm. Alright. Well uh yeah I I still think it's it's quite important though to uh to have it at the top  so Yeah. You say familiarity isn't important but Yeah d Yeah. As we we we we agreed  we do have a L_C_D_. So that's that's enough. Yeah. There's one two three four five six six seven eight nine zero. Oh  like that. Um They'd recognise it. Th that's the most That that's very easy. Yeah. I think these are the the most important functions. basic function. Oh yeah. Uh just two just two under uh under uh I I think uh But you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section. Uh that's that's too complicated. You can just put it somewhere They they aren't used much  not as much as those other  so you can put it somewhere Yeah s bit smaller and s Well uh and and I think more at the bottom. Yeah. Yeah or at the top  yeah. What do you think uh those those buttons? Above or down? And w where? Well we design it later. We have it  and we design later where everything goes. Yeah. The the video channel uh? No no not always. Ze yeah zero is a different channel than uh the the video channel. But it's easy to go If you are at uh at channel uh fifty five and you want to uh go immediately to the video channel  you do you have to push a to to get below zero. It's more easy to get to uh where the specific uh video channel button. Yeah well uh d different screen settings a Yeah  sk Yeah y you you you you have screen width. Yeah to uh oh yeah of course to configure the programme the Yeah. Yeah. You should Yeah. I think that's important. Uh And and the settings to change the brightness the settings to change the brightness and the contrast. Channel  yeah. Chief? Chief? Th the menu menu button is also important. Then you can uh Where? I don't see it. Oh Menu  alright. In the menu. And you can uh then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something. Because uh the zapping buttons aren't used then if you are in the menu. Yeah. Or the volume  yeah. Yes chief. Yeah this is this is your thing. I am hungry. See you later mate. Mm. Oh. Oh. Oh  that's a shame. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. No. I don't think Yeah. Yes you should You should could take a look at it and and and know how it how it's supposed to work. Yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control  I think. Yeah right. It sh it should be there  the manual. But but not to explain how the remote works. Only Hmm. No. I think that's uh difficult to realise also. No and we have customers in multiple uh countries I think. Yeah. No. Oh you go. Yeah  go ahead. High tech. You can also like Yeah  I was thinking you can Are some of the the the um Maybe you can make  for for channel changing  two little buttons on the side of the remote  so you can just do like this. Like some uh little uh Gameboy things or some Hmm? Well Yeah alright  but Yeah  but if you s say them up and down  they they'll understand it  I think. Eighty per cent would. Yeah that's true. Yeah but Mm. Well I thought um everybody on the website uh would see the same thing  but obviously that's not the case. Yeah. For instance you couldn't see this. Um Yeah. Well I'm Mike  User Interface Designer. The the method? Well I used my own experience with remotes  took a good l look uh at the remotes on the corporate website  which are these two. Um Yes  these are from from another uh manufacturer. Um This one is engineering-centred  so this one has the most functions and um things. This one is user-centred. Um I like user-centr centred uh uh also the best. Um Well  I thought uh that we uh reduce the the option to control the D_V_D_ also  and teletext and that kind of stuff. Uh so I thought we we we would use more or need more buttons than this one. But Yes. Th that's why this mm is not relevant any more I feel. Um I think this is about the maximum number of buttons uh we'll need. I um I kinda like the shape. I think this is what we talked about. But No I've Well I showed it somewhere. Um Oh yeah. I think we should go further with the idea of a removable front. So we can can uh yeah customise the Mm? Yeah. It's a front. It's not the the whole remote that changes  of course. You can Mm. Or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote. So l like Ericsson does every uh S something like this. It's recognisable. Um Yeah? Yeah yeah. Something like that  in the Yeah. Yeah. Um Well so uh uh like I said I thought we'd we'd use more function. If we we had to include more functions. But we don't. So um Yeah. I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we need. Maybe some less. Like eject we don't need  and some other buttons we don't need. I think uh Yeah  I will. I think uh for the remote um uh less is more. The less buttons the better the design. Um We should go with that concept I think. I know. Mm. Yeah  but what kind of features? Like L_C_D_ screens and voice recognition. But I've Yeah  that's nice. Yeah  we should keep that simple too. It will No  it should be uh integrated. I think Yeah  something like on um some radios in car. You Where it's  yeah  walking to Yeah. Wa Yeah. Yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost. Or maybe you will get that information uh Yeah. At the top or at the bottom? Yeah but Yeah but with with the L_C_D_ screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural. 'Cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom. Yeah  no Mm. Uh well because most uh remotes have um some space left at the bottom  and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody. I c Well I d I think that's that's ugly but I th Yeah. Power button always Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  y you gotta zap like this or you want to Yeah. Yeah you don't want You want uh Yeah it it it must be a remote. Yeah. At the bottom? In a few minutes Oh yeah  oh yeah  I totally agree. Yeah. He's the boss. No it's our job. For all of us I think. The ten numbers? Yeah? Volume? I think we we should use something like this um to um The the channel up and channel down button? Yeah  in circle  you know? And and a volume control also in it. Yes  as I already said  we could drop some of these buttons. Yeah. I think these should be in one big circle in the middle. Yeah but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place. They they need to be centred. Volume hardly. No I don't think. Yeah but Yeah but No. The other the other two uh frustrations are far more important. So Well they are used four times an hour  so Power bu button should be left at the top. Mm. Yeah. Well consensus  um We we can put it in the middle  so Alright. No. Well just when you push a one one and No  if you On most T_V_s if you uh press two numbers shortly after each other  d it Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We we can make make uh a little row of like four buttons down here. Or at Yeah alright then. Oh  they can be small or round like buttons. Why go to video? That's just zero. Yeah. Yeah  but you can can zap down Yes  I think th No  then you press ninety nine. I think go to video is an irrelevant button  but Yeah well y you must have. Yeah you yeah you have one one button from s set frequency o or something  and then with plus and min minus you can uh adjust the uh Yeah  alright. I think things like uh contrast and brightness should be um in the menu  yeah. Yeah  the Or the volume or something like that. Your pen. I thought we'd uh lunch uh right now  or not? Yeah  lunch break. ,This last meeting started with the presentation of a remote control prototype. It has on-off and volume buttons  an LCD screen (it can be active or switched off) in various colours  which largely replaces the use of push buttons  and a jog-wheel for navigation and option selection in the menus presented on the LCD. It also includes speech recognition as an alternative interface  which also serves as mechanism for locating the device. It was designed to be powered by a single battery. The casing will be made of titanium with rubber strawberries following the fruit and veg fashion. The prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad) in terms of fancifulness  technology  robustness  usefulness  size  colour and shape and customizability: the average mark was 2.17; the team were satisfied with their prototype  although after costs were calculated it proved very expensive. Finally  the team evaluated the whole process: they deemed themselves a good team  they found there was plenty of room for creativity and they liked the project manager's leadership. 
Welcome back. Welcome back everybody. So this meeting agenda will be the detailed design meeting. And uh opening and uh P_M_s of the meet minutes  uh prototype presentation from uh Christine and uh Agnes. Yes and uh evaluation criteria. The finance  it's uh from my side  from the management  and uh production evaluation. Then uh closing. So we have forty minutes to discuss and uh finalise and close the product and project and to move further  okay  so Okay  let's talk about uh maybe first uh for the prototype. So I handle to So shall I go to sorry. Yep. S Okay  let's go to A_M_I_. So in two or three or Yeah. Yes. Mm-hmm. I think the microphone is on on the top  uh on the middle  the under the flip. So that will be the safe  so p any the chip it's not on the chip because you need to have microphone to Yes. Uh it's it's Yeah  but uh uh my opinion I think it's better under the flip because whenever you want to uh the talk  okay  so then you can speak then you can close it. But if you put it on the on the flip  okay  then uh technical I don't think it's uh feasible  'cause most of the time you speak then it will be recognised. Yeah  the sides maybe is good. So That's good idea. Yes. So it's maybe good idea. Yes. Yeah. So it's maybe good idea. S s Okay. S I'm fine  I'm satisfi I'm satisfied. Of course it's it's it's looks more heo heavy  but I think when it's completely maybe it's a less weight. Yes. Yep. That's your uh prototype model? Okay  that's good  thank you very much. So any comments or uh Okay. Yes  that uh So I'll come back to the So evaluation criteria  I think uh that will be good  so then let's come to the finance uh  I have some uh calculations which I made uh as for uh the budget. So here you can uh look like uh the energy and uh dynamo and uh kinetic and solar cells. Uh it's optional  somewhat optional and Ed wants the chip on print  that's what uh we were talking about that. So then we have sample sensor and sample speaker  then uh we have the wood material  then special colour and push button. So it's uh actually  our budget was uh twelve point five Euro  but uh it's coming to nine point nine five Euro  so we are under uh below the budget  okay  so still we are saving some money. I think it's a good figure. Than thank you. So maybe it's for some money we can utilise for our uh marketing  for the sales  okay  and uh It's not. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes  so still uh we have twelve point five Euro. Yes. Yeah  but Yes. Yep. Yes. This we are talking about one unit  okay  so when it go into the quantity  okay  and the cost will come down. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. But anyhow  still we are under control  okay  so what uh I will do is I will try to negotiate with the vendors  okay  to get uh the production cost less  okay  so then we can save some money  okay  to put into th our marketing or uh you know the promotions  whatever  okay  so that uh I will look after. I will speak to the management and how to get uh you know some more uh cost down. Yes. You're in four? TrendWatch. Okay. Yep. Mm-hmm. Yes. Mm-hmm. Yep. Yes. Yep. Of course. Yep. Yep. Yes. Yes. To the agents. Yes. Or eBay  or Yes. Yeah  that's a good idea. To impro more profit and uh Yeah  yes. Yeah. We can. I don't think that's uh not possible  it's uh okay then  l uh let's wait for the production  okay  then uh you can evaluate the product  so how it looks like technically and uh how it look like uh the real. T Oh but Yes it's it's very quick  of course. It will uh come back in two weeks  okay  it will be ready in two weeks. For evaluation  okay. Yes  the prototype uh prototype product evaluation. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah. So you can take a minimum two weeks to a maximum four weeks. Yeah. Yeah  because we we are not going to do it in uh our factory  okay  so we can give it a product evalua Yes  yes. So we'll do it in the other place  and I don't think it's take more than four weeks time. Or uh Okay  so then the real production we will start once we product evaluation  okay  then uh it's approve from uh the technical team and uh your team  okay  uh from the management  then we can launch in the market. Hm? S Any any other uh questions or uh comments to be discuss? Okay  so then uh Okay uh  let's take like this. Let's proceed with this model  okay  for the for the marketing direction  okay. So no more changes will be made  okay  in this the basic design. Okay? So we will introduce m this model and uh let's introduce in the market and let's take the feedback from the customers  then we can uh go for the second generation. Okay. There's no end  there's not limit. Every every custom Okay. Well  every customer  okay  they have their own ideas  they have their own test  okay  so there's no end  there's no limit. Yeah  so that's the reason you are here for uh the design  okay  I hope you made a good design. Yeah  but uh see  we ought to take a few considerations  okay  one is the price consideration  one is future consideration  okay  like uh you can eat uh you can all eat more chi I can eat more chilli  okay  so i it's a depends on the individual taste  you know  so we have we have to balance somewhere. Yes. Yeah. The sports time. Football. Football. Yes. Yes. Yes. Research. Yep. Yes. Yes  the that of course uh I will convince the management to do that  okay. Sure  sure  yes.. Yeah. That's the reason Ed is here. I think he can promote the the brand value and the product value. Yes. We are behind the scene and he is the front screen  so. He's on the big screen. Okay  so then uh let's come to the closing and uh are the costs within the budget and uh is the product evaluated  okay  so that will uh come soon. Okay for uh but our time being  so thanks for all your efforts and great work and uh great design and uh let's leave it to the Ed for later for once production is over and the meantime let's celebrate. So let's meet up uh this evening to hang up for some party. 'S good. Thank you. Thank you again for all. And see you in the evening for drinks. I'm sorry to be late. Agnes  yes. Uh thank you  so you did a PowerPoint presentation  good for you. Um and uh I could Yeah the d We haven't um uh specified where the speaker or the microphone will be placed. That depends on the uh s design of the circuit board inside and uh what room is left um Yes  okay. Uh-huh. No  I mean it depends on the design of the circuit board. Maybe I've got my hand in the popcorn bowl and I'm holding my cup of Coca-Cola in the other hand. Mm-hmm. Yeah  y better you pass it around with a napkin. It's um It's um You need to work on the weight a little bit. We're glad you're satisfied. Mm-hmm. Yes  great I I'm surprised. Congratulations. Oh  okay. It's gonna cost a long way to c you know  cost a lot of money to market it  is it? Thirty. Yeah. So that means we can put the uh the L_C_D_ in  yeah. Although customisation  because this is being done  you know  the on on-order basis  it might be uh the the quantity won't m won't uh the circuit board will b you're right  would be in producing quantity  but the cost of the case would uh be fixed at the Uh you got some pretty cheap labour that can do this case for one Euro. That's really that's the cost of the material and lab wow  that's really outstanding. Is this the same one you did before? Okay. Yeah  no kidding. Mayb maybe they already expected something. Could could I go to findings? Uh uh um I would uh like to explore the possibility of using um alternative um delivery and sales channel which would be um to use the internet for promotion and ordering and then to drop-ship the p product to the customer's residence. That way you have no storage  you have no um you do have transportation  still have the labour cost  but you don't have the transport to the uh point of sale. The point of sale is online. Right  like Amazon. In fact  we should sell through Amazon  don't you think? Or eBay  yeah. There's an idea. Going with um Ah  we we're do you know  selling a unique product uh. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. And you can even have an a movie that you can rotate the object and look at the di the only thing that you're missing really is the weight. Mm. We're getting used to that. It's not quite like trying on a shoe  but people are getting used to buying things online that they can't touch before buying. Uh-huh. Great. Works for me. Prototypes  you mean. In um We probably should do some market tests uh once we have the prototypes and do some orders and things like that and test-market it. Any outstanding? No  I'm go ahead. Did you have something? Second generation. Our project doesn't um Ed  d do you know what season of the year or time of the year is the most important for T_V_ remote control sales? Would it be the Christmas season by any chance? Sports season. Which sport season? So so maybe what So I think what we need to do is perhaps to synchronise the final the the launch of a user-tested device with some special event. And and then um so that gives us a little more time perhaps then we anticipated  because I don't know when the World Cup is  but I'm sure there's gonna be one. Or another m major sports event. Probably not the um the football games coming up the end of January. I think that might be a little too aggressive um  but  so  I'm just ig uh pointing out a uh a strategy to uh do some additional user testing pri and then to launch um at a a major sports event or uh perhaps to uh also And to work with motion pictures. There might be some motion pictures that are coming out um that are coming out on D_V_D_ that uh they need to have a m special remote control to work with it  so we could maybe work out a campaign with uh with Sony Pictures for example. Maybe some management has got uh relationships there we can leverage. That's great. Disposable diapers is an example of that in fact. Yes  it is one of the first consumer products that was launched about thirty years that was a disposable consumer product  and uh people the market hadn't really gotten on to the concept that you could use something and then throw it away  'cause it wasn't uh but then when they re-launched them thirty years later  they were virtually the same design  but people had gotten the throw-away  you know  paper cups and napki y all kinds of things that they hadn't um so  you're right  timing is very important  but I think we've got a good product. That's right. It's gonna be very important to the company. Good luck  Ed. You look very relaxed  considering h you know  the uh the weight on your shoulders  yeah. Sounds good. Thank you. Nice working with you. Probably. Technical pa I would think. Ha. I don't wanna say. Louder. Yeah. Can also be on the side. No  because y you can easily put a microphone on the side that would have no problem would haven't been not be damaged or anything  and it'd be accessible all the time to voice. Yeah. Compliments to the artist. Uh. Well  the prototype is is very well within the design and ideas that we've we've talked about on the previous meetings. Now it goes into this next phase as the financial uh marketing uh Well we haven't come to mine yet  so we're gonna have a bit of difference of opinion  yes. Well  it just depends on if we're gonna add a o on this pr provisionary cost analysis  we do not have a L_C_ display. L_C_ display is gonna be very expensive  it's gonna be It's not it doesn't say. We don't have the price up there  okay  so if we add approximately two to three Euro per remote  now we're up around about twelve  twelve and a half as to what uh the company had initially uh requested. Um Display in. But as far as production um I'm putting up a question because we're talking about profit also  and in mine you'll see uh the problem with uh our survey  the p the possibility that how many units can be sold  what percentage of the market  etcetera etcetera because that has to be taken in into consideration. Uh this is just production cost  it is not uh advertising cost  it's not transportation cost uh And that will inflate quite a bit the cost of the uh the cost of the unit for the company. So to come up with what the company wants is a fifty million Pound profit  we're gonna have to go a long ways. Yes. Slightly. It's gonna be very hard to reduce. That's not bad. If we can go to to my display. And we'll come back to yours just to give everybody an idea of the market. So now I'm gonna scare everybody out of this project. If I'm still here. Yep. The four gives me it's gotta be uh TrendWatch. No. It shouldn't be if it's not it's not the right one. No  no we g no  that's the same one. You have to go back and find another one. Whatever name it popped up under. Uh functional  try functional  it might not be it either  but we'll see. Yep  that's it. So we'll go screen by screen. Although since uh we need to have some type of idea on a market uh we had independent study that says it this this market has an availability to absorb eight mi eight million units per year. Okay? Our internal company evaluation puts it between eight to nine million which is approximately the same as the independent study. So if we continue  we'll look at the findings. Next screen. Which means that uh if we have a target of two million would the company has to take twenty five percent of the market in the first year  which is actually a tremendous amount. No kidding  yeah. So  if we put an inflated price of fifty Euro at a production cost that cannot exceed twenty-five Euro  okay  we're already in that that price  okay  with transport  promotion  labour  because we hav gi included the promotion in the cost  transport for the material to the stores or whatever how however we're gonna break this down between our our retailers. Twenty-five percent of the market to get to two million units. At two million units  we have to have a profit of twenty-five Euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit Eu Euro profit. Okay? So  obviously we w w I just did a run down the evaluation of the form  the fan uh the fancy stylishness of the of the unit  the ease of use  speech recognition  cost  we've gone through these. Now  the company must evaluate the feasibility of being able to take enough of the market to justify in production. Or we project this over two years  but being that the market changes very very quickly  maybe there's no more interest in buying this thing in eighteen months from now. So  now we have to come up with a decision. Can the company sell two million units? Can it sell it for fifty Euros? S Upscale technology. Well. There are several companies that have gone that way. Weight  the feel of the product  but There are several that have gone through with the watches  too. You can customise a watch  you can see how it is at the f at the end of the production  you can change it uh There's a lot of online that's that is doing this now. And when you're rotating  you'll look behind and look this way uh it's possible to do with this  maybe there's a possibility of selling more than two million units in one year  which could you know  feasibili feasibility uh lower the price of the unit. Well  obviously. Mm that'd have to be thrown out on the market for people to get an idea  to see get get their I think we pretty much covered everything. Well  then it may not be. Like people don't like wood. very specific. Hmm. Right before the Eur the World Cup. World soccer. World Cup soccer  they need those things that they have their hands g occupied and they need to be able to talk to the con remote control. Or any major sports. Yeah  I'm the one who takes the heat. If it's a flop  it's the marketer. Yes. Yes. Stress. Celebration. Very good. Thank you very much. Bye-bye. Yep  okay  see you later on. Yeah. Thanks. Mm  okay. I've done a presentation  but it pretty much covers work that we've both done  so if I'm missing anything  Christine can just correct me. It's not the biggest PowerPoint presentation in the world  but Three. Um. No it's think it's the last one. No  then this is the la yeah  that one  final design. It is named appropriately  you just couldn't see the name. Um okay  can I have the mouse? Thanks. Alright  so from when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting  we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape  the material that we chose was wood  and uh the colour would be customisable  'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour. Um  so in terms of function  you have to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off  volume and channel control  menu control  voice recognition control  and we've incorporated the L_C_D_ screen on the flip panel as part of the design  if we figure out it's too expensive  well then you just take it off. Um  so to unveil our lovely product. This is our remote control  with the flip panel as you can see. So if you lift up the panel  you can see the lovely yellow L_C_D_ display. Um  this is actually hard to do. The yellow button you have is the on off button  so it's really big  hard to miss. You have the the red um triangles are the toggles for changing the volume. So up volume up  down volume down. The green are the channel changing. S And it's one of those very light  very touchable displays. And then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom  and on the right-hand side you have the access to the menu on the T_V_  and on the left-hand side you have the the the ability to turn off the voice recognition. So this is pretty much what we had on the white board the last time. So. Oh yes. Additional feature on the back is that you can have your own customised backing and I suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on the front. So that you can really make this a highly highly customisable remote control. Yeah. But it shouldn't be under the flip either  because you can have the remote control closed  but you still might want to activate it by voice. But if you've already got the remote control in your hand you need to open the flip to use the voice  why use the voice  why not just use your hand? I mean the whole point of the voice is that if the remote control is sitting there and I'm too lazy to reach over and pick it up  I can just use my voice. Yeah. And you don't wanna let go of either one. I mean it doesn't have to be on the flip  it can be on the side somewhere. Yeah. So  I mean I can pass this around if anyone wants to Yeah. Yeah  exactly. Yes. And maybe the shape of the buttons  the little egg shapes aren't the most economical  but Yeah. I mean this is plasticene. There's only so much you can do. We could have possibly made it a lot thinner as well. But And part of the thing is m a lot of people say that they don't like something that's too light  because they don't feel like they have enough control over it. So I mean maybe this is excessively heavy  but I think it needs to have some weight  it needs to feel like you're still holding something. So that's pretty much it for our presentation actually. Yeah. No we do  but it's not filled in. It's number thirty. Oh  yeah  yeah  you're right  sorry  yes. Um-hmm. Yes. That's no  I think it's the same one. Functional. It looks like it  there's S Yeah. Um-hmm. Mm. I was thinking the same thing  yeah. Directly. Um-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. You can do a shipping centre somewhere  or strategically place shipping centres to minimise distance costs. Yeah. That actually makes more sense if we're gonna make it so highly customisable  'cause on the web people can look at the different options they have  see maybe what other people have done  what the range of possibility as  whereas if you're in a store  you can't unless you're a highly imaginative person  you may not really know what it is you want  whereas on the web  if you have a bunch of pictures  it can sort of trigger ideas and Yeah. The weight and feel. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yes. Mm-hmm. What turnaround time do we have? 'Cause I mean production evaluation can be very very quick or very very long. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Think minimum two weeks if we're gonna develop prototypes and then try to take them to different places and see how people use it's not a trivial task. No no. We definitely shouldn't do it in our factory. What ab Well I was just wondering about if we're gonna do a product evaluation then what about time for redesign if the users come back and tell us no this is bad  this is bad  we want this done differently. The problem is there might not be a second generation if the first generation flops for some silly reason that we haven't thought of. No  but there's a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and fine-tuned to suit a general range of requirements versus releasing a product that we think will work but we don't really have anything to back it up. Yes  but I'm not everybody. I mean the whole point of user evaluation is to see what real people need. We have our own motivations in mind  we have our own ideas in mind  but that doesn't mean that that's what's gonna sell. Yeah  of course. I'm just trying to point out that I think that your evaluation and redesign turnaround time is too short well you have no redesign not you personally  but in the project we have no redesign time and Yeah. Yeah  that's a good idea. Yeah. Mm-hmm. That's actually good place to advertise it too. Yeah. Mm-hmm. It's just something to to keep in mind  'cause it's really really important. A lot of products have gone out there without being properly user-tested and completely flopped  when in fact it gets re-released a few years down the line with proper testing and it takes off like crazy. Really? That I didn't know. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Exactly. Okay. Thanks. Bye. ,For the conceptual design  the marketing expert talked about the public's preference for looks over technological innovation; however  they both seem to be more important than ease of use. The current fashion among younger people favours bright colours and fruit and vegetable themes and spongy materials: pertinent exchangeable fronts can express such trends on the remote  and could also provide themes for other target groups. They could also add some rubber to provide easy grip of the device. Cases can be flat  single- or double-curved. They can be made of plastic  rubber  wood or titanium. Hand or kinetic dynamos  batteries  and solar cells can be used as energy sources. Possible interfaces are push buttons  scroll wheels  and LCDs. A way to make this device different would be to use a scroll-wheel on the side with integrated button for volume control and mute. Speech recognition can be implemented by adding a sample sensor and speaker on the remote. The final decisions also included combined battery with solar cells. The team will design a single-curved device with a scroll wheel and speech recognition  in black and yellow  the company colours. 
Mm. So  uh now it's the Hi Sammy. It's the detail design meeting  so we're going last meeting. So um  first uh Mark and Rama are going to present uh the prototype. Uh then uh Sammy will propose some uh crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype. Then  w we And then we going to do some finance to see if uh it is uh feasible and uh at the end we will we will um evaluate ourself as a team. And that's all. Okay. So first  let's uh see the prototype. Okay. And you have some slides then? Yeah. Mm. Okay. Uh so in which uh Mm okay. Mm. Mm-hmm. MASA? Okay. What do you say? One day. He Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Bobby. Mm-hmm. Hmm. 'Kay. Are colourful. Yeah. Ho-ho. That's for the L_C_D_ or for the titanium? Mm-mm. Hey  you know you're theme today. Hmm. And w wait  wh what are the strawberries for? Wh wh Mm-hmm. Okay. Strawberries. Ah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Uh we'll see in the financial part if uh all gets into W Who is the five uh fifty millions we first make a party in? Mm-hmm. Okay. Uh  so Let's uh  yeah  let's see if uh th it's meet the evaluation criterium. Oops. Okay. Mm-hmm. Uh  I think that fancy  we can say it is fancy. Oh. I am not the d the only one choosing  yeah. Uh what do you think? Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. It's in the other. Yeah. Mm. Two. Let's say two  yeah. Change colour of t Yeah  I think it's a Yeah. Yeah. Mm-mm. Um The strawberries Oh. Mm-mm. Yeah. But it's too. It's um robust  yeah. Oh  yeah  lets me try. Yeah. What is uh next  please? And you can uh do di two sites? Yeah. Okay  also. You can  by using the You c push here the the yeah. Let me understand well  because I'm not sure that's for that this one are b d uh two dir directional button. Yeah  two Yeah. Yeah. And which what is that? Okay  okay. It's a kind Oh  okay okay. Oh oh okay  great. Now it's looks us useful. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-mm. Uh-oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  it's. Let's imagine. And what about the strawberries on the top? I'm not convince. But maybe I'm not trendy. But  uh Yeah  but uh uh they're not useful. I I mean it that's uh Mm-hmm. Yep. Hmm. I would have m uh i found more fancy that the fruits are useful. Yeah. Mm-hmm. But the n Yeah. Mm. No  I'm not sure uh why uh if it was like this I It's n no  it's not fancy any more. Okay. Uh-huh. And different routes. Okay  I see what Okay  so you you you feel like it's something uh a protection for the remote control. Also. Okay. Okay. Okay. Wow  that's a Yea Yeah  it's fudge titanium. You know. Right  yeah. And uh Okay. Let's go for one. Yeah. So it's a good evaluation. Yeah. Mm. Mm-mm. Okay. So now  it has to fulfil the financial criterium? So  I have an Here. Um. Okay  so two. Uh-huh. Oh. Yeah yeah  but the price is two. Oh  number. Sorry sorry sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. No  never. H Okay. And for the One also. I thought you can curve somebody. Mm-hmm. Oh see  I I think that the the price is this one. Yeah  yeah. Don't chip on me. Mm-hmm. Mm-mm. Yeah. But she wanted u the fudge titanium. I think it's five  but you don't say. Mm. Oh  sorry. Again  I'm See it. Special colour  or it's only on the Yeah  but there is no colour here. So I put it here. How many push-button? Three or two? Is there The scroll-wheel  okay. Okay. Um That's that's not We choose this one  and not this one. Or only a scroll-wheel. You try to s No  no  no. Because how do you do to y select? Yeah  I mean you you go on the location with your scroll wheel and then you Stay longer. Okay. Oops. Okay  okay. Um Mm-hmm. You you have all of these  no? Mm maybe n not this one but Yeah  so Not special colours an interest in? And buttons are not colourised? They are m Boo-hoo. It's already too expensive. Apparently. Yeah. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. So think of what we can cut uh here. Apparently  we have to choose one or the other. But you don't need a battery? Mm. But um it's like the hand dynamo  no? Uh it's a it's a beginning. Okay. So One here and here. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Mm. That's right. M maybe minus uh three  no? Mm-hmm. Mm. So Oh  sorry. Mm-hmm. Mm. Okay. Oh  we can put uh a hand dynamo and a battery if you want. Oh. Both its it's cool. Mm. Yeah  yeah y Yeah. Mm. It's maximum and don't have to Yeah  yeah. Uh Uh  mm-mm. Yeah. Mm. Okay. Mm. So target reached. It's um English uh Yeah. Yeah  but uh is uh English. So Mm. Mm  let's try. Okay. I save it uh Okay  so next mm No  that's yours. Sorry. 'Kay. Okay. So now We have to make um Yeah. Yeah. Mm. See mm how Are we a good team? Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Is there enough room for creativity? Mm. And you. Mm. Oh. Okay. Well  project evaluation. So  you say  is there sheep? Luck. Okay. So luck  but good. Which imply good uh team performance. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm. Okay. A lot of uh Yeah  uh new ways of doing financial Mm. Mm. They're working on um pink titanium. Mm yeah. Yeah  we're really nice. Yeah. Mm. Okay. I think it's Yeah. Uh How Yeah. Mm. I'm the one  proposing the celebration. Of course  you know I'm the program manager. Mm-hmm. Ah um  I think it's finish. Yeah. Mm. Mm-mm. And we go to the party. thank you to you. Mm. So  Hi Christa. Yes. Mm.. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Such a nice thing. Can I? Ho-ho. It says I will uh I'll buy it. If I if I need so. Hopefully my daughter will like it. Yes  of course. Of c course. Ah. Oh  there is a button missing. Okay. It's in option. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Hey  babe. Bob. Hey Bob. Okay  that's good. Oh  these are strawberries. Fruit smelling spongy titanium. I didn't know it exist  but that's great. Ha. You mean we can change the colour uh of th Yeah. Yeah okay  for the L_C_D_. Tit titanium is Uh  okay. Yeah  Bob  please. Tuesday colour. Okay. Mm-hmm. Black for Sunday. On the L_C_D_? Oh. Of course. What do you think? Strawberry sensors. Very useful. Lounge meeting. Alright. Good. So  huh. Interesting. In interesting. Mm mm. It makes sense. So uh  this is What a design. It's my turn. Mm-hmm. Let's see if this Yeah  if you meet the evaluation criterion. Yeah. So  evaluation please. So. You made a very nice prototype  and um  I think  we now need altogether to try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it  if it fulfils our what we want to do  and things like that. So mm Uh  next slide  please. As you know  before going and uh creating and producing these strawberry uh remote control  it's very important to first verify if it makes sense  if we have a chance to sell it. Uh  so we need to evaluate it um  try to do it in a constative way  and as much as we can. To so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven. One meaning that  ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion  whatever it is. And seven meaning  no it doesn't fulfil at all. And we're all l going to list all the criterion. I'm going to go to that next slide  and together try to evaluate this according to this criterion and from one to seven. And then we are just going to have an average  which will give us the value of our uh remote control. So  maybe we can have a look at the criteria? So these are the criterion uh I'm I thought were important. Of course  this can be discussed  but let's let's see  so let's vote. So we have fancy here and we have the scale from one to seven with four in the middle. So  what do you think  is it fancy? It is very very fancy. Or have you ever seen something like that? Yeah  of course. What do you think? Is it The weight is later. Now we're We're on the fanciness now. I think it's quite fancy. It's uh Yeah  so No it's it's one. Yeah  o one means it's  yes  a very fancy and seven mean no at all. So it's one or two. What do you think? Two? Okay. So here  two. Up. Then we have uh technology. So  what about technology? We have uh we have speech recognition  we have location based  we have L_C_D_. Change colour  I mean that's very Quite d I think it's a one for that  at least. At least a one  yeah. Robustness  uh-huh. So let's suppose my daughter take it and um and through it away. Do you think it makes sense that it's going to live again? Uh  maybe not the prototype. Let's try. Oh my god. Okay  we just lost one strawberry. So Not at all? It is Yeah. Yeah. So it's not so bad. I um uh I would say three. Yeah  that does make sense  yeah? Useful. Well  so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control? So I don't know. These buttons are uh It not clear. But you have at least uh next produce. Uh  it depends on the Okay. So but  for instance  because the L_C_D_ is not uh touch control  touch screen  you cannot go to channel twenty five directly. Directly. Yeah. Oh  it's a jog dial  okay. Uh-huh. Okay. Yeah. Okay. It's much longer than that that being two two five  no? Don't you think so? May not okay  we can go. That's uh You're right. That's it's less uh Yeah. But it's it's nice  because people anyway don't go there. But So what do you think for it  usefulness? Seems to be useful. Both. Yeah. Yeah. Up down or left right. Yeah. That Cool. I would say then uh Two or three? Two or three? Two. Okay  two. So size and weight. Is it the the the effective size and weight that the Is it uh real size  real weight? Or Because it Size is going to be that  yeah? Uh  and and It's going to be lighter  because this seems to be very heavy f I mean  for my daughter  for instance. Not sure if uh she can use it. So  should be okay. Up to three for that  because I'm haven't seen the weight so I must not uh Colour and shape. Well  so colour  it seems that we have the several colours for the L_C_D_. But um  it's not very clear what is the colour of the sh the sh the case. It's a it's going to be titanium. Okay  okay. That's nice. I think it's good. Okay. Yahoo. Well y you know  it's this uh fruit and vegetable year. So Uh  I think usefulness is m as as I rem um just have to remind you that usefulness is much less important than fanciness. Whether it's fancy or not now  it we have to decide. But this If it's Uh-huh. So  that they will that maybe the fruit may be here instead.. So  it seems we are not so clear on the shape uh I suggested three. Because uh  everybody s doesn't seem to be convince  although it's quite You have good arguments. But And uh the last one is adaptive. This is not r maybe not as important as the other one  but uh can we adapt it to each each personal use? Great. Fully adaptable. That's Yeah. So you can fit into your palm  okay. That What else can we need? You Do you think you are gonna be able to do that with ti titanium as well? It's fudge  yeah  yeah. Yeah  fruit titanium  yeah. Well  I if if this is if you are ready to do that  then I think it deserves a one. Okay. Now we have to do the average. Who is good in math? Okay. Two point one seven. That's nice. Two point one seven out of seven. I think we have a good good thing. Well  that's all I had to say about the evaluation. So It seems to be good  yeah. We have uh Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. Ah-ha. So so how many batteries do we need? One battery? Good. Why two? Say no. No  ne never install. Two batteries or one? Only one. No  no. But no  no. No  no way. Yeah. You never use uh Excel? Good. It's twelve bucks. Twelve bucks. Twelve and a half  I think. Okay. Okay  electronics. So It's a simple chip? Simple chip  okay. One. Okay. One or two? One? Okay. So the case  which one uh is it in the end? Let's do a single curve. It's flat  and curved. It's curvable. Maybe there is a supplement for that  no? It's only curve? Okay  let's go. This Okay  you d We tried  we tried. So  what is it? T titanium? Mm  that's expensive. Mm-hmm. Okay. Let's stick to s titan. Special colour? No because uh Yeah. Oh. So the L_C_D_ Two. Yeah. It's going to be expensive. That's all? No. Oh  I think  no it's Uh  is it a scroll wheel and pe push button  th this centre one? Or only only scroll wheel  okay. You are trying to make make up make us up. No  but you select with the two d the other two buttons  no? That's true. Yeah. Yeah. It should stay. Yeah. She's very hard on this. Special colour? Yeah. No. Special material? Yeah  buttons are the standard buttons. Yeah. It's only buttons  these. Nothing special. Okay. So we are at seventeen dot eight. No  the colour is in the L_C_D_. I no. We can just use this red. It's So what is Are we supposed to cut things out now? Uh  until we get twelve fifty. Well  if I look at what is the most expensive things  uh it's the L_C_D_ and the speaker. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. So that would So  but if we select the hand dynamo it's okay  we only We we win one. That's already that. Okay  let's do that. I'm not sure if this is legal. And? No. Okay  let's see. Yeah  yeah  yeah  if Click somewhere  you'll see features. Yes  it does. Maybe put minus two  so it looks uh more reasonable. Yeah  anyway No  minus two. Nobody will know. It's not recorded  is it? Okay  we're on time. Good. No  now we are exp exceeding I think. It Is it? I think we're exceeding now. We have to remove the Uh  it's better. I think they are counting uh We would prefer  yeah. Maximum is maximum. So  remove one of them. Yeah. Okay. Okay  we're uh on target. I'm just curious to see this uh my address chip on print. Trick. Uh  I would say it's the Russian trick  but Anyway No  they may have some their origins  strange origins No  no  no. Let's finish this meeting instead. What else? No. This is right. Okay  so finance  that's done. Are the cost under twelve? Yes. Project evaluation  good. Project process. Safe uh asse uh safe assessment. Yeah  I think we've listened to everybody. Everybody could say what they thought. And uh Yeah. When we see the results  there is no doubt there Maybe a lack of leadership? Team-work  very strong  I would say. Team-work  no problem. Means. Whiteboard  digital pens. Yeah  I think white-board is useful. Digital pens  useful. New ideas found? Yeah. But uh Yeah  but uh then I I mus That's true. And there's uh one very important point. We're on time. Meetings finish when they have to or even before. The for meeting it's uh one of the most important thing. Yeah. Yeah  we have other uh remote controls to create. Mm.. Mm  yeah. Hey  just wondering if my uh what about the the pink the pinkness of that uh. They are working on a Okay  good. I think we are great. There's no no other words for that. We are probably the best. Real Reaction is uh Yeah. Yeah. Finished? Ah  celebration. Are the costs within the budget? Of course they are. Yeah. Is the project evaluated? Yes  it is. To whom? To the whole our company? So  let's celebrate. Uh I think the meeting The meeting is over at least. So  we have to go out. Yeah  yeah  yeah. Yeah. Uh  here we have our prototype model. Yeah. Yeah  we have also some slides. In Yeah. Five. Him.. Experience. Explanat See this. You can Spongy. Hmm. So Yeah. This this is really flexible. You can add your buttons. Yeah. So function  mm So  as we discussed  we have to switch on switch off whenever we want. And so  we have buttons and using L_C_D_  or like you can use this jog wheel and select which ever option on the L_C_D_  and then do on and off. Then you ha you'll have volume control. So  you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume. And we have some L_C_D_ controls. Like  m switching the L_C_D_ display if you want to use L_C_D_  or you don't want you can just use normal button. And we have speech recognition. Here you have microphone  and then it date records your voice  and then it try to recognise. And it can also do the action. And location finder. And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser. You can just say  where is my remote control. Or uh  you can just give some nickname to your remote control  like Bobby. And then  it will say hi. Yeah  hi  and then you can use it. So  um our team is now fruits. Mainly strawberry. So  you can have And then you can see the look L_C_D_ and all the switches. Material  we want to stick to titanium. We will send  we want to Yeah  or s So  we want to have simple and perfect shapes  like I shown in these phones. You can have your own designs and and you can feel simple designs. And you can choose colours on your day for each day  or even many colours. For the L_C_D_. With titanium it's it is silver. Yeah. Mm  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Even you can configure your colours for its the depending on your mood  or s And you can have many colours on weekends. Or Huh? Ah  these are like sensors. So  after this meeting we'll propose a party for our success for So  if you are vegetarian or you have any options  please let us know. Yeah. S So  any specific questions for Yeah. Yeah. Then we can discuss We can Yeah  then we can have how much for how money is left. Yeah. Fudge. Yeah. Fancy. Huh. Yeah  what's is really Uh  it's really Yeah. Oh. Yeah  yeah. We can give at least five or six  seven. Oh  Oh. So Oh  okay. Yeah  okay. Oh  okay. So M maybe two. Technology. Yeah. Um And we have L_C_D_. So you change colours. Useful. Yeah  yeah. It's silly. Uh  still we need to cha Yeah  it Maybe strawberry. Oh. Yeah  we can easily plug it. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Useful? Yeah  Yeah. Yeah  channel. I this is volume control and channel changes. These are the main You Yeah. Yeah  and you can do on L_C_D_ using these going to scrolling all the option. So if you don't want Yeah  um yeah. Yeah. And channel. You can select. Yeah mm. Yeah  yeah  yeah. Y you need to like press two and five and Yeah. Yeah  yeah. Yeah mm. So  d Yeah  we need to address we want we only address two main functions here and the other functions will be on L_C_D_. So so Yeah. Yeah. Up. This is jog wheel. Yeah. Um  see in L_C_D_  like you will have blocks and you select which one. Yeah. Yeah. Two  maybe. Yeah  yeah. Yeah  it's size al almost Yeah  because it is The weight will be bit lighter. We will s We use titanium. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Heavy. Yeah. Yeah. But sides uh  the sides should be okay.. Yeah mm. Oh. Yeah. The case is silver titanium  no? Yeah. Oh. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. So maybe  I think Yeah. Yeah  well Yeah. Um Yeah  well then it's bit difficult to use. Not like this d We're just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attraction  too. So  maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges  stuff for strawberries and different colours. So it's Even These buttons But it looks really not really good. I mean  the f Yeah. So these are kind of rubber things. Even if you lose one you can just put whatever. Even we can provide many different colours or different fruits  and Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  we've yeah we have sensors here and so here and here  so we just Yeah  so even if you don't put  it works. But this is really fancy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You can Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Three  three  six  eight  eleven. Hmm.. Yeah mm. Yeah  two one one seven  we have. So Financi Energy. Uh  we use bat One battery. Yep. Oh  we just need one  I guess. No  number is one. We need only one battery. Number  number. So we We have sample chip. Uh  like simple chip  yeah. So  yeah. Yeah. Four buttons at least. And then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition. Yeah  one to one. Yeah  one. Yeah  I think we will go for a single curve  no? Oh  is Oh. Oh  okay. Yeah. Oh. Titanium. Yeah  well No  only one  no? Um Interface. Yes  in L_C_D_ display. Ok Yeah  an Yeah. Push-button. Scro Uh  two. Yeah. One scroll wheel. One L_C_D_ displayed. Yeah. Yeah  it's cheaper. Yeah. Only scroll wheel. Yeah mm. So It's already Ah. Y ye Yeah. Then it automatically we can just do like you feel  it goes. And it will activate Um  plus  yeah  it's price is really Special colours  yeah. Okay. Yeah  buttons and strawberries. Yeah. Special form. Uh  we have titan Yeah. Mm  hmm  I think uh because you can just go for a good colours. Yeah  and uh Yeah. Oh. Sample speaker. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe the jog wheel can be like kind of hand is Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  just remo S Yeah. Uh  no. Yeah. No  no. It's not It's not changing  no? It you don't So now on  we can increase our Still you have two more. Maybe we can use it for our party. Yeah. Yeah  yeah. Yeah  that No  but point five point three. Okay. Is really strict? Oh. Oh yeah. Ho Oh. Uh And we can discuss all these things in our party. Mm yeah  very much. Yeah  yeah. Yeah  it's really Yeah. Yeah  our team-work is really strong. Oh  we still  I guess. Hmm. Don't really. Yeah. And we also Mm. We made Mm. Hmm. Ah  we got new idea  speech recognition  location finding. New materials  new s uh this fancy strawberry design. And new tricks. Ah  very. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  yeah  it's We got two Good score. Oh  okay. So where we will go now? Uh  ye Will go to Italian restaurant  or Ah  okay. We can decide. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Yes. And chocolate? Mm-hmm. Yes  and place some slides. Uh  participant three. Prototype. Uh  so this is our remote control. It's a r working prototype. You can use it now by switching all these buttons. So first  I present as we came to this perfect model  and then we'll give some technical specifications. That's well  so that's that. Please  next slide. We analysed all the fruits and contacted NASA  and uh made some real good Yeah. If you can see this  and the stars are showing that. And um  s society will accept that. For sure. And making some analysis of different fruits  we choose the ultimate form  ultimate colours  and uh ultimate smell of it. S please  next slide. But we still didn't want to go far from our titanium idea  'cause it's the most of the moder the m the modern material we can p select. And it's practical. And it's still say it's for our needs  so please press something. And as I said  it's perfect. Please press it. Everyone is f really uh really glad to obtain an s such a r such a device. So you can touch it with your hands. Sure. Yes. N You must say it. Yeah. Okay. Y and we got the answer. Uh  it is  yes  of course.  please next slide. Um  this is a prototype. You can have a look at it  and That's all I wanted to say. Now it's technical specification by our colleague. We are still working on titanium. So  r we'll start with L_C_D_. You can ask Bob. It's Tuesday. That's location sensors. Yeah  and we can just some strawberry first. Um Oops. Let's make a party first maybe. Feel the weight. Really. Okay. Two. Two. Yeah  yeah  yeah. Yeah. Uh No. No. How can I say this. It's still it's still working  and your daughter got a bonus. A strawberry. You can. You go you So  the basic mode Yeah. So that's simple. The basic mode is uh you got just two buttons and a jog dial. With two buttons  you do this like uh volume up  volume down. Or if you go to the site  it's channel up channel down. And if you want to make to s twenty-five  you push on this. You select twenty  you select five. That's it. No. Yeah. Yeah. It's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the L_C_D_ screen. Like  selecting the menus. Sure  without titanium alloy  it's going to be light. Of course. Okay. Okay. And Moreover  moreover it covers it covers all the end goals. Even if it is  you know  it's very rounded  but still you got some rubber fruit here  and it's completely uh completely secure to leave it uh with children and that. Okay. Okay. Sure  sure  just look at it. It's full adaptable. Yeah  you can fit it into your palm  you know. Mm  It's two point one seven. No  uh you just Number. Yeah. How What what's the limit? Uh  it's it's okay that I don't know  'cause uh it's not my field. Twelve bucks. Okay  now Mm-hmm. Check that number also. It's it's flat. It's flat. But it is flat  you Look. It's curvable  but it's not curved. Oh  okay. Mm. Mm. Well  n Why three? Why three? For buttons. No  buttons just normal. That's for buttons. But buttons are standard. Well  as you may know there's some research done in the field of producing energy from mechanical eng  I mean  producing electricity from mechanical energy. So  the point is that when you take device and push the button  you produce enough energy to make electricity. Yeah  that you don't need a battery. So  it's something like hand dynamo robot. A real high-tech version of it. Okay  but l Why not. Let's do that. And I propose to So uh  about chips. Advanced chip on print  right? So  put minus one there  please. Why not? And? So  was there result? Let's have a look. Why? Oops. Yeah. Why not. Minus. Good. And a battery and a battery  yeah. Now it's fancy  let's add one instead of two. Well  I don't know. I don't know. I am not sure who was programming this calculator  you know. 'Cause uh I wonder if we put A_ or B_ somewhere instead of a number. Next slide. Okay. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. M maybe not  huh? What was the Oh yeah  what was good? Everything. What was bad? Yeah. A good leader  you know  a good leader is somewhere in the shade and Of course. Uh Not to waste time  that's important. We need time f New materials. Budget. Alright.. Okay. Yeah  it is. So  we see  we can even forecast. they propose us like celebration  everything  we could forecast it  right? You? It was you. Okay. Okay. ,The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented their prototypes to the group. Two prototypes featured different fruit shapes  with one including speech recognition instead of a large number of buttons. It also featured scroll wheels for channel control. The other prototype was designed like a banana with children users in mind. The Project Manager announced to the group that with all of their desired features  the project would go over the alotted budget; after a reanalysis of the features of the prototype  the project came in under the budget instead. It was decided that another feature could possibly be added. The group evaluated their effectiveness as a team and felt that all members worked well together and could be creative  and that the project had very good leadership. The Marketing Expert led an evaluation of the prototype according to the initial project goals; the evaluation showed that most of the goals had been sufficiently satisfied in order to launch the product. 
Okay. Everybody found his place again? Yeah? That's nice. Okay so this is our second meeting. And uh still failing? Uh now we're going um into the functional design. Um important thing of this phase is that we're going to uh try to get an agreement about the user requirements  technical function design  and the working design. So that we can move onto the second uh phase. But first this phase. Um first an announcement. There's a little adaptation in the air conditioning system. So There's our ghost mouse again. That that means that you can have a little trouble with  little trouble with the air conditioning  that's because of this uh It's in wing C_ and E_. So it should be over in a in a while  couple of days. But it's going to be cold anyway  so I don't think you're gonna need it. Then our agenda. Now first the opening. Uh this time I will take the minutes. Uh you're going to have a presentation. All of you. Um and we've got forty minutes for the whole uh prese for the whole uh presentations. So uh I suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation  and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements uh which have been sent to me. And then the decision on the control functions uh which we wanna include and those which we don't wanna include. So we've got forty minutes for all of it. So I suggest um let's start with the first presentation. Um who wants to be first? Okay. So Just maybe it's easier if you um Yeah I think you will tell your presentation as well. Just which function you have and what you're gonna talk about. Okay. Thank you. So anybody have um any questions until now? About functional requirements? Okay that's clear. Now to the second. Yeah. Yeah you can take your time. We've got uh plenty of time  so Yeah. There it is. Yeah. One remote. Hmm. 'Kay. Yeah. Okay. Anybody has questions about the technical functions? Yeah. Touchscreen. Huh. 'Kay. That's nice. Uh Yeah. That's right. Uh maybe we can first um listen to your presentation? Uh And then we have a little discussion about the requirements and uh design. I think it's going to Uh it's not too much. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Uh Okay now I hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing right now. Um I'm the Project Manager so I'm here to mess things up and uh tell you some new uh requirements. Um that's  we've uh got to design a um remote which is only suitable for T_V_. Um that's because uh it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big  if we wanna have it uh for more functions. So it has to be simple. Uh another point is we have to skip the teletext  because in the world of uh upcoming internet uh we think teletext is going to be uh a thing of the past. And uh it's a function we don't need in our remote control. Um internet is also mentioned in a function we can use. Uh maybe also on televisions it will be available as well. Another one is uh the customer is uh forty plus. Uh that's the the market we have to to to target  because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers. Um this is uh a bit pity for the Marketing uh Expert. Because he was uh aiming on the the younger persons. So we have to find a market which is above forty plus uh but which will suit our uh remote control  and the other way round. And we have to be very uh attent in uh putting the corporate image uh in our product. So it has to be visible in our design  in the way our device works. And uh we have to be uh very clear on this point as well. So I suggest let's have a discussion on the control functions. Yeah. Uh we can see if we can find a way uh between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product. Um Against the no teletext? Um Yeah it's it is Standard remote. No I think we can I think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons which were also mentioned. Uh if we put a lot of effort in those  we can make a remote control with uh just two or three buttons. Or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach because it is forty percent of the market. And um if you look in Holland at the whole generation of forty plus  fifty plus  it it's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now. No. But don't you think that if we make a remote which is uh typically made for this market  that people think the people think that's the the device I've looked for although I didn't realise it. So let's try it. Yeah. Yeah. It's a big success. Very big success. Yeah. Uh. I think so as well. Uh I simply think um uh that the new products we are gonna make  uh spef specifically design  are designed for uh younger people  uh so maybe we can focus ourself on the elderly people. And I think we have to um see what requirements we need for those um remote controls. 'Cause what you told is the channel selection is important. Volume selection  power and teletext. Okay. Um No we we haven't voted yet  so Uh I think teletext can be uh um can be a function as well. But only if uh if it won't higher the the cost  because I don't know if it will be a lot more money to implement teletext as well  but I don't think it will be a problem. Or is teletext a Yeah. Yeah. So I suggest uh Yeah. Is anybody um really against teletext? No? Just that  that we just keep the teletext. I think that's a good idea as well  especially for the subtitles. Maybe we can make that um another point of advantage in our remote control  if we uh make a k a button ex for example for big subtitles  which is instantly on the remote control. For elderly people they can think  oh I wanna have subtitles  and they push the button and they get the big subtitles. Um so I think teletext can v can be very useful in our advantage. Um Functionality should be few buttons  you said. I think uh that's very important we have a few buttons. So to keep it simple. No. Yeah. But do you need But do you need the buttons for one to zero. Maybe c we can Maybe we can use uh No  maybe we can implement the scroll button? Or a joystick like? There are other ways too. Just look if you look at telephones. The Sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or That's right. the numbers yeah. Yeah they can see how much buttons there are going to be on on the display  and if it's too much we can uh reconsider it. But I think there won't be very much buttons. Or there don't have to be a lot. The number of buttons? I think it's very important in the in the design. You can make a very fancy design uh with putting the buttons on the right places. And if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with To operate only the T_V_ yeah. No. So. 'Kay. So we can Yeah. That's right. Yeah. So you suggest we could better um focus on for example the docking station. Uh uh like other functions. Instead of f of less buttons. Mm. No. Do you think the docking station will uh is allowed in the budget we have? 'Cause it can be No. Yeah. Because I think that's uh That's a good advantage point as well. If we have a fancy-looking docking station or very That's a nice requirement. Docking station. I think so. Yeah. That's a good point. Um You said they easily get lost as well. Yeah. So maybe we should implement the audio sign  or something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So audio signal should be possible as well. I think it's not too expensive. Uh another point is the L_C_D_ screen. Um I don't know if that will rise the cost too much  because Yeah. It will be too much as well. Yeah. Based. Just the L_C_D_. Oh just the normal screen. That's a good idea. So Some extra info. Feedback. Yeah. I think that's a good idea as well. As the small screen. Extra button info. I think that should be possible as well. Um let's see what did we say. Mm. More. Should be fancy to  fancy design  easy to learn. Few buttons  we talked about that. Docking station  L_C_D_. Um general functions Yeah. 'Kay. And default materials. I think that's a good idea as well  because um elderly people don't mind if it's a titanium cover or just a plastic one. So that doesn't really matter. So I think we nee Uh let's um specify the target group. Because are we talking about elderly elderly people or people from forty to eighty. Because I think what we're going to design now is for people above sixty  maybe. Uh what do we want? If we want um a with uh for example the the telephone for elderly people  we can target the real elderly people. Yeah. So that's the Now you're talking about sixty to eighty for example. Yeah. Sixty. Okay. And different cultures. Are we Okay. No. We've got five minutes left just now. Small warning. Should Yeah. In different languages  you know. Yeah. or you have to put a language button in it  but that will be a bit unnecessary I think. It's better to put it on different markets with it all. Okay. So that's the the target. Uh then a few small things. Uh okay. I will put the minutes in the project uh project document folder. Um what we're going to do for the next meeting is the Industrial Designer will do the components concept  User Interface Designer the user interface concept  and the trend-watching. So just keep in mind the things we've said about the target group  uh requirements  and the trends which are uh going on. And uh specific instructions will be sent to you by uh the personal coach. So um I thank you for this meeting. And I think we have a lunch-break now. So that's a good thing. No. Well I think if we are gonna use a touchscreen uh we're gonna go way above the twelve and a half Euros. But the It wouldn't be very robust. It's very fragile and you can get scratches on it. That's. Okay. Okay I've got a presentation about the working design. Um first about how it works. It's really simple of course. Everybody knows how a remote works. The user presses a button. The remote determines what button it is  uses the infrared to send a signal to the T_V_. The T_V_ switches to the frequency  or what function it is. So we've got um the the plate. It gots conductive disks for every button. When the user presses a button  a signal got sent  goes to the LED and transmits tranmi transmits its to the T_V_. It's a very simple device  technically speaking. So this is a schematic overview. You've got the buttons. The power source. And uh when a button gets pressed  its goes to the chip. The chip uh controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb. When you press a button you can actually see your pressed button. Well um I think we should use default materials  simple plastics. Keep the inner workings simple  so it's robust. Uh I think we should focus on aesthetics  the design and the user interface  because if you're going to use high-tech materials the price is going to go sky-high. And uh you only have to design a remote once  and if you use high-tech materials it come back in every product. So it's  in my idea  it's uh it's gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in uh in the product itself. That's it. I think that if we're If we put our marketing right um we can sell this just like um I don't know if you've heard about it in the news  the the elderly mobile phone? Yeah if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind  we could make tons of money  I think. We don't have to focus on on on the on the design then but on functionality. We just change our focus on the project  and I think we can uh we can sell this. No. Uh that's a good idea. Yeah. And besides that it's um If we're gonna focus on elderly people they'll have to adapt. They're not used to using scroll buttons. So perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout. It should be possible yes. If it's not too fancy. And if the remote stays rather small  it should be possible yeah. Yes. So we're just gonna focus on the extras? Yeah. Like with your key-chain  if you whistle it goes uh it makes a sound. Yeah. Y i um I think we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen  'cause it's uh Well I don't think they have different television sets uh in uh every country. 'Cause Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Okay. No. Yes. Think I'll go first. 'Kay. My name is Freek Van Ponnen. I'm the Market Expert. But you already knew that. Um I've done some research. We have we uh have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed um users operating remote controls. Uh we let them fill out a questionnaire. We had one hundred of these uh test subjects. Uh in addition we did some market research. Uh see what the market consists of. What ages are involved. Well these are three quite astonishing results  I thought. Um remotes are being considered ugly. F uh seventy five percent of the um people questioned uh indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly. Um and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control. So Um in addition remotes were not very functional. Fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control. And fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room. So some things. Then we did some research to the most relevant functions. Channel selection and volume selection um both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy. The power button got a nine. And teletext got a six and a half. So these are the most most uh important functions on a remote control. Then there are some one-time use function. That's what I like to call them. That uh audio settings  video settings  and channel settings buttons. Which are not really used very frequently  but are still considered to be of some importance. Um channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently. One hundred and sixty eight times per hour. Then these are the This is the market. Um sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six. Um Main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical on the remote control. Um they like to use new f new functions. But they also are very critical. They won't spend their money very easily. So Um the users of forty six to sixty five years cons The make up forty percent of the market. They are not really very interested in features. But they do tend to spend their money a lot easier. Um What I think this indicates for our um design. I think we should make a remote for the future. And this means we would um have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five. Uh this also makes up most the biggest part of the market  so that will also be where our main profit would be gettable. Um this would mean we would have to make a fancy design. Um The results also indicated that um about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused R_S_ R_S_I_. Um this is certainly something to take into account. And thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control  remote control. So these are two factors that I think should be included in the design. Besides of course that the remote must look very nice. And the functionality As a lot of people indicated  they only use about ten percent of the buttons  I think we should make very few buttons. Uh this will also be uh beneficial to the design of the remote. Uh I think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised. Especially the channel selection and audio uh selection buttons. 'Cause they're used most and so they should be robust. They shouldn't break down easily. Um Then as mo as a lot of people indicated that their um remote got lost in the room  it might be and I say might be because it would um certainly boost the uh production costs a lot. But it might be a good idea to make a docking station. And this would  could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep. So you'd know where it is in the room. And in addition to this it could um recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in. Then um a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that um an L_C_D_ screen in the remote control would be preferred. This was um mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five. But up till forty five it remains feasible. This would also greatly increase the production costs but I think these are just some small factors we could consider. That would be all. Any questions? 'Kay. Yeah you should go to the top thingy. Slide show. Oh yeah. Hmm. Well it would certainly make a fancy design. So That is true. We would have to look into that. Yeah. So is there any discussion possible about the new product requirement? Yeah 'cause you're you're saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature and it's not gonna be used anymore anyway pretty soon. And new T_V_s will have internet access on them. But I think if you're targeting people of forty plus  the chance that they will have a T_V_ with internet access within the next like twenty years is very slim. In addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control. So I think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it. I'm pretty much against it. Yes. Besides that  I think the market for forty plus is like pretty small. But I mean if I s if I see this  it's I think we're just gonna go for another pretty and not innovative remote control. Yes but it's not the biggest part of the market. And besides that  they're not very critical so I mean they don't really care what the remote control is like. They'll just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable. No. I think that would be the case in the sixteen to forty five age category. because they are critical and they they want to have a fancy remote control. People of forty plus  I mean they want it to work  but as soo as soon as it works it's okay with them. So I haven't heard of it. Hmm. Yes. Yes. But obviously the board tends to disagree. Yeah  also. I think it'd definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext. Yes. Mm-hmm. But I don't think that's really an issue any more 'cause Well might be. But I mean it  if it's only for T_V_ you're not gonna need a lot of buttons anyway. You need a one to zero button  next channel  previous channel  volume up  volume down  and some teletext buttons but I think if you if you only l Nah. Think if you're gonna include teletext you do. I think many people like to use that. 'Cause if you should  if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five  you don't wanna push the next channel button thirty five times. That's true but um I don't think there are many T_V_s that can switch channels that fast. And so you would need like the T_V_ would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it. And I dunno if many channels would do have that. If many T_V_s have that. Mm-hmm. But I don't think I think if you're gonna make a remote control only to operate a T_V_  you there's not much you can gain on um having as few buttons as possible. 'Cause I think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a T_V_  which already only have the minimum number of buttons. I don't think there's much to be gained in that area. Yeah. That is true but I think there's simply not much to gain on the competition when you when you're making a remote control only for to operate only the T_V_. 'Cause if you have a a remote control only to operate a T_V_ there's simply not a lot of buttons required. There's not a lot of functions required so most existing remote controls simply don't have a lot of buttons either. So I think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here. That would that would cost a a big marketing expedition which was one of the arguments to make it only for the T_V_ because we didn't have the time to market a lot. Maybe. Well yeah I think  mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons and But I don't think we should spend very much time in that. Yeah I think maybe we should do some research into what elderly people like to have in a like to have extra in a new remote control. Yes well fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost. Yeah that was what I suggested. You have it on Yeah you have it's on some phones too  which have a docking station. And you just press a button and the phone goes ringing. So you know where it is. I think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn  and we're focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices  it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it  which would explain a button if you press it. Which would tell you what it does. And it wouldn't have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen  but Just a small screen with two Yeah. But I dunno if that would that would fit into the costs. No. I think probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls than youngsters. Yeah. I think I think that would be a If we should do something like that it would be a  I think it would be really good for uh for the image of the company. And I think  I think there would be a good market for it. If we're able to really bring an innovative product. Yeah the really But I'd have to look into that a little more. 'Kay. And with uh the little screen in it  which explains the buttons. You could I think we n it would be a lot easier to adapt it to different cultures. Yeah. Yeah. 'Kay. That's good. Okay. Mm. Mm-hmm. Uh okay. Um I've been looking at uh the user interface of it. Um f for the techno f functions uh of of it. Um Okay. Mm? Oh. Uh. Okay. Um yeah. I think uh we uh must use the general functions uh of the uh remote control. Uh uh I've do I've uh done a little uh research on the internet and not much information about it  Um about uh interface but uh Uh Yeah I I've been thinking about a simple manner uh to put a lot of functions uh uh in one um in one uh remote control. Uh so uh you've got a lot of devi uh devices like uh D_V_D_ uh uh television  uh stereo. So um But uh it must be uh user-friendly. So um uh you c you can't put a a lot of uh functions uh in one uh Yeah. Uh uh uh Yeah. In one um remote control. But um Yeah. Um yeah. Got uh many functions in one uh remote control  um but um yeah you can see  this is uh quite simple uh remote control. Um few uh buttons but uh This uh re uh remote control got a a lot of uh buttons. Um uh people uh don't like it  uh so um Well what uh I was uh thinking about was um uh keep the general functions uh like they are. So uh like uh the on-off uh button. Uh keep it uh yeah l like a red button. Uh everybody everybody knows it so uh uh you don't have to change that. Um My personal uh preferences um. Use a display for uh specific uh functions of the different uh device. So um Wh what I was th uh thinking about was um you've got um Uh this the remote control uh and uh you got here the general functions  uh like uh the on-off button uh sound uh I dunno um And um here you've got a s kind of a display. It's a touchscreen. So um yeah you got a general f uh f the functions of the device uh for a D_V_D_ player or uh so um the pl yeah um f for uh playing uh reverse uh. And um you got here uh real buttons for uh selecting uh a device. So um this button is for a D_V_D_ or So um for every um device you've got a uh a f a b a part uh display of a part buttons. So uh you you never got uh all the buttons uh on w one device. So uh that's uh my uh idea about it. Um yeah and Uh let's see. Uh yeah. So a touchscreen. Uh and um th the buttons uh the real buttons uh we have to use um. We better c um uh use uh quite uh large buttons uh for um yeah. Everybody uh have to use it so Uh ol even even old people um young people. So uh we must keep uh buttons uh quite s uh simple and quite large. So uh Um Yeah. Uh yeah. That was uh my uh part of it. So N I I don't think so. Uh you got uh quite a cheap uh touchscreen. S um it's uh not uh in colour or something. Uh it's just uh um one colo Uh yeah. Uh I seen uh w uh something on the internet uh not today but uh a few uh weeks ago. Uh you got uh yeah quite an uh a kind of uh touchscreen um and it's uh for uh twenty uh Euros or uh less uh. So it's possible. Yeah. Yeah that's true. Uh. Okay. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Mm. forty Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah. But um deaf people need uh teletext for uh for subtitles. So it's Yeah. It's Mm. Yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If it's only for televi Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So we can s we can skip the display  so uh we don't need it. Uh Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Hmm. No. No. No. Hmm. Mm. Hm. No. Mm. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. No. So 'Kay. Yeah. Right. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. ,The Project Manager reviewed the minutes from the last meeting. The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented the prototype and displayed the changeable fruit- and vegetable-shaped covers. They discussed the locator function that will be designed at a later time. The Project Manager discussed the final production cost for the device  which totaled 11.9 Euros. The Marketing Expert led an evaluation of the prototype. Each participant rated the prototype according to the original criteria for the project. The group discussed the areas in which the prototype did not meet these goals. The group felt that the changeable fruit and vegetable shapes were uncomfortable to hold. The group decided to make changeable covers in fruit colors and designs and to use one uniform shape. The group discussed their experience on the project. They felt they worked well together and were creative. They complained that the meeting-room materials were difficult to use  and some complained that there was not enough information provided to them. The Project Manager instructed all participants to write a final report at the end of the meeting. 
I'm listening. Right. Great. Alright  great. Yeah  great. Alright  Trendwatch. Right. I will speak about uh latest trends trends  latest fashion updates  and uh things we must not do. Uh the trends. It's very important that uh the control is fancy looking and good uh feeling. Uh this because of our last model was very functional  but it uh people didn't like that  so our new mo model must be very good-looking. That's uh something you uh have to take a look at. And uh the feeling has to be very great. Also the menus and things like that they have to they have to feel great. Um there's a minus uh two times here  because this is the most important point. This is uh two times as less important  and uh same for this one. Um  technological technological innovations  that's uh regarded very highly too. Uh such as an uh L_C_D_ screen  uh speech uh acknowledgement  as we uh talked about earlier. So we have to have uh something like that  like we uh Right. Uh the last point is easy to use. Well I think that uh speaks for s for itself. I don't know who's uh who's going to look at that. Yeah? Yeah  I know. I think we have to go for the first one. It's the most important one. So we have to uh take that one. So it it it isn't very important that that it works easy. But it has to look great. We'll see. Yeah  right. But the most important thing is that it looks great and people say wow  that's real great uh great concept. Alright. Uh these are the new colours of this year. So it must be very bright  very colourful. People like this. So we we have to think uh in this direction. So i set your mind to it. Findings? Fashion update? Fruit and vegetables are cool. I am told. The group we are targeting is uh very pleased with fruit and vegetables. So we we we might cons consider in front of uh in in that sort of uh way. Uh furthermore uh material  that's your part  should be very strong. I was thinking of something like uh well uh iron plate over it  maybe in a colour or something  that looks so f really flashy but it it is also strong. And that's uh also for the younger public. Yeah  that's great. But I think we can all make the the fronts of titanium or something uh really thin. So it looks very heavy but you can still uh use it very easily. Well  the don'ts. Older people like dark colours and simple shapes. Well we don't want uh older people  we want young people. So uh we're gonna turn that around. We're gonna have real uh cool shapes and lots of colours. Right? Okay. We don't want wood. Old people. So  that's it for me. Yeah  we should change that. No no no. Mm. Yeah. We keep coming back to the fronts. Yeah. Fruity. Fruity. Well it's got a strong look  this. Yeah. Yeah  it still has a strong look. But then you are losing your fruity colours. That's true. Yeah but the But it doesn't have to look strong. The the results are  the feel of the material is expected to be strongy. The feel. Nah yeah the feel Right. I agree. I dunno. Yeah right. Yeah. Right. Oh okay. Right. No. But that that makes it cheap. It's it's just a an extra function  and it's cheap. No but Yeah  right. Young people love them. Yeah  ple Right. Alright. How How How do you uh uh give input to the menu on the L_C_D_ screen? Alright. So you have a menu button  and then you can go up and down. Yeah right. Yeah.. You have to push hard. Yeah. Yeah. You've Right. And you you need a you need a speaker. For the Yeah. Yeah. Exit. But we need a we need a a recording recording button for the speech uh part. Or don't Right  and spea speaker at the back  or something. Alright. Alright. Yeah  fine. Move on. Yeah. Nei They're n they're not trendy. It doesn't look strong. Yeah right. This is just crazy. Nah th It's too expensive. Yeah. But are we going for a strange uh form? 'Cause people like that. Not too strange. You can make the the underside  you can make it more round  where the L_C_D_ is. I dunno if you know the No Nokia telephone  with uh the round uh thing at at the bottoms  s something like that. You know? Yeah  but people like something uh new you know. Yeah  different. Y yis Alright. Great. Your bag. Yeah. Materials are the most  most impor Yeah. Do you know the new uh No no The front is the most important. But the feel of plastic isn't strong. Yeah alright  alright. 'Kay. Yeah. Fronts are are cheaper than when they're from plas Yeah  but it it's expensive. Bendable. Bendable. Yeah. Paint spray. Yeah alright. So  we're going for a titanium back and a plastic front? Yeah  great. Yeah. But then you have the problem  when you have a titanium back  you can't switch it. When you want an other colour on the front  it doesn't match. You know? I understand. Yeah  yeah  yeah. Yeah. Alright. Yeah. Alright. Funky customers. Alright. Nei. So external. Yeah. Alright. I think we can launch a couple of packages. You can buy a different kind of of of machine  but it's the same thing  but with another front. So And you can you can Yeah right. Yeah but if you if you launch uh five different packages like iPod mini Yeah. It's good marketing. Yeah  n not too heavy. You can always take another pick. They have to buy it later on. Yeah right. More basic. Yeah. Yeah  right. Yeah. Yeah. But we we must remember that fancy look-and-feel is the most important thing. Else it w won't sell. So Lost my mouse. Unbelievable. Yeah. Yeah togeth You can take the SMARTboard. Have fun. 'Kay. We don't have produ product yet  so kind of difficult. Ajax. Nah. Um round. Yeah. Round. Curvy. Yeah. So you can see you have to up or down. And this must be uh volume I think  and this programme. Yeah. Yeah  that's right. Yeah. Okay. Yeah  I noticed. You can't uh click the corners. It's a real real great thing. Let's start the design. O Yeah. Me too. But we kree we keep adjusting to the fashion with our fronts. So Yeah  right. The logo Yeah. But the logo the logo shouldn't be exchangeable  when you get off the front. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  but you can scratch it off or something. It's better if you have it uh Yeah. I agree. But not too big. Just uh Yeah. Okay. Yeah. No no no no. You have to make this titanium too. Else you you get problems with the L_C_D_. Like dust in it and so things like that. When you exchange all the fronts and it's open. Yeah. Some some kind of wei weight in it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  you can make it go round this corner too where the logo is. Because it has to be uh there all the time you know. So uh a little corner of titanium. So this this is the exchangeable part. Right. Taking all the credit. But there's a problem. We can't uh take a blank one. Or can we? Yeah. Nah that's alright  that's alright. This one is empty. You have to empty one huh? Alright. No Yeah. Yeah. It's not relaxing. I I don't have a laptop. Yeah right. Dream on. Half No. It's all about cool things. And it will sell. We will be rich. No. No man. You just have to push harder. Yeah. Mm. Recalibrate it. Yeah. Finish meeting now. Yeah. Oh. Alright. Have fun lads. Mm-hmm. Alright. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Alright. Alright. Easy to use? I think that's your ta Mm. You Yeah. Yeah  yeah  you can make a very complicated uh uh remote anyway  so ease of use It's not a very comp complicated device. Alright. Uh you think? Mm. Mm. Alright. Yeah  among the old people  yeah. Right  I am going to tell you something about the components design. Uh again I have uh put up the specification properties. This uh so um uh the different uh components of the of of the device. And the materials? Um I have heard several things  so I uh I'll have to change that on the way. But uh the case? Uh I suggested uh in the previous meeting hard plastic. But uh as you indicated uh it should be strong. It should feel strong. So maybe plastic is not uh sufficient. We should move to uh something Well yeah. Y Hard plastic i is of course uh pretty pretty tough  but it doesn't have a really really tough look. So Yeah. Also Yeah. Mm-hmm. But we'll return to that. Uh the buttons of course rubber  I think everyone agrees. And electrical cables  copper is all pretty basic stuff. The chips made of silicon  I guess. I think that's the best uh way to do it. And infra infrared l LED is uh just a simple bulb. Then I've uh had a few findings  made a few findings. Uh the target audience product style. Um it's uh um generally the case that uh senior and wealthy people above uh forty five years old uh like  as you said  uh particularly the traditional materials as such as wood and materials such as that. They also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style. But of course that's not our uh things this. So this is things we must not do. And then we have uh young uh and dynamic uh people  which is of course our uh group  the people we aim at. Um under forty five years old. Uh they like soft materials uh with primary colours. Soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said  that uh it should be hard an and and and and strong looking. But they like soft materials  uh so we might uh we have to consider that. And also they like curved round shapes. So not uh too formal like like uh the older people want. And if uh also a finding but not very ap applicable here  that sports and gaming devices such as uh discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices  gaming devices  should define the characteristics of the device. But uh since we don't have a really a sports or gaming device  so we don't really have to consider that. Mm. Well I also have um several examples of uh styles  so you can get a clear picture of uh what I mean. Uh these are the basic uh older older peoples' stuff. It was not very uh interesting uh  very classical looking  but that's n that's not what we want. We have these kind of things. I don't know what exactly they are. It looks like Well you know uh you recognise the shapes  it's very primary colours  uh bright colours and uh round shapes. You also uh see uh this device  it's not very round and Fruity of course. Yeah  it uh That's true. And uh well round shapes  primary colours. You can see it all here. And of course uh this famous device. I think as you know something uh some devices like this. So to give you an idea of uh This has a strong look. Although it's plastic  it's it's grey to to to give it iron look. That's uh Yeah. Well we have to make a Well we can't really make a round uh a round remote control. I don't think that's very practical  but But uh it's important to to uh to think about the colour. Because if we make it grey or or silvery looking  it it does make it a lot more uh does make it looking a lot more stronger. 'Cause if you look at this  it it doesn't look very very strong  becau But this is plastic  and and this too  but The feel? Uh alright. Well Mm-hmm. And I Then I have some more findings. Um uh about the energy energy source of the of the device  uh I uh suggest uh the basic battery. I uh got some other um uh uh energy sources of course. But solar energy is not very practical inside a house  because you don't have a have a lot of uh sun. And uh kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical  I think  for uh for a simple remote  that's a bit  oh  that's a bit uh That's a bit uh much. And I also suggest uh as a shape uh a double curved case. Uh the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium. That that's the information I received. If you use the curved case  uh a curved case  double curved then you can't use titanium. Now uh this uh to give it a more modern look. And uh now the the shape  yeah  a curved case. Um yeah I think uh sort of triangle-shaped bottom or something. Uh a more modern look not plain  long box style  but I'll draw it  but maybe later. And it makes uh it gives it a more u user friendly shape  than if you have uh. Um anyway Um f as uh for the buttons  simple push buttons. No uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that  because it makes more complex and expensive. And  uh as we agreed  we don't use a speaker or a sensor or um uh speak uh speech uh controlled device. Because it makes it also more complex and expensive. But we do use an L_C_D_ screen  so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip  which is more complex and expensive. But It's worth the trouble I think  because Uh rubber is a soft material  I guess. Uh soft enough. So that's uh basically what I want to talk about. Oh  yeah  I understand. Yeah. Yeah. But it it's n nice for young people. They like gadgets. Yeah. If it's cheap. Yeah. Can you draw it now of uh Can you draw it now? Mm. Alright. button  yeah. I suggest a banana shape. Because of the fruity uh fashion. Yellow and Yeah alright  yeah. Just a hunch. Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course? And then below is the L_C_D_ screen? Alright  yeah. Mm-hmm. Uh by pe pressing the menu button again. By pressing the menu button again  you go uh out. It's usual the the the d kind of the way it works. Yeah? Yeah? Yeah. But you can men you can press menu again to get out. No. Why would you put it uh then  and where is the recording uh the microphone? Where would you put it? Uh-huh. Microphone  yeah. Yeah I understand. Uh but uh we could uh d do  but it's perhaps more expensive  uh the speaker on the back or something. Alright. Well yeah yeah yeah. I can live with it. They do they don't look fruity enough. Tho Yeah those But it doesn't uh the Yeah  ok Yeah. But it it must not look too childish of course huh? But it Yeah. Not not too strange. No. Exotic yeah. We have t Yeah  yeah. I will design it  we design it later. So we'll get to that later I guess. The specific shape. The Our sources. But uh we should decide now. So we have to uh put it in one uh document. Copy paste uh this story into a into a Word document  and then uh put the answers after the subjects. Yeah. Well we have to decide all these things? W we can uh override them? Well a case? Uh that's me. Uh I suggest Well what do I suggest actually? Uh s solid  yeah. Yeah. Yeah  I understand. Yeah. So we have titanium. Yeah but the non-removable elements of the of the remote  so not the front  could be titanium  to give that uh strong look. And then the front is made of plastic. And you can put that on and off  and switch it. No but you have titanium of course. Uh you have the best of both worlds. And of course  yeah  you have the the the plastic front end. But you also have the titanium. Yeah of course  but yeah you have to make a decision. I guess so. Uh titanium I sh I think uh Huh? Well  well the According to my sources  uh it's it's totally possible to make an entire uh uh uh Titanium is available  and uh we can uh make uh an entire remote out of it  if we want. Mm. Mm. Yeah  I think that's a nice trade-off. Alright. Yeah  for the front and then titanium for the back. For the non-removable uh part. Well but The titan titanium isn't isn't v very Yeah  i it doesn't uh curves. No uh I nei. Titanium is very No no no  but you know b Titanium is very basic colour  and it doesn't really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front. I dunno if if you disagree  but I think it's doesn't matter very much. And even if it does uh doesn't match  it will uh People like mm colours that don't match. Cop copper uh material. Excuse me? Yeah copper i just a ba basic uh Yeah in Yeah well inside the remote control we use a couple of uh Oh external? Well A coffee grind doesn't have Na ja. Never mind the coffee grind. Right? Alright. Mm-hmm. Yeah the the the front w Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. For the for the launch  yeah. So e th then a c couple of basic colours. Not not very uh sim Not Yeah. Yeah. Very boring  yeah. The most boring fronts possible. Yeah but you you can have some basic colours  and then we come with the special patterns on them  and and uh And uh Uh we still have to make We have still have to make the es the the real basic design. Because yeah we have the sketch but Alright  yeah. The price? We all agree on that. Yeah. Together or uh Yeah together. How Yeah yeah  but how do I Some Some non functional tasks. You're fired. No but Well  can we talk about something else? Uh Uh no I don't know anything  but maybe uh anyone else uh Yeah? Round I think. To make it as uh as round as possible. But now I see the Well th th th th th that depends uh. Well we uh We we j we'll just give them an uh We'll design it  and then they can give comments on it. Well yeah. Um I think um a logo  our company logo  and the slogan should be or could be Yeah  why not? If there's enough space  you can put uh We'll we'll Well  our slogan is not very long. It's just a simple What is it? You c But you can put it on the back  on the titanium part. The logo and the and the Yeah they do. Well yeah. Right corner  or maybe here in the middle? Yeah it it should be hard on the on the on the board  and you can remove the front. I l I like the idea of the of the slogan on the on the on the thing. But am I the only one  or uh No not on the front  but on the backside. Uh I think it's a nice idea  to make it more recognisable  that the next to the logo you have the slogan. To make more uh of an impression. Not too big. No  very small. Not on the entire back  but uh just very small. But readable enough of course. But we'll uh we'll take that uh with us into the design. Lo Uh yeah. Or maybe here in the middle  but we'll decide later. Do you do you see a bit of the of the um of the uh titanium? O on the front? Uh maybe if we make this this this lower part titanium  the front is the the upper part  and the the bit with the with the L_C_D_ screen. So Yeah. No no betwe of between we can do but But then you have two parts of front  two fronts that This enti entire bottom? And then the lower part is titanium? I think that's nice  yeah. Yeah. I like that bit of uh titanium also on the uh A bit like uh a bit like your mobile phone. Maybe you can show it. It also has the those two distinct uh Mm bit like this. Uh it's uh Yeah yeah. That uh Yeah. Maybe a nice touch  yeah. I think I'm going to buy it. That's a bit too much  but No  no no no  but I think uh this looks uh pretty nice actually. Of course  because it's my design but No our d our design  alright. But don't erase my cat. I want to preserve it. What are you doing chief? Yeah until the until the beep goes. But I don't uh Do we have to stay here  or I think we have to return first. The high powers from above will have to tell us  yeah. Yeah  touch-pads  yeah. We can uh do a touch-pad on our remote. No just kidding. Well we have uh b you have to have a bit of humour in the in the discussions too  because it becomes too too too too stressy. But uh th youth doesn't care about functio functionality  so Yeah. Bless you. Mm. Too much? Well they uh I think that's good. We all had uh our talk and we agree I guess on uh several thing  on most uh on things. Yeah you have to push harder. Mm. Where's the good old chalk board with the the green board with the  how do you call it  chalk  yeah. Yeah  maybe. Maybe if i if that thing is recalibrated  we can draw a thing quick  and then before it uh goes off again. Maybe w maybe we maybe w m Can we get email here? Huh? Yeah. Guess so. A happy hol happy holidays. Well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use. Bananas. Yeah. Yeah. Soccer fronts. Mm. Hmm. Yeah. Hmm. And it it doesn't have to be strong  also. Only the feel. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. The buttons can be made of an uh a soft material. Because people like that. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Well um nah the method um we will um include the buttons as we discussed uh earlier. Um an L_C_D_ s screen will be implemented. Um we must decide where  this meeting. Um there are new developments in speech recognition um systems  um and they are already being uh used on uh coffee machines. And um well they're cheap  so we could use them now. Um it's not really speech recognition  it's more um like you can um talk to the chip  uh record the message and record an answer  and then once you uh talk to the remote  then um he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left. So if I say hi Mike  and you have recorded uh hi Mike back  then you will get that. No it doesn't does not do anything. But i it's just a Yeah it's it's cheap. No but that's the gadget they want  or the gimmicks. Yes  we we should really uh include that one  I think. Um Well  as I said uh earlier I think the uh L_C_D_ screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote. Um the buttons for screen width and general settings and uh and that kind of stuff um we can also do let that kind of functions um be shown in the L_C_D_ screen  uh instead of uh extra buttons. I think young people and yeah w well every user would like that. Um the buttons um should be positioned uh positioned the same way as they are on a  well  conventional remote  I think. For the learnability and uh well to keep it recognisable. A voice recognition can be uh implemented. And uh I drew an example  but it did not work quite the well uh the way I wanted it to do. Hmm? Well I have the I can draw it again  and I know what I did wrong. I didn't tick the note bo box in the. Um Um with the uh the up and down and and well buttons and the Well I will draw what I had drawn on the screen. Yes. Um I shall draw this. If it uh works. Mm so have I. Nah. Well these little buttons are a bit difficult to uh draw uh correct. Yeah just uh the numbers. These these will be bigger in the the real design. This must be the Okay button used to uh interact with the L_C_D_ screen. And with this you can uh  yes  go to through the menus and that can Um the video button should be uh an apart button  because you want it to uh t  yeah  to use it fast within one uh click. Um it's Hmm? This button can also be the Menu button  we use in the menus Well we we can add another button here  but Yeah. Ah right. Well you you No no  we we we should uh add uh a extra Menu button and this the Okay button. Ah once you have an extra Menu button  you don't need that that extra option. You have uh redundancy. Yeah  if we decide to uh to implement that  maybe we should. Well they that could be anywhere. That's very small. It could be uh down here. Um. Well  not here. I yeah I suggest here. But that's just a little gap. Yeah. Well the speaker and the microphone  I think  are the same uh little hole thingy. Yeah. Well i Um there are a all already being implemented in in coffee machines  so they won't be uh very expensive. But This is my suggested design. Um Yes. And oh I think as you can see so  the L_C_D_ screen does look better uh at the lower end  or at the bottom. But Oh  um I had some uh examples. You can uh But I did not like it very much  but Well these are quite obvious  very ugly remote. Um No  well th Yeah. Well not all. Uh this is for children but th No. W but with the colours i it's a bit the way we're going to. Well this is a terrible Um this looks Yeah. This uh these are the L_C_D_ screens. I think we should  if it's um possible  uh one with colours  but I don't know uh Too expensive? Alright. Well Nah. Ha  even more. N Well Yeah  this is what we've just done. Right? Ah right. Not everything. Yeah but all these examples are uh of a coffee machine. I think we Why don't we um use uh titanium or or a hard  yeah  some kind of metal for the uh the the whole remote except the front. That Just like um most cell phones are. Yeah. Yeah. No but you you have this Yeah. Yeah  you have the re remote in your hand like this. So you feel titanium. Yeah. And I don't know if you can make steel just any way you want it to. Yeah. Well any colour Yeah  then you you paint it in the colour you want it. The plastic is is the colour you want it. So Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Well titanium is neutral. Hmm. Yeah. Well Our customers will use those uh funky uh trendy colours  and they don't use uh wood. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. The electrical cable uh does No we don't use an electrical cable. Yeah inside  but this is for the coffee uh machine. Yeah  but that's not what's meant here  I think. Yeah. Well I got a better one here and I will um The shared folder. I will work this out uh for the uh next meeting. Yeah yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah that's the whole idea of the front. Yes. But that's for later on. The fronts y you can do anything with them. Yeah  right For the uh initiative uh launch. Mm. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well you can you can give them uh s s three or so  so that they can uh experiment with it and that they want more. Yeah. Red red  blue and green you give them or something  and then you can give them uh other ones. Yeah we should do that. Mm. Yeah  we can do that. But bu we stay we stay here or something? Ah right. And take it to our rooms and uh Ah  specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach. Yeah. Um Will we use uh round buttons or square ones for the for the numbers? Yeah I I I also uh thought Yeah. And these uh these s these buttons uh are more uh triangle-ish shaped with a square one in the middle. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Well most of the time uh up and down is programme and left and right are volume  I think. Yeah  it depends  but If you turn up the volume  you always see this thingy go up. Yeah. Yeah alright. Mm. Uh I I'd say only the logo. Too much text and it gets too too busy. Well it's quite a long phrase. Ah the logo should be on the top I think. Right corner  yes. uh the text? Yeah. Uh yeah  at the back? Well you c Well uh Yes. You can The logo can be on on every uh front. Yeah  but then you must uh really uh yeah push it in or something. Yeah  on the backside. Well n n not not on the front side  I think. On the back Yes  you you can  yeah  push that in  so that it is always be there. Yeah. Yeah I think over here the logo. Yes we could No  they have two fronts  that. You you can Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No  you can you can just And then not a straight line but uh some sort of wave or something. This is titanium. And this is uh F front. Yeah. With the with the curved edge. Yeah. Yeah. Tada. Yeah. Ah. Yeah  that's nice finishing touch you need. Yeah  this is the front. This is the My design. Yeah. We'll stay here I guess? Well we can uh erase an animal I guess. Uh the fourth one. Uh the fourth one is empty  isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah I think we have to wait? Maybe. Yeah. Aha. This has no function. We've done too much in the previous meetings. Yes  we've got nothing to do now. Its the best remote ever. Pinball. Yes  but you you get really close to the screen with your hand  and I don't think that's Hmm. We can better uh draw a design on this. Yeah  but we can't. Well We'll stay here? Or we'll get the email. Yeah. Well we'll wait a few seconds and then we'll get an email. Yeah. Okay. Uh door is closed. Well  let's begin. Because if we have as much time as the last uh meeting  we'll have to hurry up. Um well I'll start with the presentation again  the agenda. Yo. So. Uh This one I think. Uh yeah. Well alright. Um well  I'll show you the notes. It's not as uh interesting as it should be because we just uh had the meeting  but I'll show them. We'll get your presentations again on the conceptual design. Um Then we'll have to dec decide about the control  the remote control concepts. I've put a f uh a file in the project management folder  which says exactly uh what kind of decisions we should take. So this time we exactly know what to decide about. And then we'll close again. Uh Well these are some examples  but we'll talk about them later. We'll first look at your uh presentations. Alright? Walter will uh start again this time? Yo. 'Kay. 'Kay. Less. Well  yeah. L_C_D_ and our uh our fronts. Well  easy to use uh s is a bit uh contradictionary with the first uh Functional is not an issue  and then easy to use. Well we have to choose one of them. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. We'll we'll look at uh. 'Kay. So Well Yeah  well Yeah. B Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year. Th this year it's fruits but next year it's it's something totally different. Yes. Yep  alright. Wood is popular. Aha. Yeah yeah yeah. Alright. Nice  uh well show us. Well maybe it it it is  but it doesn't look strong. So maybe But we still have to look at our price of course. Because uh if we want an L_C_D_ uh window etcetera uh Yeah? Yes. Sports uh  they're uh that uh are accessible on on your L_C_D_ uh window uh Huh? That's nice. All the results? Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Nai. Uh no. It's t terrible. Alright. Hmm? Yeah  alright. Yeah. And it's round. Well you can make th th th that middle ring can you you can make another colour. So uh those kind of things you can you can combine. No  it isn't. Okay. Yes. So  if you ti Well You you Maybe you should have uh some some coloured titanium or something. So it it looks pretty but it feels strong. No titanium. What do you exactly mean with double curved? Double curved? It it mean Yeah  well okay. Well This soft material thing from uh Yeah. Alright. Okay. We will take that. And then uh Mike? Okay. Oh That's interesting. Okay. But you can also say that  when you say something  it does some function. Oh. That's a bit uh Yes. I understand. But it has no functionality for our remote at all. Hmm. So you put a menu in the L_C_D_? Ah. But then we should also have an uh an Okay button. Just uh There is already a blank. Yes? So Yeah. No m Next year that's out. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. And what's the menu button? But how did How do you get out of the menu then? Yeah. Maybe I you could j just do an an exit with Okay. Uh Yes  well but bec because when you push Menu you get in  and then you have to push Okay when you get to a choice. And Well that's also the Okay button. That's you you should have uh Or you can put in the L_C_D_'s uh window an option Get Out. Exit. Well  it's just a choice. Huh? Yeah? Okay. Well  okay  alright. Um then let's have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make. I'd I agree. Fine. Yeah. Yes? Too big. They're all black. Hey  that one I like. No. The remote. Terrible. It's it's all too much buttons. Too many buttons. That's Well  that's too expensive I think. Alright. Yeah. Okay. Huh. Mm no. 'Kay. No  not very strange. It still has t Yes. Th a a kind of bridge. So it f falls over the hand. Yeah? Yeah? Yeah. Well I have at home a remote with a bridge. It's just a half round half half circle at And then it falls exactly over the hand  and that's very nice. That's It feels comfortable. Yeah. Yeah  alright. Um where did I put it? Um conceptual phase  I think this is it. I got this from our friends. So Uh yeah the conceptual design. These are a few examples which we have to decide about. All the the materials from the case  uh the electric cable that's all your uh your side of the story. Um Yeah. Um now from the user interface  your uh package? Um where No well  that's more like the buttons where they have to come. And um B a bit of  yeah well  a bit of uh design. Yes  but we have to decide about these now. And uh the trend-watching. So as you said  fruity is in  well sells good. Wow. Uh these things. Uh yes. Um so if we uh go through them Yeah well uh Why should I uh Yeah. So What what kind of properties should it have? Well we just listened. You know what? Alright. I've uh Titanium back  plastic front. Okay. Um well I am going to put it in here  uh because we can uh look. I Um solid feel and trendy look. So material  um hard plastic for the front? Okay. And well the the electrical cable is just normal uh. It's uh from uh our coffee uh Of course. Well uh all the all the inside work of our remote is uh standard work. So The chip is normal silicon. Uh the buttons are normal  etcetera. Okay? So that's just easy. Uh we decide about that just by looking at our competitors and our earlier uh remotes. The conceptual specification of the user interface? Um well we have our beautiful drawing. Well you can put that in uh into the shared folder  and then I'll put it in our end report. Yes  you can Mm yeah. You can uh put some uh which button is what. Okay. Um the trend-watching included these days. And what do we? We thing that fruit and bright colours are Yes. We can also uh implement um we can also implement fronts from um movies that are very hot. Uh those kind of things. Yeah. Launch different lines at once. We should not give them the m the most lovely front when they buy it for the first time. Yeah. Come on. We still have to make those fifty million  yeah?. The most ugly. Two. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Um well the buttons etcetera  we get from Mike. Uh this fruit and bright colours  yeah well I think we'll have to in the next uh half an hour  we'll have to uh s s specify the different uh types we want to launch  when we uh well introduce our remote. Yes. Yes. Well I'll have to  before I get another warning for five minutes  I'm going to get Where is my mouse? Uh where is my mouse? Oh yeah. Um this is it. Well  um this we have. Uh basic stuff. Interface we have. Supplements  L_C_D_. Maybe a a cheap voice recording. Well Yes. Alright. Individual actions. Industry designer . User Interface  Mike. You're going to work together on a prototype drawing on the SMARTboard. That's what I got uh to hear. Yes well we'll get it to hear that I think. But I think so. Th they're saying SMARTboard and that's it This is the SMARTboard  so Um so you can uh you you are going to make a prototype  and y Well that's includes uh specifying the buttons etcetera. Yeah. So you'll get it on your em on your laptop. Um well you will go and do something else uh on the project yeah project evaluation. So um  what are you going to do? Uh I don't know what product evaluation exactly means  but uh you'll get uh the specifications. Yeah. That's why I uh But uh How long do we still have? Yeah. Why does Ah f fuck you. Heh? We can't get Ts It doesn't work any more. We can't save them. So we'll just have them uh standing there. No. It's a bit uh bit a pity. Well we still have uh more than five minutes. Um So what are we going to do? I as Project Manager ha don't have a clue. Oh we can uh decide how we implement the feeling from our company into the remote. Also the slogan? On the We put the fashion in electronics. We put the fashion in electronics. On the top. Yeah. Well in in in the right top corner? And well you c On the back  you can put uh h At the bottom  you can put the logo with the Yeah. Just just small. Yeah well Carved into the material. No  you you can carve it into the titanium at the back. Well  management would like it. The front side  no no l no slogan. Sorry. Yes  slogan from company on the back with logo and logo also on the front but not exchange uh Uh? Hmm? Uh when changing fronts. Alright  that's decided. Five minutes left. So a bit of titanium between? That's a bit Oh that that's that's pretty cool. No? Yes. I already have uh all kinds of uh filth between the mobile. Yeah. Round forms. Yep. Yeah. What? So round where? Oh  yeah. Yes  that also sounds uh pretty uh neat. We want it. And it's only f twenty five Euros. Come on. No that's nothing. The Phillips remote uh costs more. Well uh you two are going to work together. You'll get your uh specifications on your uh laptop  and then uh you uh Well I think we can  I just It's Yeah  o Oh Oh  we have a one. So  you can uh draw a Yeah. Well I'll get a I'll get the message. No  I think uh Well you'll Maybe you can uh keep your uh laptop here. Or get your mouse. Because it's little bit uh hard to work with these uh plates. I always have a mouse next to my laptop. I hate these Ugh. And in your remote control. So we put a touch pad on it  and say ha ha. Yeah. We know you'll you'll you'll hate it but But they do want some gadgets. So that's wha what we're doing. Well we won't. Our bosses will be rich. Well  that's not bad  is it? Mm. So Oh. Oh he's totally off again. Well But when I start here  it's here. So is it Nope. Yeah. Let's go. Finish the meeting now. Alright now we know what to do  so Um Message? No  get away. Um I I'm not sure. Maybe you Yeah. Well you'll have to work on this one. Yeah. That's a good idea. Well Good luck. ,The project manager opens the meeting by stating the agenda. The designers give the prototype presentation  showing their simple design that is based on a mango. They point out the company logo and LED  and demonstrate how the device is palm-held and thumb-acessible. They also discuss the numerical  volume  channel  and power buttons as well as the color scheme. The marketing expert administers the product evaluation  and they rate each of the ten criteria on a scale of 1-7. The criteria includes fancy look-and-feel  technological innovation  ease of use  look  whether people would be willing to spend 25 Euros for it  whether its operating behavior matches the average user  ease of finding when lost  ease of learning to use  whether it will minimize RSI  incorporation of company colors and logo  and whether it follows the motto. They average the scores and get 1.9. They check the product costing and find that their operating cost is 12.20 Euros. In evaluating the project process they are pleased with their creativity  leadership  timing  teamwork  discussions  and overall product given the resources they had. They close the meeting by thanking one another. 
Yep. Yes. Mm. Uh the Powerstick. Maybe a Spanish name would work well. Especially if we're selling into the U_S_ market becasue there's a lot of Spanish speakers there. Maybe something that sounds cool in English but sounds funny in Spanish. Mando. What is that? What does it mean in Spanish? Control. Okay. 'Cause it also like in English it sounds like you know the man's tool you know because you know men like to have control of the remote so it might The Mando. Yeah that's. And we could have some like you d you could have the fonts you know special  so you have man in like in in uh in one o in one font and then the O_ as like Although you don't wanna cut uh cut women out of the uh potential buyers though  do you? So Yeah. Marketing. Well that's the thing. We need to know who we're selling it to before we can really decide on a Um. Yeah. More likely. Well th the on the thing is though  most remote controls are used by more than one person. So unless you're kind of targeting single people you know you're gonna maybe cut out some a lot of your market. Still shaped for yeah for your hand but not for a particular hand  right? Well it can still be a  you can still extend past the hand. Uh. Well it means like  this remote here is kind of is very thin and long so instead of having you know you might have it kind of a bit bigger or  you know  with maybe some some finger molds or something. Some finger grips maybe. You could even have some buttons like you know on the sides and everything  but Yeah. Yeah. No. I was still uh I was still working on this uh twenty five Euro price point because I think actually having looked at some of the remotes out there  this is quite a low uh price if if we're maybe I can get to this in my presentation though  but um yeah. Yep. Okay. Yeah. I think even even if it was within budget do a speech reco rec system it might be a bit difficult because if you think if you're watching T_V_ you're gonna have a lot of this uh background noise from the T_V_ which might interfere with the Uh participant three. You might have some background noise from the T_V_ which will make the speech recognition much uh harder  so. Oh you press a press a button to talk  and the the T_V_ the T_V_ sound turns off. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Okay  so  could I describe the mouse maybe be easier to could I use the mouse  or Mm. Thanks. Okay. Great. Okay so um while uh researching this this topic I first of all just thought of a couple of things that I would like to see in a remote  and just uh looked to see if they're actually available in any current remotes  and then also searched for which are the top-rated uh remote controls on Epinions dot com  which is a a you know a a customer um written basically review site. So um there's a pretty wide range of uh remote controls these days and and uh this remote control on the right here is is one of the more extravagant  but it's not really it's by no means uh mm you know on it's own in being so expensive. There are a lot of expensive remote controls out there. So yeah it doe it's well basically all the functions uh are controlled through through the L_C_D_ screen except for the really really kind of main functions  which have a couple of of their own buttons. Um and if you look at a lot of the universal remotes out um on the market  I know we're working on television remote  but a lot of the universal remotes out there have uh have these L_C_D_ screens which kind of helps when you're using multiple uh devices I suppose because you can have multiple kind of functions d different functions on the screen at different times. But um the thing that I find most interesting about this remote control  and it's kind of difficult to uh to see in the slide  but it has a scroll wheel on it  which is kind of like uh a mouse scroll wheel  which I think is it's a really kind of important design aspect um is it's 'Cause the thing is what a what we the presen this presentation we had is what we want the remote control to actually do. And obviously the the simplest thing that a remote control does is it just change the change the channel. Now um uh the I think that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of of changing the channel. 'Cause I know when I um when I use the remote to change the channel I very rarely use the numbers on the on the pad. I usually use the up and down because most channels are you know two digit numbers and you have to press you know a special button to enter a two-digit number  and then two numbers  so that's just uh it's annoying. So I think a scroll wheel is is quite handy. Now um the the scroll wheel is is much more useful if you have an L_C_D_ screen  and this brings us to the the point you were mentioning before about the internet uh capability. One possibility  if we now we need to still talk about the price point because obviously a lot of this stuff can't be done for twenty five Eu uh Euro  but one possibility is to download program information into the L_C_D_ screen so that instead of actually saying I want to I want to go to channel thirty seven because I know this programme's on  you know  often you don't know what ch what channel it's on  or you don't know what's on. If you have a list of of programs on your L_C_D_ screen you just scroll to that program rather than to a channel. So if you think about it's kind of like a you know in mobile phones now you don't use you don't remember people's phone number  you remember their name and you go find that name and ring it. So this would be pretty kind of a handy thing to have  but um we we really need t to discuss the price. So  I mean there are there are uh cheaper this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it's it's it's very simple  there's only a few buttons  but al each of those buttons does something different in a different context. So this is something else we might wanna consider  is really kind of limiting the number of buttons  because this is the top rating uh universal remote control on on Epinions. It it's really uh maybe worth thinking about limiting the number of buttons as much as as possible um because really I think people want to be able to find the button they're looking for without even looking at the remote control. And was saying before about having different size buttons for different you know frequently used uh tasks  but I think also you know the location and and shape of the buttons is important  but also the number of buttons. So if you have too many buttons it it it increases the the difficulty of finding the one you want. So Yeah well we w Yeah well we will have a bit of a simpler uh task in that we're only doing uh a television remote control. Um I think maybe one option is to have you know a little flip-open um door that uh that you have hidden most of the time  but contains the extra buttons like  say  the number buttons for instance. Um I I would if I had my perfect remote control  I'd probably just have no numbers at all on it because they're just in the way. They don't really do anything. Maybe you know I although I do also find flip-open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break off or or whatever  but maybe a door that you can you can permanantly remove or permanantly have on would be good. Um but I think definitely you need to to keep the buttons down to a minimum  but not not let that kind of interfere with the functionality of of the device. Um Well I guess that depends on how you market it. If you if you have the right advertisement showing how how how easy it is and how you can  you know  navigate to a program without the numbers  then people might say that looks pretty easy. So  but yep. Um okay  so  I think um one of the really kind of useful things you can do with with internet connectivity would be to have this a programme driven interface rather than the channel number. So if we can have a higher priced uh remote control I think that would really be worth uh something that would be worth implementing. Um mm there's the L_C_D_ screen  um which maybe maybe is too expensive  um but I think also at the scroll wheel  I haven't mentioned it here  the scroll wheel could be used without an L_C_D_ screen  just for changing channel numbers easily. I think even that  I mean  that would be a fairly cheap thing  compared to an L_C_D_ screen  to implement  um but I think that would be quite useful as well. And the other thing  you say we need to we need to keep it just television  but I think one maybe one option  since this is supposed to be a kind of a fashionable device  is you know there's a certain kind of cool or wow factor that you can kind of you can have with technology  and maybe we wanna make it something that's extensible to do other tasks. Say you have like um a little another little kind of base unit that can also receive signals as well as the television where you can  say uh  change the lighting in the room. You know that would be something maybe you could sell as an extra  so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development  but  you know  later on you could you can you know you also  selling the potential of the device. Then you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like change the lights  I dunno  close the windows  whatever  turn the heating on  and um  I think that's something we may need to have as as at least as an optional extra to to kinda make our product cool  since we say we're putting the fashion in electronics. Hmm. Well one one other thing that that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is uh when you want to sell into other markets  though  because  I'm not sure exactly where we're gonna sell this  but I presume it's not gonna just be English speaking countries. So then you have to s you know  you have to train models for Yeah. You know I guess you could actually train the remote control as you're using it by saying you know turn volume up  and you press the uh press the button like uh s people teach sign language to kids f well  by speaking and doing Yeah. Actually I'm not so sure because I'm the you know if I was using a remote control to  say  turn the volume up because I can't hear it very well  I don't really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking you know when I'm when I'm instead of pressing up on on a remote control. You know if there's some there's some dialogue all of a sudden that I can't hear  I'm trying to actually find out what's being said  so maybe speech recognition gets in the way more than it helps. Well it depends if it's a remote control th Maybe if the remote control is something that y you don't actually have to pick up anymore  that would be a a useful feature of the speech recogntion. If you can leave it sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find it  then that could be. Well it depends though well it depends. If we we don't unless we have some input some video input to the T_V_ or we have control over the T_V_ then we can't actually display that. Like if we if we produce the T_V_s then then yeah we can put you know menus up up there  but otherwise we need to actually have some kind of something sitting in between the video signal and the and the T_V_ to superimpose those those menus. So that's an extra cost. Well this is this is another que we still haven't really defined the remote. Are we still you say we're focusing on T_V_  but is it still a kind of like a universal remote in that it's a replacement remote control  or is this something for our own line of of televisions? 'Cause that really makes a big difference. 'Cause even if we have contacts we can't really produce a remote control that can bring up menus on other other companies' T_V_s. It's just there are too many T_V_s out there. It's it's not really gonna For twenty five Euro? I think it's impossible. But but I dunno  I think um it would be good to know if there is any leverage in that any leeway in that um that twenty five Euro because for twenty five Euro I think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control  and that seems to be kind of against the philosophy of our company which is you know putting the fashion into electronics. So I would I would like to know if there's any chance of of increasing the uh of increasing the unit price. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah because yeah. Well th 'Cause you can have things like the programme name instead of the channel numbers  like an interactive programme guide. You can get a lot more information on it. So you could have the name of the programme  you could have um the start time you know where it's up to. You could have a l even a little image of you know the c you know the the m the main actors or something so you can quickly just kind of even without reading Well no  but there are the electronic programme guides out there. They may not have pictures  but maybe they do. There's dependi it also depends on the country. No but I mean with the internet you have flexibility of where you get your information from. So it may be possible that there are people out there providing that. Uh. Well I I think if we're gonna I think we would definitely need the internet connection because even with y I don't think you could even get teletext information from the T_V_ onto the remote control  especially if we don't control the T_V_. I dunno. We need to find that out. Mm. If it's a really small T_V_ maybe. Well the thing is I think I think the type of peop I think the type of people that are gonna want to buy a very stylish rem r remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gonna have you know a wireless internet connection maybe  or a you know. Well this is what we need to find out. Can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control? 'Cause otherwise we need It's kind of hard to guarantee that you're gonna Ninety five percent is not good enough though. Yep. Uh. Mm I was thinking of the Mando. Mando. A_N_ yeah D_O. It doesn't it doesn't sound cool for me  but maybe for a Spanish for I for Control. But mm  yeah. Mando sounds Latino. But yeah it uh Yeah because if the product will be international Maybe maybe I should uh start. Yeah. Mm. Okay. Yeah. Should be in participant four. Yeah  yeah. Uh. Okay so yeah I will I will give a brief outline about what I what I prepared for this meeting. For the functional requirements and especially for the for the user requirements. I prepare a marketing report and we have to find the weaknesses and and the the improvements we could do to the current remote controls. And also I di I did a study with for the incorporation of new technologies it seems that the remote controls have been have remained the same for the last five  ten years. There is no no significant difference between the the b the first new controls and Yeah. Yeah. Well more most of the people think that remote controls are ugly  thoroughly. So and they they admit that the the they should uh s they would uh spend more money in a fancier remote control  which is which is good and it's interesting point. Also the people are worried about about the R_S_I_ disease  which is if you repeat the sa the same movement  which is not a with a not very appropriate device  you you will have problems whe when you will get old. So s people are uh are worried about the the shape of the of the remote control. They are also they get angry very often because they lost the remote control very often  so I think it would be a good point to to l to to find a a solution to any beep any alarm or something incorporated to with the remote control every time it it get lost. And also I found that young people the the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the in the remote control. So in my opinion the Mando this Mando shouldn't be very small because the smaller it is  the more like the the liklier it is to get lost. Liklier or more likely? likely. Okay. Uh people also complain because they they they all have the same size of the buttons for buttons who w which are not very use like f uh memorising channels or or this kind of actions which are not very often but they they shouldn't they shouldn't have the same importance in the in the uh in the remote cont in the remote control. Also the z the design should fit the hand shape. So it may be interesting to to think in a in both prototypes  for right and left handed people. Yeah. I dunno I th Anyway I think it could be int interesting to to release some a a small fraction of of this remote controls. Sorry? Yeah. Yeah. Sorry? Yeah. Like uh Yeah  like No no I was thinking of so like something yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah. It sh it shouldn't it shouldn't be symmetric symmetrical. Not anymore. That's what yeah. And finally  the incorporation of a L_C_D_ or a speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting  but I don't know if the budget would be large enough. But most of yeah most of the young people to thirty to thirty years old were really interested in this kind of technology. Actually this marketing report is restricted to T_V_ remote controls. Yeah but you should be able to activate or disactivate  so yeah yeah. Yeah uh channel fifty. Yeah. H I think I think that the tr the transition to this to this new remote control shouldn't be very very abrupt very hard because w if people see a remo see the see a remote control without numbers mm they will think it's very difficult to learn very difficult to very different build very different to the traditional If y I'm sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five Euros everyo everyone will s will buy it. I'm sure. Yeah but you know the the average frequency of pushing buttons  it's about it's about eighty eighty eighty pushes per hour  or something like that. With a good shape for the Yeah. Uh What would be Wha but what would be one question  what would be the goal of putting an L_C_D_ in a remote control? What what kind of information? Yeah but mo most of the T_V_s nowadays show the show the the n Yeah but yeah most of the T_V_s have teletext nowadays. Yeah. So what would what would appear in the in the L_C_D_? Okay. But Yeah. I think that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper the than the L_C_D_. Because with the L_C_D_ you need more requirements. You need a internet connection. You need m more things. But for the speech recognition you you don't need anything. You just say channel fifty  and that's it. But then we should move to another target b because at twenty five Dollars  it's To move to another target? the expert uh said ninety five percent. Yep. Yeah. Yep. Mm-hmm. Yeah  yeah. Yeah they are the most T_V_ watcher. So we should be careful. Yep. Well maybe it could be a universal design. A universal design  which is which is good for both the hands. Yeah? That's right  whether it's left hand or right hand  but but don't you think that the two points are clashing  one thing you are saying design should fit the hand shape and it should not be very small? The first and the third point  they are clashing. Okay. So fitting the hand doesn't mean much then. Mm-hmm mm-hmm. Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm. So it means design should be similar to the traditional ones? Little sleek  longer? And it should fit the hand. Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm. Mm-hm mm-hmm mm-hmm. No it could be command control kind of thing. It requir recognises particular sequence and then it gets activated. Means you say you should say like does that  remote control being on or be on kind of thing  and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition. Because this kind of thing means speech is there from the T_V_ also. So there should be something command controlled  you start and then you stop. It's like V_I_ editor  you are having two modes similarly. Otherwise it's just lying idle. Change the channels. Yeah. Mmm-hmm mm-hmm. Yeah yeah. But there is one problem then the user has to understand each of that functionality. Because the same button is doing too many things. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. It does sampling out of the. Yep. So yeah. So most of the things which we are discussing about is speech recognition uh  that means on my own I yeah  it should be. Two. Okay so the working design is uh user i interface could be of two types  one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing doing some he is knowing about that technology. So he is pretty comfortable if he wants to get this  and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being sitting on the on the remote. So the old kind of users who don't want to have any changes  it can it can be useful for them  and the new users  as uh our Marketing Expert was saying  they can use the new gizmo which is speech recognition kind of thing. That's right. So anyway  that didn't come into my mind  so th that is a possibility. These could be other kind of interfaces. Means we can have  depending on the cost  how much we can afford  we can have different kind of interfaces. So spe buttons are something which is very everybody is familiar with. So if you go to the market and you say that buttons are there the people know what it is  and on top of that if we are having extra functionality people are willing to shell that twenty-five Euros money which we are thinking. Otherwise we are just like others in the market. So anyway that is the first  user interface could be of more than one type  and uh yeah that means we can do the on-line changes which which cannot be done now actually. So apart from the speech  we can have the scroll kind of thing with the buttons. Now for buttons  normal requirements like bit coding and all those things are required. And for voice  limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote. Uh that's right. But uh means we have to see how much what kind of microphones and stuff like that. Uh yes  if it is limited vocabulary usually it's enough. Yeah we we can uh target  means we can target ninety five percent accuracy or somewhere ninety seven perc That's right. No it it could be little d yeah it could be That's right. That's right. Mm-hmm mm-hmm. Uh it's more like  means there are different speech technologies which are existing so D_T_W_ could be kind of which is the easiest. So you have to store some templates on the on the on the chip itself  and it's just dynamic time warping where you try to find out what it is  instead of having a model which has to be trained and being a micro-controller. Yeah  that's right. Yeah. So we can That's right. Yep. Yep. No no. Components. Yeah. So  will you go to the next slide? Yeah so this is the design which we are thinking so. We are having a power button and the switch  which is not much  and then we are having the which is to indicate whether the power is on or not. And then there are two kind of things which can be so one is the button interface which has not been shown because because of lack of time. So we could not put that. So now where the A_S_R_ decoder is sitting  similarly there are different kind of interfaces which could be there. So there is A_S_R_ decoder which could be there  and then there could be another scroll button scroll scroller  and then there could be buttons  and all of them they will just do the decoding and put it in the math put it in the proper message format. And then there is there is the chip which is sitting  the green one  and it converts it into bit codes  and that bit codes are sent by the infrared device to the receiver. So this is the easiest design the there could be. So th an A_S_R_ decoder we can have things in. To have different technologies. So this was the my personal preference was that we can have A_S_R_ sitting there on the remote control. Yeah. Yeah but uh as soon as you try to put the microchip kind of thing or something the price will go up. So these are the slight problems. Because yeah the reason is that if we go into the market means though I don't have much idea  but as he the uh Marketing Expert presentation was So if we go with just the Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Alright. It's not possible. It's impossible. Are But just a small thing  what kind of market we are targeting? Is it that we are targeting the replacement remote market  or what? So the remote has gone bad and the person wants to buy a new remote or because the cost of L_C_D_ thing could be as high as the T_V_ itself. That is very important. Broke. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. It's it's cheaper as compared to the L_C_D_. Means th yeah twenty five Euros is yeah  that's right. Okay. Okay everybody is ready? Good morning again. So  today we are going to have a f second meeting. Oh Michael  hi. You're late. You have a good reason for that? Very good. Okay  let's have a look to the agenda today. So  we are going to have a meeting about the functional design. Um so first before starting I w just going to uh to go quickly to through the minutes of previous meeting. So uh basically we we are not decided if w we should go for a universal or specific uh uh remote control  but I have new um new i inputs for about that topics. I goin I'm going to share with you. And uh basically we decided to um to uh go to individual actions for each of you uh so um Industrial Designer should wor was supposed to work on th on th on the working design. You showed us you ar you you prepare something for us? The U_I_ guy also uh work on that  yeah  and for the mar our Marketing Expert should deliver some specs. Alright so so we are going to go through three of your individual presentations. But first I would like quickly to uh to decide of to give a name to the project. So  I just put d quickly Remo  but if you have any o other names that we co could decide for just to to keep something fun for our project we we should we could discuss quickly. Any ideas? Powerstick  yeah. What else? What else? Mango? Mango? Mando. M_A_? M_A_? M_ D_O_. Mm  okay. What does it mean? Oh. Hmm. Nice. Okay. So  let's go for Mando? Yeah? No objection? Great. So Okay  I think this is Okay. Okay  I think this is more a question of of I I think this is more a question of of look and feel. Something that should be addressed later. We should we should go to other for the other topics. Yeah okay  so let's stick f to Man Mando for the name and we'll see for the for the look and feel later. So let's go for the three presentations right now. So  who want to start? So maybe we could start with the market  yeah. Okay so I have your slides somewhere? Participant four. This one? S that's coming. Uh okay. Great. Mm-hmm. Okay. Sh next slide? Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. Something with the shape of the palm? On the sides. And then finally Yeah. First I'm just wondering about the L_C_D_ stuff because uh because Yeah  so maybe it's a good time for me to uh to bring you to some new uh new informations. We had the new requirements from the so uh from the head offices of the company  and so they wanted so they want to um they would like to be restricted to T_V_. Okay  I dunno if you had this information already. No  so they want us to restrict the remote control to T_V_ only because of time limitations. Um they want also uh Excellent. So we have also to focus more on the internet aspects because well well te teletext is outdated now and uh finally  it should be clear that the corporate image  that means colours and logos of the co our company should be clearly inde identified in the product. So Yeah yeah. Sure sure. So maybe we can jump to your presentations  right now. Okay so let's keep in mind about tha that that this last point about L_C_D_ and speech uh reco Sorry  what is your? Okay Michael. Sorry? Um yeah. The wheel doesn't work. Looks like a P_D_A_? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay  can you continue  please Mi? Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay  thanks. you want to go? This one? Great. No  not that one. you are two. Alright. Okay  sorry to interrupt you  but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. That increases the the cost also. Do you think that performance of such systems are enough to to target well of such technologies is enough? Okay. Well wh uh I imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance um a um an ambience microphones because you are not going to speak into into th into the remote control. So it could be s a few centimetres. Yeah. Okay. Okay we shou we should discuss this la later after after after this this uh slide. This is a this is a this is a a very important uh issue in discussion. Okay  next. Uh that finished? No? Components? Yes sure. Okay. Okay. So your your opinion is that we should go for special condition technologies? Yeah. Okay so Okay gentlemens  we have to take some deci decisions right now. Um so if I if I kind of summarise everything we've de we we said. We are targeting T_V_. We need we need to have um um remote control which is fanc fancy  which is uh which is easy to to hand not too small  not too big. Um we have or good shape  yes. We should bring new technologies for young peoples  and uh as we have uh also requirements to to use uh to to push thr toward the internet. Maybe this is something we can stick to it. And um also  a very interesting things I I I've seen on on on the one of the comp o our competitor is this wheel that we can use to navigate. So so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price  it's not possible to go s to go to L_C_D_ and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies. Uh first m m why not to go to L_C_D_. Because um in fact as we are targeting uh T_V_ in fact we can use T_V_ screen as a screen to feedback to to give some feedback informations about what we could have. Yeah that's right. Don don't you ha don't we have contacts with uh people on T_V_ or or well systems that exist that we can use? Yeah. Yeah. That's good point. What's what cou what could be the cost of uh well  could we fit the the targets uh in terms of cost uh if we go s to L_C_D_ on the remote control? Yeah. So you mean yo you mean we we should target something maybe which is which would be more expensive but re really fancy in terms to um in terms to had to have really an added value? Okay  so regarding the automatic speech recognition  I think this is They have tele teletext. Well  because they have teletext on it. Th th you have a teletext sin signal that you can that you can uh that you can get thr through the channel. They have t most of them have teletext  but we want to get rid well one of our requirements is to uh to move to teletext to uh to the use of internet. So to to uh to browse more easily the teletext. For instance through uh through your remote control. The ti the start time  all the p all the programmes you could have uh o Well I don't know if this information is available from teletext  also. Well because for the same reason that we cannot uh informations on the T_V_. We c we couldn't grab information information which is not there. So so that mean w w we need an in an extra internet connection to use the remote control  if you want to browse  in addition to the T_V_  or uh or it should be a special T_V_ connected to Okay. We need to close the meeting. Um so Very quickly. No. Yeah  well people go to buy another remote control when they broke n broke their  and they want to go t for universal one  and they take the fanciest they can have. So this is that we z that that we should target. So the com the um the uh the committment is the following  we don't go for speech recognition technology. The L_C_D_ is still on disc is still open to discussion. It is up to you to go through this um uh this way and to to report report me back next meeting. So Yeah  but not sure. Maybe it's cheaper  but we have no Okay this is this is an open question for you. Yeah. This is uh up to you to tell us. But I'm definitely not keen on to to no no no  I'm no I'm definit definitely not keen on going to speech recognition technologies. I'm not confident enough. I'm not sure that that we'll have a product really that work. I uh that work It's real yeah. How to guarantee such performances is really hard. Well this is still is is very bad. So  this is the end of this discussion. Next meeting uh here are the task you have to work on. Um so you have to work on the component uh concept. Uh you have to work on user interface  and you have to go through a trend watching. Okay. So the question is still open about the L_C_D_ thing. Um uh we I hope that next meeting we will uh we'll take some um decision that direction. Thanks. Bye. ,The marketing expert and industrial designer had problems with their laptops. The project manager opened the meeting and introduced the project  to design a remote control. The remote should be trendy  original and user friendly. The project manager explained how to use the SMARTboard  and the group did a tool training exercise  using the SMARTboard to draw their favourite animals. The project manager talked about the budget and projected profit. The group discussed initial ideas for the remote  including that it should be a simple design with grouped buttons. They discussed whether the remote should include functions for controlling video and DVD players. The project manager went over the roles of the participants and closed the meeting. 
Mm-hmm. Maybe you should try to write on the on the big white uh Does it? Yeah. It works. Wonderful. Mm-hmm.. Alright  yep. I hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your uh I hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your personal uh enjoyment. I I I I understand. Alright. so start Yep yes. Don't uh count on it. I think it's a mouse or a rat. Oh. Oh I know it. It's a hedgehog. Well I'm amazed uh about your uh drawing skills. Yeah. I am the Industrial Designer. Chief  I am the Industrial Designer. Yeah. I think It's pr it resembles the animal drawn by. I think can I say it? It looks amazing. These are very impor These are very important documents  of course  uh these drawings  uh And he deliberately draws a animal we don't know the English word for. It looks like an uh It looks like that beast from Sesame Street. Yeah. It's it's uh Do we have to uh But we have uh do we have to name the specific species of the bird? No? Well wonderful. Why do I have to do the difficult tasks? Uh pen yeah that's. Uh current colour. I like uh oh they don't have pink. Oh b oh think this is uh Uh? Uh Line width. Uh fifteen. And I can draw? Uh Oh the line width is too thick  but oh well. Uh. It smiles nicely. Now I have to change the line width. Uh one. These are whiskers  you know. Uh well I think it's obvious right now. Miaow. Well if this isn't obvious I'll save it alright uh save. Uh yeah uh blank. Well I feel comfortable now. Thanks for this exercise. I feel totally at ease. Yeah something like that. So Alright. Well I I didn't have to prepare anything about uh it's not  it's it's not my task to uh talk about uh experience with current remote controls  but uh Mm-hmm. No but uh the b the buttons have to uh have to have uh international recognisable buttons and uh and numbers and uh that every culture in uh  yeah  people in every country can recognise. Alright. Yeah so it doesn't uh become too complicated with too much buttons and uh And stereo uh s uh audio installations. Most people do  yeah. It doesn't it doesn't have to be Yeah. Well. Hmm. It has to be different and familiar at the same time. yeah the shape will will have to be recognised. I thought about uh like most uh remote controls uh are uh a long box shaped thing you can make it uh triangle shaped  but that's not uh very recognisable. Oval? I Mm. Oh but it ha it has to be m yeah. But you still have to know it's a remote and not another Yeah. Yeah so the long box uh shaped thing must be uh  yeah  useful or else uh they would have been ano another shape. Yeah. Yeah a lo the long box shape yeah. You have to use one hand. Why not? But it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this  and you can make it another shape  but then you have W no w what else? I di Yeah well but uh what what what do you suggest then? Hmm. Well but it's still then uh the the long box  uh but then with some uh round uh round forms in it to fit your hand  but it's it's still Yeah yeah al alright but but it's still it's still sort of box  yeah. It it has round forms but it in the end it's still the box  so that's what I mean. Yeah yeah I understand  but no no I don't mean an entire box like completely square but a also with round edges of course  but in in in at the end it's still this long box shape with convenient uh round uh shapes uh to fit. Yeah yes I thought about something like that. Yeah. A big recognisable button on top or something. The buttons should uh also be not too small  not too big  of course  and uh n uh uh not too close uh together. Uh-huh. Yeah of course uh to uh to uh to have icons to explain the different functions. Yeah. Colours  yeah. I think we have to talk also about uh the the materials for um. Already thought about something tha Mm-hmm. Yeah now we can still talk about the material  we have some some minutes left uh I w wrote down uh that the case should be plastic of course  hard plastic  the buttons should be uh rubbery I think uh. No n n Mm. Alright. And of course there are several electrical cables in it to uh to connect things uh to each other. I think so. It's a a common stan standard way infrared beams an infrared beam I think. It it's a we we make an a universal remote so it ha has to work with uh all kinds of brands and things. And have well yeah I've wrote something down about how it works. The user presses a button and with an infrared beam it signals the television set accordingly  but that's pretty obvious  I think. Well but th but the standard front will be uh just grey or something uh b a simple colour not not very flashy. Pink television sets pink remote . Alright. I must not forget my pen the next time. Mm yeah also the the look and feel uh of the the remote's also my task  yeah. Yeah I uh w was wondering that too. Y you went to the company website. It's the the the start uh starting page uh Very handy to know. Right see you in half an hour then. W Right uh see you in thirty minutes then. I dunno. Throwing away my toothpick. 'Kay. Nice user interface. 'Kay. Right let's see it. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Alright  your favourite animal? Grizzly bear. Yeah. We're kinda losing time  though. We're losing time  but Alright. Do we have to guess? A hippo? Yeah. I don't know how to call it. A hedgehog?. Alright. Thank you. It's. Yeah sure. It's a rabbit. Well Looks very nice  right? Yes. Yes uh right. You go man. Alright. I should have made mine a white rabbit.. You're standing in front of it  I can't see it. Alright  thank you. Yeah it's a bird  but what kind of bird? You have to push harder. Release your anger. Hmm. It's a cat. It's a pig. Right. No it looks great. Just save it. Oh great. It's good for group spirit. Right. Right. I think it's im it's important to uh look at uh the remote controls of our competitors. Get the good points uh try to merge them into one universal remote control. On our corporate site I saw uh a new D_V_D_ player uh we're gonna produce. Maybe it's important to make it compatible with the D_V_D_ player so you can uh use your television and your D_V_D_ player with the same uh remote control. Furthermore it's important to make it uh acceptable for the whole world  for different cultures  maybe  because we want to we want to well fifty million? Yeah yeah so a lot of people have to be able to use it. So Yeah. Yeah that's right. Mm-hmm. Right. Maybe we could make one button to switch between D_V_D_ player and T_V_ and make the other buttons uh multi-functional or something. Yeah right. Yeah so but th that's kind kind of standard T_ television so it also works on that. Yeah but We need to to keep it consistent with other d uh Yeah but it's it has to be useable. Yeah. No.. Not with two hands. Yeah yeah yeah  right. No Yeah but it's quite important that it fits. Yeah. Yeah. It shouldn't be boxy. Nah I don't agree with the long box uh shape it it has to be custom made for the hand. Yeah. Yeah but if you shape it If No that's ol old fashioned. I can imagine that us Well Yeah right. It fits in your palms. Hmm? Um.. Well Yeah but it has it has to fit your hand. It shouldn't be too boxy  you know. It's No no no. Yeah. Yeah it should be Right maybe something like this or and then a button here to switch between different systems like D_V_D_ player and so you can I've Yeah right  and I do think we have to keep this kind of idea with the with the numbers and Right. But it should be possible to to um make it ap apparent that there are two functions for every button. So there has to be some space between the buttons. Yeah. Yeah right right  and maybe we should use colours. Yeah. That's kinda trendy. Yeah right. Right. But I think it's uh it's important to uh notate all the the decisions that we make  so we Yeah. No problem. Yeah. Yeah it shouldn't be too heavy. Yeah yeah yeah. Yeah it's univ yeah yeah yeah. Yep. And you can use Yeah. But are Are we going w uh with the front uh fronts uh idea? I think we should make it universal and you can always use a front front on it  you know? You can use it just plain but you can To make it more trendy. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah right. Yeah yeah yeah. But people of often don't like bright colours or something. We have to make it grey or s or black. Yeah but then you can use a a front. Yeah that's right. Yeah or a t Teletubby front. Yeah yeah yeah. I will investigate. Right. It's Yeah yeah yeah just if you start up your Internet Explorer Yeah. Well that's great. Thirty minutes. It's totally broken. Oh. Hi there. We want to erase it. Thanks. Big bird. Mm. Uh no I don't. It's just a bird. Here you go. Mm. Width. Hmm. It's a pussy cat. It certainly is. Easy to learn. Yeah. Yeah. I also think we should not add too many buttons. Modern day uh remotes have too much buttons I think. Precisely. Yeah. Yeah indeed. Yeah we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use  we uh we make? Yeah. And I think the people who who will buy our uh remote already have some experience with remotes. So we can keep that in mind. W well it's a n it's a new remote and you don't buy a remote if you don't have anything to uh to control with it. Yeah alright  but Yeah. Yeah we could use another form or shape or colour  that kind of things. Well we we could make more more oval or something  and and Yeah or so Well yeah it's new. but young people want something different and it is Yeah. Yeah alright. Yeah. Yeah it doesn't fit. No if y if you look at new Phillips uh D_V_D_ with their uh remotes pl players they they are the new remotes aren't box shaped. They're all um Well Yeah. Yes uh Well most of of them are are somewhat thicker at the end  and get um yeah thinner towards the uh the other end. Mm. Yeah it Yeah yea Hmm.. Yeah. Yeah maybe we can um just like on cell phones those um well you can you can put on on them  and so you can customise your uh your own remote with different colours or or special paint jobs I dunno but Well. Mm... Yeah that's bad  yeah. Yeah that's important. Yeah. But our T_V_s are mostly made in China and that sort of country  so. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Mm. Well you can make profit with them  and it's a way to make them trendy. Yeah alright. Yeah normal. No a colour everyone accepts. Mm. Mm. Yeah. standard. Well young people s li Yeah yeah  yeah. Yeah. What's the uh url or the website 'cause I didn't get Yeah. Oh oh right oh well I didn't uh use it. Yes. Next meeting is in Thirty minutes. Yeah alright it's it's handy to know Oh. Goodbye. S. Yo. Ow. Uh Yeah. What the Uh Yeah well  ja well let's just start. I've uh made a presentation uh but uh I'll open it on the Smartboard  so we can all see it. So it's in the project documents because that's what we can find here. Well. Very nice. Well this is called the the the kick-off meeting. So uh I'm the Project Manager  so I had to fill it in  and uh hmm. Oh sorry. And an uh a nice agenda. Uh we'll do the opening and then uh we'll meet each other  what uh we already do  so  that's not uh very much trouble. I'll I'll show you the the tools we have here  so that we can all use them. Then uh we'll look at the project plan from uh Real Reaction. We'll discuss about our first ideas about the project  and then uh we'll close the meeting  and then we can uh individually uh do our things and then uh we'll get back here. So this the opening we'll uh We have to uh design a new television remote control. You have heard that uh already I think  so. Um we want it to be original  so a nice uh a nice new design. Uh trendy  it's also for young people  and we have to just uh make it uh modern. And uh friendly  so size does matter. And uh Well it has to be a have the the right uh the right buttons on the right place  that kin those kind of things. Other uh There happen to be uh three stages. functional  conceptual  and d detailed design. Um so every time we we'll do some individual work  get meeting  talk about it  uh and then go into the next phase. That's just it. Um We have uh these two Smartboards. Um well as I just showed  there's a project management folder  a project document folder on the desktop. It just works exactly the same as a computer. You just uh click on the on the folder and you open the everything you you put in it with your laptop. So you can uh make uh Words Excel  everything. Um and the w the r uh the rest uh also works the same so uh when you open a notepad you uh you just get your uh things  you can uh draw. This is a uh well a drawing board. you have a these different uh functions on the board. You can see them there. So you have a a nice pen  and it's works just like a bal ball pen. This is just a. I want to uh Oh yeah. Of course w doesn't work any more. Yes I will eraser so. It's fantas fantastic. We can uh uh well you can save a file. So if uh we draw we have to save everything. Don't throw anything away. Uh just we can start a new one  and we just go on  and don't throw anything away. Just uh let them all uh stand here. We can delete  but we don't do that. Um you can here select a pen  you can draw anything you want. It's a bit uh childish you have to write. It's not as fast as you w you know it  but it does work sometimes. Well it's just like a normal uh paint. So it's gone. Well we are designers  so we have to have a a more uh a Smartboard. So that's fantastic. Um well this uh speaks for itself. We going to try it. So um we all uh are going to uh draw a nice animal on this board  not my idea. Yes our your favourite. So um I'm to going to have to draw a kangaroo  but I'm going d I'm not going to. I'm just uh going to uh well draw a nice uh beast w I dunno what I'm going to design. Oh um doesn't oh. Yeah  'kay. Hmm? I just said it's not my idea but I am the Project Manager  and officially this is my idea. So what? Ah the first the first meeting is just a bit uh loose  loosen up  a bit uh meeting each other well uh uh nice yeah. Sh I hope our Industrial Designer does this better because uh this is uh No so a a few legs. Yes yes guess. Well I should make it an hippo now. No I don't think so. Well what is it  huh? Yeah difficult English word. I didn't knew it myself. Our characteristics sum it up. Well it's uh very uh painful those kind of thing. So we can uh just uh We're going back and now uh our Industrial Designer can uh draw its uh most favourite animal. Huh. Oh uh but this uh marketing designer. what kind of animal is that then? Uh it. Yeah. No no no. What are you going to do? No no. No no save it and start a new uh save it and start a new black uh doc a blank document. Yeah well we have to save everything so now um the next one uh and then save it and start an blank document. Yeah. There's also different colours and different uh well pen widths uh the line the the thickness thickness. So um well you should uh try it but uh Well y y y you could have but uh. It speaks for itself. What the uh just a duck. Nice. Is it a duck? Is it a plane? It doesn't draw uh circles uh that easy uh. Yeah just a bit a bit childish  a bit. Well uh save the document and then uh And then a a new blank document for. uh will uh choose a new colour and a new pen width so w we can all see it. No well first yeah. And then you go to format I think  and current colour you choose a new colour. And a new pen width uh also format. It's not like in paint. Line width. And you can choose a nice one. Width width. With each other. Yeah. So. Just a wa that's the way we do it's quite easy. Mm-hmm. Oh Pussy. Well then you change it. And erase things. What? Super pig. So Yeah yeah yeah we know. Yes alright. It's a cat. Well well um Yeah save it and start a new blank document. Yep. So that's uh what we're going to use when we uh need it. Well it's terrific  eh? Yeah that's it. We're one big happy family now. Well then uh the serious uh stuff. We're we want to sell it at twenty five Euros internationally um so um but we dunno what exactly th i it is in dollars  but uh twenty five Euros. Our profit aim is  worldwide  fifty million Euros. So I didn't uh exactly uh calculate how much we have to sell. we want to keep it our costs at twelve and a half Euros so  keep uh that in mind when we uh talk about our uh materials an f and stuff  and uh marketing uh research. Now then we all uh we can uh sit down and discuss uh what do we think about our current remote controls  first about design uh about uh aim in the market etcetera? Well uh we c we can sit down uh because uh presentation can wait. We can uh take notes and uh Well who has uh some uh remarks about the current uh remote controls? Please? No uh I did. Well uh just w we're uh four uh if we if we would just have one then Yeah. Yeah yeah. Yep. That's alright. That would be a nice idea  yes. Yep yep yep. Yes fifty million is our aim to a profit  so. Yes. I'll make uh notes and then uh maybe uh well I'll put it in the project uh folder when I'm done uh just now. Well yeah? No that's right. Y y you don't use uh the half of them that's that's culture uh international. Yes. Yep  and maybe we do uh we even have uh more than just a D_V_D_ player. Don't we have uh other uh ou Uh. We also uh just uh released a T_F_T_ uh thing I saw. Yeah. Yep. Well yeah. It doesn't have to be  but we can. Well except if we deliver it together with our D_V_D_. Yeah because we look at competitors and w if we pick up the good things about that and give it a nice design Yes. Yep. Yeah. Oo N we can use uh it as a as a game pad. So one hand has the beer  so the other hand uh Well i we already uh one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy so Well there has been done a lot of researches about remotes uh we have to we can imagine uh because it's a long time uh on the market. So the the form will have been uh tested out so Yes. Well for me personally I have a a lot of remotes uh at home but those ones that have a a round ending and uh well uh just an uh square uh middle I don't like to use them. I have uh have to it has to fit my hands. When it falls over it and I just have and then the button that I use most has to be here. It f it fits your hands and then you just push the button that you use most with thumb. Tho tho those new D_V_D_ players on the market do have those. D_V_D_ players. Yes. Well A it h it has it it has a that's tha th th shape that it fits your hand. That's We have five minutes left. So Yes uh that's yep. Yep. Ha. Sound nice. Yes. Well it's just uh about our first ideas now so I think individually we'll have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera. Yes? Yes. Well thirty minutes we have. So um This is about uh what we are going to uh do uh. You'll get specific instructions when you're back in your room so uh it's uh logical uh. I think. Oh and uh that's uh that's all. So we'll just get a notice that the the meeting is uh over. Yeah yes say. Well I have had remotes that um they had uh the function of the buttons was about uh uh a layer over the buttons and when I've had use it much it was gone. So it has to be made in the buttons I think. It has to uh not be loose. Yeah. Is there an a universal uh universal way of um transmitting from the remote to the television so it's all about uh It's not that in China it's different? Yeah. But y you can have uh of course different between D_V_D_s and televisions and between Yeah. Probably yes. China rules. Well I think uh w we can look into that in the in the next uh thirty minutes. Yeah. Yes. Well j just y you get a n a normal front with it  but you can change them uh when you buy the And we should uh dispatch those kind of fronts fronts a a around the world so uh Well th those fifty million don't uh don't se sells itself so we have to uh make uh some extra effort like fronts uh. Yes. Yeah well it has to it h it has to fit the the te television and D_V_D_ set we are going to sell  so if they are uh black and black black and silver we'll make them black and silver so. Yeah. Well if if you yeah. If you have a a a television room for little children and you make a if if you buy a a pink front they'll they'll love it. I think. But that's uh marketing uh research you can uh you can ask uh. Yes. Well our user interface you can uh maybe uh I don't know what your specific instructions will be  but uh probably about uh the precision of the buttons and and those kind of things and what buttons will have to be on the uh remote. And you will look into the technical design and um form  I think. Or something like that. Yeah. Yeah. Euro? Well it it it's if you uh Finish meeting now. Oh alright. Well uh we're going to back uh back into our rooms so In thirty minutes  but uh I think it will be you will be warned uh through your laptop uh to get over here. I'll have to restore my uh my desktop uh because uh it's it's the half of the normal size. Oh right  oh. Ma W that was a nice meeting. Yeah  see you. ,The project manager opened the meeting and then the user interface designer and industrial designer presented their prototype for the remote which featured an LCD screen  a scroll button  and a battery indicator. The marketing expert conducted a project evaluation of the prototype. The team found the remote to be fancy  innovative  fairly easy to use  available in different colors  fairly spongy  difficult to misplace  and targeted to younger people. The project manager then led the team in calculating the production costs of their remote. The team had difficulty in meeting the the target cost and had to eliminate some of the more expensive components they had hoped to include in their design. The project manager then led the team in an evaluation of the project process. The team found the project stressful  the equipment useful  the information available to them lacking  and their laptops to be slow and heavy. 
Okay. No  that's okay. Joost  your mouse. No mouse needed? Mm. A touch-pad? Slap it. Is Um F_ five. F_ five. I don't. You've got your name. Hope it working. Never close your laptop. Yeah. Okay. What is your name? Antek Ahmet. And Joost. Okay. Yeah. Yes. Can we see the white-board on our laptops? No  I saw I saw the file  the smart-board that X_B_K_ but Okay. With that pen? Mm. Mm. Little bit slower. piranha. Okay. Oh. Yellow Hmm. Different. Okay. I will try. Yeah. I will try. Uh Blank? Okay. Then pen again? Okay. Okay  um control. Uh Ah  purple. Um  I don't know what my uh favourite uh animal is  but the easiest animal I can think is is a bird. Uh I will That's my bird. Yeah? Isn't it quite it's a little bit light. Uh  another colour maybe. A red one. A small one. Uh  line width. Two? Three. Oh that's okay. That's another one. Ano Uh uh it's a Yeah  it's uh the most simple uh animal I know  I think. Um  I don't know. Maybe because uh there's there's some s uh free uh maybe in the sky or something like that. Maybe a little bit. Yeah. I don't know. So more uh birds? Okay  okay  okay. M Pictionary. A cow. Okay. Yeah  it's little bit hard. Orange  of course. Uh yeah. Yeah. True. A little bit. Yeah. Don't mess with my birds  yeah. cat. Okay. Okay. Hmm. Different. Yeah. But isn't it It's only for television  I thought. Not I thought it was only for television. So so we probably don't have to have to uh have the functions for D_V_D_ player or V_C_R_. Uh  in the email. I thought it said uh Yeah  television remote control. True. Yeah. True. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. True. Oh my God. Okay. For the bear. Uh I I uh  no I think it Uh  I th I think yo we have to keep it simple  to get a whole market. It's international  so we have to use a standard. Hmm. Use friendly. Yep. Yeah. Yeah  yeah. Interface d Oh  I don't I didn't get a message. Oh  the Project Manager. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I don't think Oh I will need it. I've lost my screen. Uh Yes. I closed the No. Yes. Antek. 'Kay. I'm going to draw a cat. I don't know why  but a cat is a very uh smart animal. And you can have them at home. Which is not as the case with uh with bingwings and Ye yes  yeah. It's not very uh very good drawn  but you can see a cat from it. It's Ah  it's not scared. He's crying but Uh it's i most cats are small. You can handle them. Yes. Yes  Yes  that's uh something extras. Yeah. Only the experts. Uh  to go with to go with fashion and Team Leader. No. Oh. Hello. Dang it. Alright. What? I've got a touch-pad. Do you know how how I can wake it up? No  my laptop. You with your brilliant ideas. I don't know if I can touch the power button. Do you know how how I can wake it up? Oh. Come on  move it. Now  wake up  bitch. Yeah  so did I. I closed it. That wasn that wasn't very smart  I guess. Come on. Get back to me. Yes. I closed it. No  I didn't restart it  I just closed it. Yes. Alright. Great. Thanks. Mm-hmm. Yes. Yes. Nobody  I guess. Format. You know  I thought of that actually. Yeah. Its simplicity. Yeah  whatever. I'll go next. Thanks. I haven't got a favourite animal too  so Oh. What should I draw? Thank you  I'll draw a penguin. Yeah. I'll draw a penguin. Whatever. I can't draw  so you can start to laugh already. Whatever. Something like that. Come on. Mm hmm hmm  orange. Whatever. Oh  it's better than your bird. Everything's better than your bird. Whatever. Hey  it's blue. No. Whatever. Um  I like its ugliness and uh Yeah  whatever. The way it walks or whatever. Your turn. Drawing. Or a line. I mean a bird. Hmm. It's a handicapped cat. He's crying because it's ugl because of his ugliness. I wouldn't call it training  but Alright. I don't th I don't think the four of us got problems with remote controls  but if you see elderly people  all these buttons  and then they buy new T_V_ because their previous one was stolen or whatever. And then a totally different remote control with with different functions on different places  and half of the functions a are removed  or whatever. Uh  so I think what we need is is a clear uh remote control with uh grouped buttons  you know. All th all the buttons which apply to the text functions in in one uh Well  one area or whatever  not like the button to enter text on top of the remote control and the button to um  yeah  to minimise it to this this or whatever o o other functions totally somewhere else. I think we should group them. And same for the for the volume buttons and the the t Well I was I was thinking uh since a T_V_ is uh mostly used together with a V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player or recorder  and not with a stereo  I think it should be good to include functions for V_C_R_s and D_V_D_ players  recorders. Yeah. I don't know. Hi-fi set is uh not often used uh as I know of in combination with television. Yes. Yes  it is only for television  but uh Well well we we're gonna brainstorm about that. If we think it's useful  we do it. That's right. It's a television remote control. But I was thinking since it is useful with D_V_D_ Yep. Yeah  also no one's gonna buy it. I guess. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  way too high. Yep. Well that's an idea of course  yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yes  what the market wishes. Yeah. You just got a message. And it said uh five minutes  so we got four and a half. No. He's the whatever. Team Leader. He is the whatever. Yes. Project joc project documents is for showing uh on the white-board. Yeah. Yes. Alright. Okay. Yeah. No. I don't think so. Yes? Great. Yeah. Good luck. I will need it. And then you have to place your laptop exactly on the marked spot. It's important to place your laptop exactly on the marked spot over here. No. Yeah. Try the power button. Huh. Yeah  my name is name. Yeah? Everybody's ready? Great. Well  welcome to the kick-off meeting. I uh forgot to put my name over here  it's uh it's Martin. Uh  so you all know. Well  this is the agenda for today. Well  the opening is what I'm doing right now. Uh  we gonna do some acquaintance acquaintance things. Uh give some um examples of the tool training  project plan discussion and the closing. We have twenty five minutes. Okay  the project aim is to design a new remote control. Uh  some of the oje objectives are that is has to be original  trendy  and user-friendly. So now we all know what our goal is. Um  I oh forget I forget the whole acquaintance part  but we we all know each other. We all know each other's names. Joost  Guido  Antek. Okay. I think we uh al already uh been through that part. Okay  it consists of uh three levels of design. Uh we begin with the functional design  then we go to the conceptual design and the detailed design. Every uh level of design consists of some individual work  and we uh close it with a meeting. You all received an email with a example of our explanation of what uh the particular level of design uh means to the different uh functions  and uh you p you probably read that already  so I don't have to tell you about that. Okay  first we're gonna um uh gonna try some different things with the tools we have over here  so you get acquainted with these uh um uh meeting tools. We have the smart-boards  uh the thes those two boards. This is the presentation boards  wh which one I'm using right now. You can uh um there's a document folder called um the sh shared document folder. You can upload your uh documents to that folder and then you can open them over here  so you can do your PowerPoint presentations on this screen. We also have the white-board. Uh  we're gonna skip through th No  no. Just on the on the screen over there. Oh  no. Probably is  but I don't know if the software is on the laptop. Is is if it's mainly a thing for in the meeting  so I don't think it's I don't know if it's important. This an explanation of the smart-boards. There is a tool-bar over here. It's quite simple. You have the the pen function  eraser function. It's like a very simple uh paint application. Uh  we well  we use the same file during uh the whole day  and uh you can make new sheets by uh by pu puttin pressing on the blank button. It works like this. Oh. If pen is selected  yes. Oh  no no. It's not But it is pen. It's not working like a pen yet. Huh. Huh. It's doing some stuff now. So you can use a pen. You can use an eraser. And you can make new uh fi uh new blanks  and you can change uh the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing on forward  which y you have to select pen format. And then select current colour or line width. So  it's quite easy. Uh well  now you're all uh acquainted with the different tools. Right  we're gonna try out the electronic white-boards. Uh  every participant should draw his favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics  on blank sheets with different colours  with different pen widths. Uh  I'll start off then. I'll use this uh same sheet. Alright. Oh  let me think. Different colours. Oh. Well  I'm gonna draw um a p piranha. Uh  a fish. Uh. Mm-hmm. I'm gonna use some different colour now. Some a little white. Looks like a fish. Think it is. Oh. Oh. Uh  colour. This is black? I think so. Oh. Oh  this is just uh useless uh drawings but Oh teeth. I need teeth. Well  they're not supposed to be green  or whatever colour this is. Okay. What was uh I have su to sum up its favourite characteris Well  I like its uh sharp razor sharp teeth. Plus  uh the the big uh forehead and uh a small uh  well a small actual face. And I like its overall uh aggressive look and Well  that's what I like about uh piranha. I think that's kind of what uh the intention should be. Well  who wants to be next? You go  Guido? Okay. Uh  make a new sheet. Uh  it's by pressing on blank. Yep. Yep. And uh so in the format menu you can choose the different uh colours and uh pen widths. Well  tell us something about uh your favourite characteristics of these uh particular birds. Oh  okay. Okay. Okay. No  uh it's clear. N no no. We get your point. Okay. Who wants to be next? Oh. I'll do so. Okay. Well  you can have a piranha at home. Huh. I don't think uh I don't think uh Darwin would agree with that.. Okay. What do you like about it then? Oh  okay. Okay. Okay. Okay  and then we are uh through the tool training  I guess. Okay  this is uh something about the project finance. The selling price of our remote control is gonna be twenty five Euros. And our profit aim is fifteen million Euros. We're very ambitious on this one. The market range is international  so it's gonna be sold world-wide  and the production cost should be a maximum of twelve Euro fifty per remote control. So that's clear. Yeah? Okay  we're now gonna discuss some stuff when well  we're gonna brainstorm about uh what kind of kemoro romo remote control it's gonna be. Uh  well tell me about your experiences with the remote controls. Do you have uh know what good experiences with remote controls? Or do they annoy you sometimes? Are they difficult to understand  or maybe they don't interact with different kind of uh equipment very well? Yeah  okay. Okay. Different functions of of uh Okay. Yeah. Okay. And uh  is it gonna be a remote control that's um what it can be used for different kind of equipment  like your T_V_ and your home stereo? Uh Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But uh  the D_V_D_ players and home cinema sets often double as stereo hi-fi sets probably. It's what  from my experience. Okay. But we gonna Oh  it is only for televis So wha what What wha what uh what document But  where where did it uh Where did you find that? Oh  okay. Yeah  but most television remote controls support other functions as well. So we can No  we have to think about that. Okay  uh but uh we've gonna put some a uh is is it so user-friendliness  is a is a pri priority in this case  or Okay. Well  this the maybe is uh some aspect of the uh  or or some point at at which we can excel by making it very useful. That w Well  then you're you're the usability uh man  so this uh gonna be a very important task for you then. Okay. Well  other ideas? How can we make it trendy or something? Do uh by just sh shape and the look of it? Maybe a can opener underneath it? I don't know. Or someth something special  like uh M_P_ three player inside of it  or uh Oh  well then the production costs are gonna be too high probably. Okay. Maybe with different type of fronts or uh Well  m has to be something spectacular or uh one which makes it We gonna skip back to the goals probably. Uh  original  trendly  and user-friendly Well  we al also already talked about user-friendliness. No  well something trendy and original  well that that goes hand in hand I guess. When something is original  it tends to be trendy  probably  or we should make it combination of that. 'Kay  so you the um technical part of the process is something you're gonna look after for  so you have to think about what kind of uh equipment you want to uh  you know  you want to manage with it. Well  and that's an important part for you then  with gogors regards to the user-friendly part of it. Well  and you uh should look out for what makes it trendy. Well  you know  y like some special feature. Or some Does it does it gets some gadgetness or something. Okay. Well  the closing. Next meeting starts in thirty minutes. Individual  I think so. The the Industrial Designer will w or the working design  of course  we will uh Already s said that. The User Interface Designer is it a User Inter User Interface the technical functions design. And the Management Expert of uh the Marketing Expert. User requirements specifi Well  this one was already clear to us. Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach. I don't know how much time we have left. Oh  not many I guess. We started at twelve. Oh  and what does it said? W Okay  well um No  we're uh ahead of schedule then. Yeah  close it. I'm gonna make some minutes or take some minutes. And uh it's it's clear you can put the stuff in the project documents presentations. You can all Or we're all uh Yeah. Yeah  but we're all familiar with uh uh Microsoft PowerPoint  are we? Yeah  okay. I'm gonna wri uh write some stuff down and then we're ready. Or we can leave already I guess. or uh or sh or should we uh or is important that we leave at exact uh Okay. Yes. We'll see each other in uh thirty minutes. Yeah  good luck. ,The project manager opened the meeting and then the marketing expert discussed user requirements. The marketing expert also found that younger users want an LCD display and a remote capable of speech recognition. The interface specialist discussed the interior workings of a remote and stated a preference for using radio waves over infra-red technology. The industrial designer discussed particular components that a remote could include. The project manager briefed the team on some new requirements and initiated a discussion in which the team discussed and decided on various features to include in the remote they will produce. 
Um minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we uh had decided on roles for each of you  however  um there are some changes that I've got from on high that um are a bit uh well w what I didn't actually realise it was that the uh this is for a specific television. So the all in one idea goes out the window. And they require that the uh actually I'll get to that at the end point number four  um we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it. So um  presentations  were you anybody got  raring to go? Raring to go? Okay. Good stuff. Mm. Oh I need to plug you in. Just about. Uh there we go  just screw 'em on in. Gonna have to swap them round so now  it was function F_ eight. That's the wee blue one. Blue one F_ eight. Should do it  good one. Hold on  sorry. and if you just click that it'll go ahead  one at a time. Sorry  uh. P press F_ five to start it first. Jesus. Excellent. Oh you wanna go back? Just escape. Okay. Okay. Okay. Speech recognition. Hmm. We're als we we're looking at who buys it as well. Uh  which I think the twenty five to thirty five is uh usual  sort of. Fifteen to twe Okay. Okay  thank you. Um  follow on with Helen? Yeah please. Oh  so we do yeah. Fun and games. Don't know if the cable's gonna be long enough. I think I just kicked over whatever it runs on underneath as well. Okay. Function F_ eight. Hmm. There you go. Uh F_ five. Um  F_ five and escape'll bring it back and just uh the left button for advancing. Uh just a left uh left mouse button. Mm-hmm. Okay. 'Kay. That can come under Arlo as well. Uh. Uh if you if you escape then you can see your bar. Uh okay. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. We hope so. Yeah  particularly if we've uh there was a bit in Raj's about R_S_I_ and things as well. Organic. Mm-hmm. Sales . Okay. Yeah it's like a  yeah. It's. Right. And also the company want to keep it stuck to the T_V_ for uh to keep down the production time. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. That's cool. Um  do you have trouble whistling? Really? Ooh. Yeah  I suppose that's true. Well I suppo uh you could y you could have the you could have the basically um instead of a whistle if it's got the voice recognition you could have it just  you know  where are you?. Hmm. Sounds good. Function F_ eight for the um the uh Yeah. Alright. Let's remember that. Mm-hmm. But sure surely that would have to be um sort of specific rather than above a threshold 'cause if you had a loud movie on you're likely to get it beeping back at you. Sorry I didn't mean to derail you there. Ah is that what that is? Well that's cool. If you if you can build space craft you'll have no problem with a remote control  yeah. Right okay. Is that just switches on the speech recognition and it's entirely speech operated  is it? Yeah. Yeah. Ah now it's fif fifty million Euros we've gotta uh we've g gotta make profit  so we're making that at twelve and a half Euros a time. Okay. Would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea? Is that is that gonna mark up a lot? Yeah. Yeah  yeah. I mean if you think about these base stations now it's essentially just a a lead with a sort of self connecting brake in it  so I don't think it'd up up the price that much. Okay. Okay. Right. Yeah. 'Kay  thank you very much  um I'll take that back. Right  also so um a notice I got not very long before the meeting  so didn't manage to forward it on to you  it is let's see  I'll find it myself  um Ta nah. We had that um to dis-include teletext um because it's become outdated  and everybody uses the internet anyway. Um  dunno what Oracle would have to say with that but never mind. Um it's only for the television  which I'm presuming means it's for a specific television  and um instead of colours and sorta colour options  they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design. Yellow. I presume. Um  everything  all their sort of uh you know the uh corporate website and everything's yellow. And the logo uh the sort of slogan we put the fa fashion in electronics uh I don't know exactly how sort of incorpor I mean  I guess if you're going for a sort of globular shape you could kind of have it working its way round it or something. Uh  where am I? Okay  so  we have to decide on which functions we're going to actually have. Uh  now  we had as listed options we had speech recognition potentially  flat screen interface  L_C_D_ interface um we also want to limit the number of buttons so we'll pretty much take that one as read. We'll use the the basic functions for a television. No teletext. Um okay hold on. Not enough buttons you mean? So sorta strike a balance between a a few and a or it looks like we're just cutting on the um I do however have this from over my head  that they don't want teletext on it. Uh maybe Raj you could find out what people would think about that  or maybe they'll send some information about that  about um what people  whether people would require um teletext in a remote teletext option in a remote control. Okay um. So uh I take it your position Arlo is that the bells and whistles we've gotta come up with the a gimmick but not too complicated a gimmick. Um so I mean a a the sort of inkling I'm getting from little bits of um web chatter that I'm getting sent is that they're quite interested in a T_F_T_ display  interactive display. However that does sound a bit like the more complicated design that rav uh sorry Raj um said people didn't like. Although I guess if there's a sort of If you think about standard interfaces that people use already  sort of Windows-style drop down menus or whatever  I think maybe that's a bit  going a bit far but you know like in a basic sense that you could have your basic selection of buttons  and if you hit a sort of menu at the top you have um it goes to a different selection of buttons  so it sorta keeps it simple. Um glow in the dark  is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material? Okay. So Yeah. Yeah. Lost  yeah. That's cool. That's cool. Okay  cool. Um speech recognition I take it I don't  I've I know of no products um that use speech recognition well. Really? Mm-hmm. Yeah  or a yeah an advert an advert for B_B_C_ two on B_B_C_ one'll switch the channel for you kinda thing. Mm. Uh-huh. Ah  that's a good idea. So like a kind of backwards remote from the telly. Right. That we should just stick on  yeah. Yeah. And that's a sort of basic R_F_ kind of frequency so it'll be cheap. Uh-huh. Yeah. It might do us out of a job. Um Okay. I like the whole sort of remote feedback thing. Um so I think rather than and that also kind of takes out the speech recognition in terms of the interference of it not working very well and things like that  so I th yeah and expense and the time. So I think if we're going to go well I mean like the thing about the there's the problem with the T_F_T_ or the L_C_D_ kind of thing is if you're also wanting the the kind of uh organic globby sort of feeling to it then you might have trouble incorporating the screen. Um  but I guess not I thin we'll just we'll just pretend that's not a problem. Um uh and how are you about the glow in the dark material? Is that Contrast contra well. Yeah  okay. So if it's dow it's d uh yeah. Or if it's down under the couch cushions um which is where I usually find mine. Um Okay  well we can use we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially  um if we're gonna have to if we're gonna have the logo on as well  bright yellow logo in our our um slogan. Uh then you know they're gonna be fairly brightly coloured anyway  and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well  of the glow in the dark material  just as gimmickyness. Mm-hmm. Alright  so n sorta if if if we're gon if we're gonna go with the idea of um uh of feedback  sort of remote finder  then that kinda stuffs that one out then. Do you think? Uh it makes it fairly unnecessary then. Okay. Um  okay so scratch that. Uh so we've got do we want to go with the T_F_T_ idea or the is that far too expensive? Well I mean I think I think the sort of find the finder things I mean it's uh I could probably write the circuit diagram for that myself. Um Mm-hmm. Okay. Um no  I mean that was going on ravs uh Raj's sort of um marketing research I guess. Um Uh So we'll stick with sort of programmability um for the buttons that we do have. Um. So that's sort of included in your sub-module kind of stuff  um Uh you were finding out about teletext. If you could find out that uh Um I think we're gonna scratch the speech recognition as a bit of a um expensive  no? Oh right  okay. Is it not the circuits that cost Oh right  okay. Uh well that kind of takes back the R_F_ the R_F_ remote sort of idea as well. Um. Five minutes. Okay. Decisions. Uh  votes  let's vote. Who wants T_F_T_? No-one does. Excellent  so we'll go with speech recognition  yeah? Um  speech recognition  limited buttons  organic design. And what else was I thinking of that I haven't written down and therefore fallen out my head  programmability. Uh Uh o okay. And also  integrating the  remember to integrate the logo and the s slogan. Okay  so. Um can you put all these reports in the project documents folder if they're not already in there as well. So  it just helps me summarize them. And um I'll put any I'm I'm putting anything I do in there anyway  so uh Uh pro uh project documents. On A_M_I_ scenario controller. Where am I? Project documents  yeah  it's on your desktop as well. And I will tr getting strings of um information  I'll try and forward any specific to anybody in particular  as soon as I get them now  rather than I was about to sort of tell you about the changes before the meeting  and then the meeting turned up  so I did. So Okay. Yeah. More sort of um flesh-like than plasticky sort of. Oh no  ethics  that's gonna cost us money. Okay  safety. Yeah. It sme smells good for children. That sounds  yeah it's gonna have to be it's gonna be have a big yellow foam ball  yeah  sorry. Please God no. Um. Well  I wouldn't th I mean  my reaction to an all-yellow remote control wouldn't be anything other than horror  so I think just having it surrounding the logo. Yeah. And I'll see if I can argue with boss about putting the what was it? We put we put fashion into Whoops  it's not working. Can't believe I've forgotten it. We put the fashion in electronics. I bet that'll catch on well. Okay  any last worries  queries? Okay. S s I know what you're thinking. Okay then  lunchtime  yay. Okay  that felt a bit more like a something with order and and reason to it than the last one. This is quite fun actually. I really don't Yeah  yeah. Wow you've your first page. I was just writing really big. I've finished the meeting now. Oh  everybody needs k questionnaire. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Wow. So  sorry I was just gonna say  what was the question for this? Or is are you coming on to that? Okay. So these percentages are are what? Hmm. Mm  mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yep  sure  that's cool  um Yeah. I can turn my computer quickly if that's okay. Um  yep. Okay  and then what do I press  F_ eight? Oh right. Okay  cool. Oh. Yeah. No signal. Okay. Cool. Okay and then how do I press the the big one  to get it on to the big F_ five and I press that again to get it off as well do I? Okay  so um I'm the interface design designer  User Interface Designer sorry  uh I'm concerned with um w what effect the apparatus should have on the user and um I'm I'm also I want to point out that our motto  put the fashion in electronics  so obviously we as a company we want to make our products trendy and fashionable  it's a big concern of ours. Okay  and how do I press n just the next button? The arrow? Okay. So um I looked at existing designs and also um the information that Raj gave us was very useful about what people like  what people dislike. Um and what people fashionable  because we said people between twenty five and thirty five were the main um buyers of of our T_V_ I think. So um what they like and what they find fashionable. And ergonomics  we said um  I don't know I haven't actually been able to do any of this myself  but um maybe that comes up  I don't know. And the findings  well the basic that was the basic function to send messages to the television set. That's what people want to do. Um  so they need to be included  um  but I've got some pictures here of some leading ones. I don't know how to get to them  do I press F_ five is it? escape? Oh okay  cool. I haven't got my glasses on so I hope it's this one. These are two leading um remote controls at the moment. You know they're grey  they've I mean this one's got loads of buttons  it's hard to tell from here what they actually do  and they don't look very exciting at all. Um  personally I prefer this one just because it's looks easier use  it's a bit more sleek with more of this silver stuff  um  but there you go  that's what we're up against  and I think we can do much better than that. Um hang on. F_ five  okay  sorry. Personal preferences. Um  well I think we need to l I think the ergonomics is quite um important  um Uh-huh. And um I thought not too edgy and like a box  more kind of hand-held more um not as uh computery and or organic  yeah  more organic shape I think. Um simple designs  like the last one we just saw  not too many buttons and as Raj pointed out  only ten percent fifty percent of people only use ten percent of the buttons  so I think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and and how nice it looks. Um  hand-held and portable I think is portamint is important because T_F_T_ have just um released um I think is it a a remote control for presentations or uh and a big seven inch big screen  anyway  so um Yeah  no seven inches isn't that big but um anyway um so hand-held and portable and uh m I thought about other functions for T_V_ but as you pointed out people don't actually want that  so maybe we forget about that. It's for one T_V_ oh right okay  sure. And so the last thing I thought w which I quickly mentioned in the other one was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people  like glow-in-the-dark um which does already e exist but it's not very widely used I don't think. Easy finder with the a whistle function or something  or rechargeable station because it's a pain when you run out of batteries. And I think that  yep  that's it. Okay? Mm-hmm. Um  I haven't been able to Mm-hmm  yeah or some sort of voice Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah  something. Oh you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah sure. Well I like that design. Yeah  not a problem. Mm-hmm. Or a little base station or something . That might cost more though  'cause obviously with batteries we don't need to provide  well we provide the first batteries  but it's more  it's that's cheaper to just provide batteries. A battery in it  kinda. Okay. Okay. Mm. Mm that's a good idea actually I like the programmable options. Mm 'kay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Corporate colour. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Although the the danger with that is  it could look a bit cheap. Yeah. Well Mm. On the number of buttons  kind of functions and stuff. Mm-hmm  okay. Okay  cool. Mm-hmm  mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Um Glow in the dark material I was thinking. Um  so I I guess that would be cheaper than a light I think. Often lost s was that  yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm  mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. Well what about this might get a bit too expensive actually  but what about um something that's built into the T_V_ um that you can press and it'll send out a little signal you know like the ones that we can't hear or something um that that will activate the remote control starts to beep. If you find if y Yeah. Mm. Yeah  that's the only thing  yeah. That comes with our remote control. Yeah. Mm-hmm. That could also be built into the T_V_ though  which might make our remote control a bit obsolete. Yeah  okay. Mm. And the expense. Mm-hmm. Mm. Maybe not even all of it 'cause we said um colours and fashion w were important so maybe um just like a little l line that's kind of around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah  'cause what I thought  main Slogan  yeah. Right. Mm-hmm. 'Cause yeah  that w more than finding it  that was more like you know if you're watching a film in the dark  you can um still see the remote control. That was more of a a gimmick. Mm. Yeah  unnecessary. Yeah. Mm. So is that one of our definite requirements that they wa that it needs a T_F_T_ screen? Yeah you think so? Okay. Mm-hmm  that's cool. Um if it's not too expensive s I think it's a good gimmick. Mm-hmm. And where is it sorry? Oh. Okay  cool. Okay. Okay. What I thought as well about the material is um maybe not this kind of material  but maybe more like um this kind of rubbery material  it's a bit more bouncy  like you said they get chucked around a lot. Um  a bit more durable and that can also be ergonomic and it kind of feels a bit different from all the other remote controls. The rubber rather than Mm-hmm  mm-hmm. Oh I think wi with the more organic shape of it it won't be as it won't as have many sharp corners as that  so that's something good  um I dunno  I mean That's a good idea. Interesting. Yeah  d with the colour  um does it have to be all yellow  do you know? No. Yeah. Having a little bit. Okay cool. Mm mm. Mm-hmm  okay. Cool. Oh yeah  that's a good one that. Yeah so. Wow. Has anybo oh. Has anybody pressed okay  it vibrates. It's pretty cool. Yeah  got small writing. I don't wanna waste it. Yeah. Yeah. Um. So how S Sh do you want me to hold it? So  after that? F_ eight. f oh sorry F_ eight. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Uh  me again  Rajan the Marketing Expert. Uh  as we have decided in the last meeting that I have to find out  sorry  yeah sure. Yeah  yeah. Uh actually  sorry I have to see the other  sorry. Yeah  thank you. Uh  yes  I have to look at the uh market potential for this product  uh  like consumer likings and everything  what is the potential for this product and are we able to achieve our a net profit or our aims or not? Then Sorry. Okay. Yeah  I can  okay. Uh then uh the methodology I adopted to find out all this was market survey. A a detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their likings and dislikings  what they prefer what they not prefer  w what problems they do encounter in all this type of things. And what we got was  we found that if you uh  what they th what problems they are having with different uh remote controls available in the market. Seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly. They are not so good looking. So  we have to put stress on this  uh we have to take care of this fact also like our design  uh should be appropriate  should be good looking for the consumers. And yes that's wi uh this will definitely  this can definitely put uh uh enhance our sales. Uh and even uh the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high uh pay more for this uh good looking remote controls also. So even if the available market goes for the available uh even if the market goes for the available remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five Euros  which maybe which may seem quite high but if our looks are are if the re remote control we design have a good better uh better look uh designs  then we can hope that consumers will prefer these g remote controls. Then And the second thing  some some companies they think that they should have more and more functions of the users uh or in their remote controls  but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want  what they operate  rather than making it too complicated. Because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons  so there is no point of having ninety percent buttons making the remote controls too bulky  too complicated too expensive a because I think I believe that technology is useful only if uh the consumers they want to use it. Otherwise there is no point of having all this type of things. So this will not only reduce the cost of our remote controls but it will increase our profit also. So we have to take care of this fact also. Then. Uh it was function I want to go to. Uh  escape  okay thank you. Then if we look at this slide  uh these are in your shared documents  you can see  like Uh  sorry. Ah t look all the market potential  what uh how we should design consu our remote controls  what they should be there so as to en enhance our profit  enhance our sales. Yeah  these are different age group persons like uh sorry  I can open it in another way. Uh  yes. If we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to uh pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not  we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this uh this uh point  like for speech recognition in a remote control. So we can emphasise on this point also like  because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from uh fifteen to thirty five  and I uh and I think that most of the users of the rem uh T_V_ are belong to this age group. So we should look Yeah. We can look at that that factor also  so yes. Yeah. So  and And then Yes. I think so. Uh if we look at this data how how uh h how what are the problems the consumers are facing with the existing remote controls in the market. They find that thirt uh thirty five percent uh thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control. So it should be in such a way that it should be easy to learn how to operate these remote controls and we should provide pl uh spe uh proper manuals for its use also so as that people consumers could easily learn. They need not to have any  much technical knowledge to see uh to know how to operate these remote controls. So this is also a very goo uh major factor to loo uh take into consideration to enhance our profits and sales. So um this is all about uh market potential by me. Uh  yes  th thank you. Yeah we have to take that out. Sorry. Sorry. Uh sorry  I have. Brian  this one also I. Yeah. Thank you very much Brian. If you want me to help  yeah. Yeah. Uh F_ eight. Function F_ eight. Mm s. It's not coming. Function F_ eight  okay. Yeah. Computer. Computer adjusting  yeah. Yeah. Escape. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Fifty million was uh prof As a profit. Yeah  me too. Yeah. About cost. Okay. Uh. I Uh may I say something about? Uh actually I think it's really really very important point uh as if we look at the market because people mor fifty percent people they find that the remote controls are often lost somewhere in the remote  in the room. But yeah are lost and means they forget where they have kept the remote control last time. But if we add speech recognition as well as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control  like if they come and speak something at the remote control uh replies to something something and it glows in the dark. Both these factors uh both these points will help them to locate the where they have kept this remote control  and this will definitely enhance our uh market sales  so we should take it into consideration also. Yeah. Totally  it takes cheap speech recognition  she they wi Yeah. Glow in dark. Here? Sure. Uh it is in shared documents? Projoct uh projector. Hmm. It is not giving anything. Shared documents. Um but we have to take care like But we have to take care of our children also if they means if children catch hold of your or if they chew it it shouldn't be too harmful. So  whatever material we use it should be yeah. So we have to safety point of view also  we have to take care. Yeah. Small logo with the like a small yellow strip or y yellow with the logo in it. Yeah. Hmm. That's good. Check here. It's a inspired design. Hmm. Of course. So uh  I noticed your talk about speech recognition and whistling  and uh I was just curious to know  have we done any research into how many people can whistle? Um  or if is that a function we want in the remote? I don't  but I I know a lot of people do right. Yeah it just I mean it has to be a certain kind of whistle too  right? That's costly though. Um a much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping um  shouting  you know  uh and then  what would the response be? It beeps back at you or something? Okay. Well  uh let me set this up. So I plug it in  press F_ five? Function F_ five? Or function F_ eight? Okay. Okay. I think it's uh just to lock it in. It's got it. Okay. Um. So as the Industrial Designer my job is to take an input from you guys  um so it's good you went first  and I jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and uh what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others. Um so Raj told us that uh consumers are willing to spend more for fancy products  and um he also mentioned that uh the current products don't always match users' operating behaviour. Um  a lot of the buttons aren't used  and uh he mentioned that they're not fun to use. And uh a novel feature which uh we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote  there could be a little microphone on it  and any noise over a certain threshold um it'll pick up as a a distress signal um from you and it'll beep back and say you know oh here I am or something of this sort. Oh yeah  yeah  that's true. Well maybe you could have a um hmm tha that would be a consideration to take into account yes. Um. Yeah well tha that's uh for later down the road um  and then as for the user interface it should be trendy  um and not computery  right  so more low tech and not too many buttons. So I took these all into consideration and also I have some limitations from the boss. Right um  and practical limitations which I kinda threw out the window. And so I did a little research and unfortunately all I had to work on was our uh our corporate archives of the great products we've made before  which include  you know  um space craft  coffee makers  and bullet trains Or uh or a high speed train. Right and having personally worked with all these products uh I have a great deal of experience with uh with industrial design of these. Right. So  I figured  just put 'em all together. You got a a caffeine powered space shuttle train transport to your T_V_  and um as for the user interface problem  you know  too many buttons. Give it one button and and it's a you know  for the the cowboy in all of us I I'm not quite sure what the the function is there but Yeah it's a g I mean you could have a you know a Right. So I think I I missed the budget thing  it was fifty million Euros? And we gotta sell twenty five of them? Right. Okay. Oh okay  so I I mixed those numbers. Okay. Well I guess more realistically then  we need a product that's got some kinda nifty outer casing  cheap plastic uh  you know  um that should be just like uh a tenth of the price maybe or less. An energy source which'd probably just be uh your regular batteries um  we don't wanna have it Uh. Yeah  yeah  we could do that too. Um  I hadn't thought of that. Yeah. Right. Right  so so the unirs the user interface uh the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons  but since we're a cutting edge company  we uh of course will have alternatives like uh speech recognition  whistling recognition and rocket power behind our product. Um and lastly the transmission interface is uh  just some engineering thing you don't have to worry about. Um so here's you know  a great schematic that my uh apprentice designer gave me. Um as you can see the the remote control have parts and those parts look like that and um you know it's got a little operating procedure that looks something like that. And I suppose you all know how it works because we've all used it and we wouldn't be in a company designing remote controls if we didn't know what they were so uh personal preferences  I think uh programmable options which um just require a small amount of memory  uh non volatile memory  just um so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it's not blasting. Oh okay. And the uh  the bells and whistles that we mentioned you know  they take more budgeting  um more technical uh expenditure of effort and it's also much more likely to not work if if we add these bells and whistles. That's all I got. Ooh that's tight. Okay  I don't think we need to screw it in. Just push it. Yellow. Yeah yeah. Well hmm. Oh it's They're act there there was a remote control that came out two years ago that had a some basic speech recognition on it. You could programme it with your channels and then you say you know like uh B_B_C_ one and it goes to that channel. Yeah  it didn't work very well though because of this noise interference problem. They mentioned you know if the television says you are listening to B_B_C_ one. Right  right  and so there was a lot of this  you'd be watching the T_V_ and then all of a sudden it'd it'd pick up a noise and turn it off or you know or turn the volume off or something  but if you can work around that that noise problem Right. Right and then it would do just you know  uh subtractive kind of cancellation of the noise. What you could do then would be you have uh a remote controlled by the T_V_ speaker  or not a remo I'm sorry  a microphone by the T_V_ speaker and a transmitter there that sends back to your remote  'cause you can't um expect uh the the television manufacturers to to put that feature into their T_V_s. But yeah  then you have like the little se separate module by the T_V_ speaker which Right  and then the remote control would know um what's being produced by the television. Right  right. Right  right. Um. Yeah that's certainly possible then an another thing was about this losing the remote and trying to find it again. If you do have this sorta speech interface to it  you don't even need to find it. You just say you know  um whatever you whatever you want the remote for  you know to change the channel or to uh turn the T_V_ on and off  you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it's within you know  within hearing range. And uh you know it could be somewhere in the room y that you've no idea where it is and it would still do its job. Well  hopefully we're uh we're ahead of the curve. Hmm. Um. Mm. Yeah  no th the material's cheap but it's just uh the the glow in the dark material needs some light to charge it you know  and then uh if you're  if you're sitting in the dark for too long it uh it won't glow any more. Right. Right. Mm-hmm. Um yeah we're getting a lot of features now  I I think Yeah. Well  I think a consideration too is that these uh remotes get abused a lot  you know they get thrown around  there's a good chance the the T_F_T_ screen would break or uh get damaged. They're pretty fragile. Yeah mm. Oh. Oh no it's it's much cheaper than the T_F_T_  it's just a microphone and some some integrated circuits. And it'd it'd be a small vocabulary speech recognition system  like a Okay. Yeah. Yeah yeah. So it should be when you save on your desktop  so it goes save as  or And then uh hit that little folder up thing again. Again. All the way to the top  yeah that's up to desktop. Right and then project documents. Mm. Did you get my email? Okay. Just making sure. Yeah. Wow. We could go comp yeah. We could go completely out of the box and make the thing a big red ball foam ball. And it's got the thing on the inside. And there's no buttons at all  it's always on  and just yell at it  and it works. And then ch children will love it. Oh yellow  yellow ball. Right. Twelve thirty. Mm. Yep. Yeah I've been using up the pages. Another questionnaire. ,The Industrial Designer gave his presentation on the basic functions of the remote. He presented the basic components that remotes share and suggested that smaller batteries be considered in the product design. The User Interface Designer presented his ideas for making the remote easy-to-use; he discussed using a simple design and hiding complicated features from the main interface. The Marketing Expert presented the findings from a lab study on user requirements for a remote control device  and discussed users' demand for a simple interface and advanced technology. The Project Manager presented the new requirements that the remote not include a teletext function  that it be used only to control television  and that it include the company image in its design. The group narrowed down their target marketing group to the youth market. They discussed the functions the remote will have  including Video Plus capability and rechargeable batteries. A customer service plan was suggested to make the remote seem more user-friendly  but it was decided that helpful manuals were more within the budget. The group then discussed the shell-like shape of the remote and including several different casing options to buyers. 
Why are you looking at me? Do I have a choice? Okay. Ooh ooh  things falling everywhere. Right  okay. Cool. Okay. So  my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey so um Okay. Oh  good point. Ah  the eyes always ruin it. Right. Okay  what do it's eyes like? Okay  cool. Um this is a rabbit. Yeah  I don't think it's furry enough  so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit. Okay  right  it's a fluffy rabbit  blue. Rabbits don't come in blue but you know. Um okay and I like it because it's small and it's fluffy. And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink. Okay? I am the um I need my notebook  mm ooh top banana. Thank you. Okay  cool  I am the Marketing Expert um so like I'm gonna be doing the apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user g requirements specification of the functional design  um trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design um so yeah. Um I'm from Leicester  um second year. Um what else do you want to know? I like sports um yeah  aerobics  kickboxing  spinning um and uh not with rabbits  no no. And vets  I like vets as well. And yeah um and I like cocktails  especially pink ones. Okay? Cool. Is a bit more impressive than my rabbit. I think it needs four legs if it's gonna walk though. They're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs and then just some horns. It looks like Eeyore. Horns  draw some horns. Is that a lizard? Is there a difference? If you right click on it you can Yeah  I was looking at the website  and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures. So the motto is um we put the fashion in electronics and um so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional  you know? So I'm kind of thinking  you know like those phones that they have  the new generation ones  where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that. You know  so something heading towards that  so it's not overly I mean I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls  so I figure how many do you need  you know? Okay. Something that's a little less crowded than this  like I mean you know  theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_  right? But what do most people do? They turn it on  they watch certain specified channels  you know  and then they turn it off again. Sometimes they play a movie. Yeah  so there's no need to have buttons on it to do that  maybe to do Yeah. So  if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works  then you know that's fine and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons  which just confuse them. Hmm. 'Cause like if you look at the train  it's just very like  there's no extra bits on it  the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing um but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people  but it looks really pretty too. Mm-hmm. ... Mm  yeah. I didn't receive it yet. Not at this point. Yeah well origi uh at first I thought it was going to be cat. Yeah now I now I understand now  yeah. Yeah. Ah. Okay. Um so my name is Maarika. Where's the pen? Okay. Yeah  well  or I can make it smaller. Uh so um um I'm the Interface Designer in this project and my favourite animal  I m I mean I'm not so sure because I'm not so so very um familiar with all kinds of animals  but I do like dogs. Oh  sorry  maybe I should have shouldn't have said it beforehand but mm hmm. Um well  there are different kinds of dogs  but okay um. Okay. Yeah  maybe it has some colourful patches  yeah. Um yeah and I do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal. Mm  well that's compared to some other animals like cats. Um they're really much more fun because they are not so independent. Um yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well  yeah. Um what it has to do with with my role in the project is hard to say. Uh I hope to be loyal to the project and not to n not to um let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something  yeah. I'm from Estonia uh  yep. Um so is there anything else you'd like to know? Oh  right  my roles  um so um in the different um stages of the design  so at first I will be responsible for um for yeah  designing the technical functions of the um um of the remote control uh then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to um come up with uh interface concept and then in the last um stage I will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design. Okay  that's it. Thanks. It looks very very cute. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Wow. Ah  a gecko  okay. Is a ar are they also like lizards or are they yeah  they are mm-hmm. Ah. Mm-hmm. I hope you don't like snakes  do you? Okay. Mm-hmm. Wonderful. Yep. I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones. Mm-hmm. Yeah but uh I mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones  because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems with l learning  yeah  yeah. Hm-hmm. Okay. Thank you. See you. Okay. So  this is uh first meeting of this design project. Um and I um like to show you the agenda for the meeting  I don't know if it was sent round to all of you. Maybe not. Anyway  this is the the plan for today's meeting is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly  um although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already. Then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other a little bit more. Um then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings  um specifically the whiteboard over there. Um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um and discuss come up with some preliminary ideas about it. And then that's it. So we've got twenty five minutes to do that  that's until eleven twenty five. S so any any questions? Is i not at this point. So this is our project. What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television. Um we want it to be something original  something trendy and also something user friendly  so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product. The method that we're going to use to complete the project  that has three components as such. There's the functional design of the the remote control. We're going the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that. Um similarly with the conceptual design  we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together. Um and then the detailed design will come after that. We'll pull it all together. I think it th w we're talking the the functional design is more your um area of things where you'll be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control and what what specific things it it has to do but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing. Um I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then yeah. Okay  so that's just a brief overview of the p the the project itself. Um what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for for the project  specifically the whiteboard. So each person in turn  I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard  the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name  what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project. Would you like to go first? Oh  yeah  p put them in pockets. You don't have to hurry  we've got plenty of time. It's got no eyes. I thought it might be a cat. Yeah I can see by the ears. Mm. Excellent  and what's your what's your role within the team? Mm-hmm. And more about yourself  you're from? Mm-hmm. But not with rabbits. Excellent  to match the rabbit. There's a an if you have not enough room there's an eraser there and you can rub it off. Ah it looks like a dog. the other legs are on the other side.. And where where are you from? Estonia. Good luck. Mm. It's eating. Yeah. Excellent. Right  now now it's my turn obviously. Okay  here's a space. Yeah  I like the cow. I'm Jen. Um I like dogs too  but I can't do that already because I can't draw a dog as well as you can. I like Mm. Hmm. It's a gecko. Yeah. They're Yeah  they're l it's a kind of lizard. And I I like geckos because they remind me of warm places and  and where I was living in Cambodia they used to live in my house and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening. I don't like snakes. I come from Australia and we have nasty snakes. That's where I'm from  Australia. I'm from Melbourne and I'm your Project Manager for today and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way  so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product. Okay. So  let's see what's next in the PowerPoint presentation. So  I've just thought yeah I've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally as there we go. Okay  so this is the um overall budget for our project. We've got um we're planning to sell these remote controls for let's make that go away  that means we've got five minutes. Um we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five Euros each. Um and with that we're aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros. And that's selling them on the international market  not just in the U_K_. Um so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target. So that's something to keep in mind while you're designing. Okay. Hmm. This is let me just skip ahead to see that's the last thing  okay. We've only got a couple of minutes. Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what we're thinking of this remote control? Mm-hmm. I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us  but if we all have a think  when we go away from the meeting  what specific things could be um included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary. Something something new. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing  or Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So  no. It could be one button for a menu or something  if you really need to go and do that. Mm-hmm. Excellent. Oh I haven't had a look yet  yep. Mm-hmm. Great. Any other immediate thoughts before we move along? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. It's like those fancy websites that you can't access because you have no idea how to get in  but the designers thought they were great. Okay  so we need to wrap it up now  so that we can go away and get on with some of this. Um we've got another meeting in thirty minutes  so you're you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace  but im basically you're looking at the working design  you're looking at the technical functions design  and for you it's the user requirements specification  like you said at the start. Okay? Thanks for that. Uh I'll see you in half an hour. Carry the laptops back again. Do we need to unplug things? Probably. Mm-hmm. so sh. I'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design? Uh i is it just uh more detail  uh as I understand it? Right. How how it will be done. So whe where do we identify the components of our uh product? Uh I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product? Okay. Hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Okay. 'Kay. Mm. Cool. Mm. That's not bad at all. Yep... Thank you. Okay um I'll do some I'll rub the features and let the drawing stay. 'Kay um my name is Gaurav. Um my favourite animal one of my favourite animals is a cow. I've got no idea how to draw a cow. Uh this is going to be Yeah  that'll do. Okay  so let let me draw the body first. Big  round body  really skinny legs and they've got a long tail and a long face. And there is some grass there. So this is what I like about cows that they just keeps sitting there eating grass  they do not disturb anybody um they're kind of Buddhist in a way. So yeah  I like cows. Um my my role in the project is um uh the industrial designer  so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product um ho how it works and whatever it'll mm take during the functional role  what are the various functions that have to be performed by it uh during the um conceptual design  what are the various components of it and um finally  I'm not too sure what was the last part. Um the detailed design  I I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other. Um I'm from India. Uh I'm doing my P_H_D_ in Psycholinguistics  I sit at the Department of Psychology. Yeah. Thank you. That doesn't look like a cow  does it? No way. Ah okay. Uh-huh. Mm. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy  user friendly and original so um I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned  that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this. Mm. Alright. Mm. Yeah. There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time  but will be used ten percent of the time  yeah. Yep. And then use the Mm. Mm. Uh we can aim for I mean we can think about all these little things  but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life  although I don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway  battery life  uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries. Um Hmm. Yeah. A big learning curve  yeah. Yeah. So  i it should kind of fit in as well  and the stereotype of a yeah. Alright.. Hmm. ,The project manager opens this conceptual design meeting and gives them the agenda. The industrial designer presents first and talks about the components of a remote  energy source options  and materials for the remote  case  and buttons. The interface specialist presents the interface concept by explaining the difference between graphical and command interface. They decide the command interface is most useful for a remote because it is simpler and more user-friendly. The group discusses aspects of the user interface including the lighting up effect and material of the buttons. The marketing expert presents on trend-watching and talks about how fruit and vegetables are an important fashion theme this year  and says the material used is expected to be spongy. The group discusses how they could implement these fashion trends into the design  then finalizes a few decisions about the components  materials  and energy sources. The project manager closes the meeting  stating what each member's next task will be. 
All set? Cool. Alright  it is PowerPoint time. I've done more PowerPoints in this particular experiment than I've ever done in my life before this experiment which is kind of fun. So uh here we have our detailed design meeting where we will um look at the prototype and um right so um  I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my that my coach was sending to me. It means I'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting. I think. I don't know. Otherwise it's just saying I'm the secretary and I'm therefore I'm taking the minutes  s so just to go um just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting  uh  I will open them slowly  no? Wait for it  wait for it. No. That's how the Wait. This is  this is very high-powered stuff here  double-clicking  there we go. So um basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh last meeting was that um we that we had meetings from uh we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer  uh or from Nathan  and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here um and what sort of limitations we're operating with um uh excuse me what limitations we're operating under  what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition  I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape um because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice. That would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users. Um  and uh the uh uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at. So. That's sorted  back to the main meet here  um  go ahead and take it away guys. Mm-hmm. Nice. Perfect. Oh  right. Oh well done yeah  yeah oh ok Edible televisions  it's a wave of the future. Brilliant. Brilliant. Cool. No  no I think that's Right  yeah thanks guys that's very  very good work. I like it  brilliant. Um  what we need to discuss now is the finance of it  um I got me you've got you provided a number that actually sounds quite nice. Um the trouble is I was just given this by finance. Um  it's a spreadsheet of the parts and I've just tentatively put in what it's going to look like um. I'm just gonna clear this out real quickly  but it looks like So we'll just if we can just itemize what's in here  we've got this it's a solar cell thing right? With a back-up battery? With the ba okay. Um and Clever  clever  well done. Um so I guess that would mean we've got a bit of a um It's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time isn't it? Okay. Um and the case  it's more of a single-curved case  I guess would be that be the general Um and we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout. Um. Push button interface um with this other drop-down so maybe we've got two push button interfaces don't we? Um. And um a special I guess it's uh we've got a sort of a wood materi a rubbery type material that throughout  yeah. Yeah  it's it's quite unique. I like it  yeah it's So it looks like a bit over budget  um. So what we could do perhaps  a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells um or take out the back-up battery. Uh Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. What's difficult  we have all these things integral to the um to the design of it that we just can't back out of now  it would have to be seems like we'd have to go back to square one in a way. Um if we were gonna try to undo one bit we'd probably have to undo most of it  um It's either or. 'Cause we can't remove the push buttons 'cause they're um and we can't get rid of the uh I mean removing the changing the case wouldn't be so much of a mm-mm  um  nor would changing the case materials. Um. So yeah that looks like to be the only thing. So that would be the it's a major change but Yeah. Alright  so we're in agreement on that. Right. Moving along swiftly. Um  so I guess now we just go to the project evaluation which I will allow Sarah to take over. Ah of course  sorry. Whoosh. That'd be great Brilliant. Hmm. Um yeah  I was just go on. Well they don't own tellys anyway do they? Right. So  um  this one's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair  um. I got this slide from the coach and I'm not sure what it's connected to. Um so I guess we are going to discuss um our project process um and that is gonna go into my report. So I guess this is the point where we go um uh out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and how that all worked  I guess  um. I think so yeah. I think it's I mm-hmm  I think so. I think hope I'm not screwing up an experiment. But I trust that she would jump in if I was so okay fair enough. Um right  um so any thoughts? Yeah. What do you guys feel about the process? Mm-hmm. No  no whiteboard. Was pretty cool tack though. Attempts to contact coach ineffective. Very natural look. That's the brilliance of they had a p they had a peeler in here. Yeah  I think  yeah re I thought it was like really creative actually  I mean. Including the s the multi-coloured wave pattern. What did you guys think about the the the roles? That's true  I I got this spreadsheet. Of what to do. Mm  mm. Cool. She said I I I she actually made a comment off boy you're getting into this and I really I think it's true I did get I I felt like I got way too into it. I felt like I slipped into it a lot. I dunno. The first time I've ever done anything like yeah project project management. I usually organise crap  it's one thing to do  you know set up a party with your friends  you know? But you guys felt that you could keep the  yeah  suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the okay? Yeah  yeah. Maybe in in Legos you know? Be fun with Legos too  like make a remote control or spaceship  we used to have spaceship Legos did you guys ever used to build spaceships with Legos everybody knows best spaceships ever. Um you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all? Hmm. No I  no I dunno  I d I I dunno  I don't I I was just I It's true huh? Yeah. Yeah. Course I'm I'm conscious of the idea of the Project Manager asking if you guys feel like there's a team you know it's like  kind of like  like hmm. It d But yeah. Interesting. It's kind of fascinating wasn't it? I mean the whole process of I don't know. I I don't know if there was a ri I th Mm. Nor I. I wanna see the output files from these um  from the digital paper. I wanna see wh wh what my my handwriting looks like digitized because my handwriting is crap. I mean  just to see what it looks like in P_D_F_ format or something. T I I'm curious about what the de-briefing is gonna be like. You know  like what is the uh what exactly we're looking for here. I dunno  I'm not sure what the new ideas found i is about. Well  that's the thing I got i in the email I got this PowerPoint file but this slide was just there  mm-hmm. I didn't change this one at all. Um ch Yeah well. W I kinda like th Yeah you can't Yeah. Does kinda make you wonder  I mean  how much can you do with a remote control? It's like inventing a new car. Yeah yeah  you can Yeah. Hmm. Um. 'Kay. So this was other costs. I dunno. I think this is forty ish I I I mm we should go on a bit yeah about the project eval  um. I dunno about you guys but I felt like a bit under-stimulated on the whole thing. Like  what like you know what am I really doing  you know what is Yep. Hey. Mm. I actually didn't do that at all though  every single one I a all the presentations I either added slides or edited 'em. I di Oh. What? Really? Did they not have they didn't like uh mine yeah they didn't come like this? Like with this was what it looks like. This is what that looked like  literally  just like that. Interesting. Uh-huh huh huh. Interesting. Any other thoughts come to mind? Yeah but Builds. Mm. Interesting. Uh  yeah  I'd say so. Mm  I know. It seemed like everything flowed pretty logically. You know from the the the basics to the conce although the whole concepts thing  the whole concepts phase  I don't think I really understood like the concept. Well the id okay the notion of yeah I mean i it's not like I have a concept of a mug's material  it's just it is what it is. You know  maybe i rather than concepts i it should be th thought of we sh I I thought of I thought of rather than in terms of concepts I thought of it in terms of um like proposed idea. And then the final would be like th the actual specified prototype or whatever  I dunno. But. All in all it's kinda interesting. No just this closing one. No we've established that the costs weren't really within budget  but we could s you know do it We did the project evaluation based on um Sarah's evaluation of on off switches and Mm. True. Yeah. 'Cause we di we had a thu think about it. Um. Yeah. And it's all recorded  woo-hoo. Yeah what I'm gonna I'm gonna put um I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so I'll put all that into the final report as well  or as much as seems like maybe not like the articles and stuff  like because and if and so forth  but I'll put most of it in the reports. Nice. Oh yeah. There's a whole branch of psychology that looks into that  psycholinguistics. Yep  they're called um disfluencies. Yeah we like our fancy phrases and terminologies for things. Exactly uh I will save this into the project documents. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah I know. Come on give me some information. Well to be fair we're we're hooked we're all hooked on the internet  so I mean I do the I know  imagine we went the first ten y fifteen years of our lives without the internet. It's only in the last ten that we're like where's the internet? I mean  you know  it just in the past five we've gone from twenty eight eight modems to broadband all the time. No we have but I not in the sense that it's so un you know uh ubiquitous Mm. Yeah that's our last step. Celebration. 'Kay I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part. Cool. Where do you find that? Is this one of those media player? W oh. The default track. I thought it was David Burns  look into the eyeball. That's one that seems to be shipping with it uh shipped with for a while  maybe this is the new version. Yeah  I guess we'll call that a a doner. Fab. Ready for this? Oh man. No it's important to we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here um f we call it fruity if you will. Um. Right  um  of course that's uh interchangeable and uh I think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued but this is kind of something that can be done um and as you can see on the television there uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there. Um. So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption. Um  what other things do we see here  well  um if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel  um  so I think that will work well with regards to our market. Um and uh let's see  well clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available. Um uh do you have anything else to add to that? It's actually important to note that the television  uh you know if there's an earthquake or anything like that  that i it actually is edible inside. Um it's encased in a new uh type of uh polymer yeah. It's fine. Hmm. It's pos a possible new product. Um  but I think that's I think that sums up the main features of our of the remote  um I dunno if you guys have any questions or f whether that uh whether we need to worry about any uh other marketing areas or anything of that nature. Um  did we come in under budget? Mm-hmm. Mm. Did we talk about the voice recognition uh option? So uh so uh yeah on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition uh uh console and uh I think it's nicely designed into the into the overall look. Um  but basically the voice recognition uh incorporates um the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw uh come up with. Basically uh quite similar to the coffee maker um design that we were talking about earlier and um  I think that uh has given a proven um ease of use and what not. And uh allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user um  so. Well we didn't quite have enough material uh. Oh I see  right  um. Right. Actually this bottom red ring here just unclips and then you put a a new a new uh a new plate on top of that. So I mean there are I we definitely priced out a spongy even spongier non-natural look um materials which I think worked out fine. We also continued on with the ideas that f following uh Apple's colour schemes with the kind of the uh light orange and the green. The voice recognition area actually doubles as uh as the solar cell area. Yeah. I mean I think that uh if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features  being environmental and without the batteries and what not  although it does still have a battery so I'm not sure that you know what the sell is on that. I mean you might be able to sway me on the idea that we our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing I mean that's what sets us apart right? And the reality is you know  for me from an ideological stand point  I'd like to stick with the uh the solar cell  but I h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here and uh you know I think I think that I think that we need to come to a compromise here and maybe move ahead with the project  without the solar cell. Savings. No  I think that was a good compromise you brought forward Sarah. Yep. They like that spongy feel. And the paging function works well  that's good to hear  we worked hard on that one. W we might have uh we might have lost that granola market again that we're I guess that's true. We didn't use the whiteboard at all. And Um  also had I not been intrigued about the pen  I don't think I woulda used it at all  I didn't write barely anything. Uh. Yeah. I so I don't n I think there was a lot of room for creativity  we could do whatever basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us  um. With the natural look. I think the teamwork was good as well. Well I think that was I think that was an issue I kept finding with regard to well no but also yeah when I was reporting about what each of us was doing I was often confused as to what you were doing um and then I also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was because that was kind of the interface portion which was what the whole project was about uh but and then in the end I think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more  which was fine. Mm-hmm. And I think your leadership was quite good. An so is that the first time you've taken on that kind of role? I had to admit  as soon as w we started I mean as soon as we got the Play-Doh  th you know the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window. Possibly. Oh yeah  still have 'em. Yep. I mean I think had the issue been more serious we probably woulda brainstormed more during our meetings as a team. Well I dunno what I woulda shown on that board. I mean it's just like the paper I don't know what I really needed the paper for. Um  because I've got this laptop. Standard  I just used it 'cause it's literally right in front of me. So is this all we need to get through? Is it Any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts? What is that? Our limited ability to think outside the box? Why? Huh I think it was the real. Yeah. Think it was also realisation of you basically just copy and paste what's given to you into your presentation which uh wasn't so clear to me at the beginning. Oh I added like five slides too  but I Yeah  mine too. No. I added many slides every time Yeah. Um. Even you. Actually that looked a lot more like a tongue from previous to uh fr some other design uh modifications. I hope you appreciate the uh incorporation of some tin foil from a uh random Kit-Kat bar that happened to be consumed. So again I reiterate my question of how different we are comp compared to the other groups  especially between culture groups and what not. Mm. What the uhs and the Mm. That's scary yeah? Well just around that eight or or nine people that are Dude  I think we've had internet for like eighteen years. In the eighties? Right. Yeah  it was to the like seven universities or something. You guys ready to celebrate? Celebrate. There is another one. Huh? Yep. Okay. Oh I totally Yeah 'cause I moved it. 'S put it over here. Then we don't have to worry about it. Huh. Yeah that's not you. Ah. Fair enough. Mm. Right. Appropriate  okay. Mm 'kay. It is an option. Ah. I see. Nice. Do we need to worry about um rot factors? Oh okay  there's preservatives involved  we don't need to worry  okay. Fair enough. No but It's a couple years off at least. Okay. Mm. Mm. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Mm 'kay. Right. Do we have um other  for lack of a better word  skins? Covers? In play now or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or? Do we know where we stand on that yet? Oh I wasn't expecting a prototype I just didn't know if you guys had any in mind yet. Okay. Just veneer really  yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. And the whole thing Okay. Right. Yeah. There's Okay. Mm 'kay. Okay  very cool. Okay. Okay. Yep. It's still an option if we need it. Very cool  nice job. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. M come in at sixteen? Yeah. Mm k. True. Nah. Although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental I mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marketing this as like a natural  new thing  but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget if I've done my math correctly. I mean Which  it's yeah that's what setting us into this young market  I mean that's where we started from  so I don't know  and I mean you know perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I think unfortunately that's our best option. Mm. It kind of yeah. Mm-mm. Yeah. Unfortunately I think we are. That would be me. Um cord? No problem. Can you reach  that would be great  thank you. I didn't even do that one on purpose either  damn. Okay  um  basically I was just evaluating um from what we know of how our product's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of these are the things we needed to do  these are the things that look like we feel they're important. Um so I was looking at basic design things  does it fulfil its functions as a remote? Is the design what we wanted it to do? I are technologies up to where we hoped they would be and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for? Um. Basic questions like  you know  does it turn on? Does it respond to voice recognition? And overall  in general  it looks like it's coming up to par. Um  the only thing is with with the pull-out panel  that is  can it take some adjusting because it's a new sort of interface  um that looked like it was coming up rough  but then  once you get used to it  it does make a lot of sense. So I think overall we're headed in the right direction. So. Yeah. It looks like it's going over well  so we're we're good yeah. Yeah. It's I think eventually if we do um branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into um wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff  but for now  what we've got is working in the range we need it for  so it's all good. That's everything from me. Yeah. Yeah  it is a set-back  but Okay  do you need the cord back? As in within the team or? Okay. It is now  you're in charge so there you go. Whatever. Um. I think they're starting blocks yeah. Um  you know I think in general  for a day's worth of work we actually were relatively productive  considering the little amount of input we had going in. Um  and the technology has definitely been a help  it's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff. No  we didn't. We could now if that'd make up for it but really and I feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints  doesn't really matter. Yeah I think I was taking notes more often than usual just 'cause I liked the pen  yeah. Mm. I am disappointed I didn't get a note back from my personal coach. Yeah  but I didn't get a response so we'll see. Okay that would be kinda creepy. Well what kind of coaching is that really? What if I really needed something. I think so. And even then we did get a decent product turned out although it's not everything we wanted it to be. Organic  really. And highly resourceful team mates might I add which is always a plus. Mm yeah  I'm impressed. Nice. All four of those little containers. Yeah. You could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours. Oh well. They were good. Yeah. True. Do your own. Though I did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day. I mean maybe it's just me but I didn't actually get any information for the last presentation at all. Nothing  I didn't even get an email  like that was it. So  yeah  I feel like that was slightly lacking but then you know  fill in the blanks on your own  level of creativity upped. Whatever. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh  that wasn't very much. Mm. Yes. Hmm  very much so. Yeah  already having the formatted stuff helped a lot. Very much so. Hmm. Yeah. That's kind of a good thing though  you know  give the rest of us some structure to work with so hey. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. I except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand and I knew we were all lying through our teeth  other than that I could only imagine. Yeah. Totally. I think so. Though we didn't actually I mean other than minor discussion at meetings there wasn't except for the actual building  but I feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming  use the board well and this would have been six months' worth of work  not like three hours' worth of meetings. That's true. Yeah that is kind of Mine was the mics. I didn't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires  I was afraid I was gonna break something actually. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. True  but it didn't even occur to me as an option  I mean I don't know that I would have but I know that I consciously didn't. True. Yeah. Yeah. Well it looks really professional. I know. I know  I felt like I needed to be professional so I didn't like draw all over my paper and stuff. Okay  well not entirely  but still  I doodled less than I usually do. I guess. Um. It did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that? That slide was like that? Well. Uh I think they still do their job. I am thinking outside the little square box though  with literally in like form I don't Yeah. It's still gotta be technically car shaped or it won't fit on the road  you know? Don't know. Kind of. Oh  how long was our meeting supposed to be? How much time do we have left? Mm. Yeah  at the beginning it started out and I felt actually like under pressure like the first couple were taking a lot of work and I was like had like all this brainstorming I was doing and then suddenly I was like well it's just another two minute presentation that you guys don't really care about anyway so type away. You know  you know what I mean like we all sort of knew where we were headed with it so it didn't feel like it mattered anymore. Mm-hmm. Whatever. Yeah. Very much  yeah. See I only got blank ones. My slides were all blank  they'd have a title maybe and they were just empty. Like with those words already on it? No. I wondered why yours always looked so more complicated. I think I added a slide one time. Hey with the whole new background being innovative  yeah that was class. Mm. I wanna know how our product would fare. I can't just leave it there. I think it would take extensive marketing  okay  an apple with a red button on top  even I am sceptical. But you know the whole Yeah. I know it is. Mm. I I noticed that. By accident. Well huh. An interesting day all in all I would say. I know. I Yeah. 'Cause it's such a functional item. Mm. Mm. We got it to be. Like cutting corners. Kind of  though it was really technically an evaluation of the product  not the project in general. Which I'm not sure is the same thing  at the time that just i made more sense  but I could see if they were really asking about us. Yay. Make it sound eloquent. Oh  I have to done I've I've done transcription before and it's really ridiculous how many words people say like just in the middle of their sentences like that that mean nothing. There's a guy studying it here  yeah  he's studying ums and ahs or something. Yeah. That's a good word for it. Just add some prefixes  sounds classier. I  yeah  pretty compulsively during meetings  like  yeah. Yeah  we are addicts. Mm. Yeah. I yeah. True. I yeah. But it's not regular I mean my grandparents had it in the eighties and I got it in ninety four  but still. Uh-huh. My um grammy does computer science back in the States and so they had um an E_D_U_ and gov network. There's basically the fundamental structures  but it wasn't uh household to household yet because it hadn't been partitioned off and stuff  yeah that was him. Apparently  does that include like champagne or something exciting? I think so. I think that's a closer. I have no idea. So is that a close? Okay  that's the end of the meeting. Thank you gentlemen. I feel like I'm signing off. Yeah. Oh really? Okay. Well. Uh  we have assembled our prototype  um. What's to be said about it? Um  we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting  um. Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions  um. This is going to be the on off button and we have these buttons to go through the channels um and then two volume buttons down here  d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons. And then  for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on. But this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away  um. As far as the uh whole visible light thing  we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out  why not? Of course  if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off. Um. Go ahead. That's this here. Um I worried about the materials  it is uh the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating so it's very durable uh  it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped. Um  and of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel. Fact  I dunno if you noticed  but I wrote the uh the company's name on the telephone screen  I thought that was kinda nice. This was actually an apple on the inside. This Yeah. We got a bit ahead of ourselves  I know we're not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that  but Right. Uh we did  yeah. This cost well to put this into um production  we're looking at about what was our goal? It was twelve fifty Euro um and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine. Um  so I was quite pleased with that. One thing that we didn't do um obviously we had a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons  but we just went for a classic rubber button and um since we did that we didn't have to use as many microchips which was quite nice and that's what helped keep the cost down. So even though it has a lot of modern technology  um for example the voice recognition  in a lot of ways it's just a simple remote and um I think if we shopped around for other manufacturers um we might be able to get even cheaper. And Oh no  we haven't talked about that yet have we? Hmm. Yeah. Any questions? Um  do you wanna answer this one or do you want me to answer it? Yeah  yeah. Um  well as you can see this is just a most superficial layer and um it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like It's not it's not quite a a face plate  it's more like a pseudo-face plate because it's simple enough that in the factory it could we could very easily put a different one on it  it locks into place such that  you know  it's pretty permanent but at the same time  if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way if you know what I mean. Yeah. Oh. Ooh. Right uh we didn't really touch on that but it it's in there  yep. Yeah  yeah. It's just making use of the same space and the same materials  but Yeah  one big curve I guess you could say. Yeah  mm-hmm. Yeah  special. And s I guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well  don't you? 'Cause it i it is very unconventional  I like to think of it as unconventional. Oh. Huh  doesn't match up does it? How do you feel about that? I mean we could take we could take the battery out of it you see and it'd probably work ninety nine per cent of the time but you're gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time when people are calling and saying oh look my remote isn't working what am I gonna do? People'd be real upset. I think in the long-run it's better to keep the battery  it's hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea 'cause that's so integral to the theme that we have. Yeah. Hmm. Right. Right. Yeah. I guess we might have to do that. It's the only way we're gonna get below our uh goal isn't it? Of twelve fifty. Yeah . Gotta do what you gotta do. Mm. Really good. Six? We did. I am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel but it's okay. Mm. I know. True. Okay. Right so it's just kind of a open mic kind of thing or 'Kay. Yeah. Are we considering these points here? Okay. No. Yeah  it's true. Mm. Definitely. As you write your personal coach. What if you get a response two or three months from now? That'd be weird. Yeah. That's very natural. Yeah. And to prove that we weren't wasteful we didn't waste a single bit of Play-Doh  we used every bit. Yeah  I guess My one my one criticism is that we didn't have enough colours to work with  we only had four  wasn't enough. I know it could have been amazing. Hmm. Yeah it's f kind of fun  it was I think it was pretty clever 'cause we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the right time and kind of filled in the gaps enough. At the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up  which was kind of fun. Yeah. Mm. You know Yeah. Yeah. That was fun. I think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the PowerPoint slides already put together for you 'cause if we didn't have that there's no way we could have got all that done in time. It was really good yeah. It's kinda fun. Yeah. Little different. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah? You don't. Yeah. Yeah. Wonder why is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the the board? Yeah  that's it 'cause the mics are loose and each time you get up it's s a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or. Yeah  that's it. Usually I would do a lot more doodling too but I didn't because New ideas. Hmm. I guess we're on the right track. No  none. I think they're fine actually. Yeah  maybe a s a circle would be alright  different. Are we back into project mood? Yeah. Yeah. Definitely when when I first filled out the questionnaire I was marking it probably higher in terms of how much I had to how much I stressed over it and then by the time I got to the last one I was like  you know  not very much. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Did you really? I just got blank ones and Me too. I deleted slides. That was pretty cool  it was a high moment of the whole experiment. I think it would fail  I think it'd be a huge disaster  especially if it looks like that. I don't we kind of designed it to look little bit like a face. It's a happy face. Yeah  it's uh I wanna see a Yeah. Hmm. So we have more slides or? Mm. Hmm. I It'd be so cool if we get a copy of the recording. Really. Filler words or? Disfluencies. I find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email a lot  just out of boredom  like c come on gimme something. It is scary. Yeah. It's crazy. So Should. Has it been forty minutes or whatever? this has been long enough. Is that the only song you have? That's awesome. Maybe I have a different one. ,The project manager recapped the events of the previous meeting and briefed the team on some new requirements the team must follow when designing the remote. The marketing expert presented research on consumer preferences and user requirements for remotes. The marketing expert also presented information regarding voice recognition and what demographic finds the feature appealing. The user interface designer described the technical functions of a remote and stressed the need for a user focused design. The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote. The team then discussed the option to include voice recognition  LCD  and a feature to locate a misplaced remote. The team briefly discussed who they were aiming their product to along with the idea of marketing their product to television manufacturers. The team also decided on some features to include in their product. 
'Kay  hello everybody. Uh  I guess you all know what is it about  you all received the email  I guess. Uh  we are actually doing this meeting to start a new project which is about designing a remote control. So I'm going to be the project manager of this uh project. And uh so I'm present myself. I'm Fabien Cardinaux and uh I I guess you can present yourself. So I dunno  you can starts. Okay. And you are? In the project? So  uh  so today we are doing a short meeting to present the project  so um We are gooding we are going to present the tool we are we are going to use during all this project. We are talking about the project plan  and we are going to to discuss about st our first ideas and so on  and  yeah. So we have around twenty five minutes to do this meeting. Um. So what is the goal of this project? Is to design a new remote control. So it should be  of course  new and original  and um it should be trendy  and user friendly. That mean it's a very challenging project  and uh uh. So w it's we will try to do our best  and hopefully come with something very new and that people want to buy. So  um So what's uh what are we going to do during this all this project? So it's more like we are going to do inv individual work all in o in o our specialities and we are going to meet each other quite often to discuss and to find a good way. Um. Yeah and everything is will be like this. Um so now we are going to to get used t to to the tools we are going to use all during all this project. So we can try to use uh the whiteboard here. So uh. For example we can try to write what is our our favourite animal and write the f our favourite characteristics about it. Mm. Uh. So uh So I will ask you all to do the same. Just to get used to the whiteboard. Yeah  yeah  you can draw the picture  of course. Oh. Never mind. Yeah.  no worry. You can draw it  if you want. Good. So good um So  let's talk about money. Uh we are going to to sell we want to sell uh this remote control for twenty five Euro Euro. And uh our expected profit will be around fifty million Euro. And uh we are trying to to have a market all around the world. So n not only for Switzerland  but for the world. Uh. So  um. The We expect a production cost of maximum uh twelve point fifty Euro. Yeah  of course. Um  so we can start today to have a first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control  and any idea? So  if you have some experience  good or bad  with remote controls you can share it and say what you f what is your idea. Anything. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Are you not afraid that if you take your remote control you can move the slide and it could the the volume can go up very quickly and it can Yeah  also if y when you take the the remote control  for example on the table  you take it and you push the button and everything is very loud  and you have a heart attack. Okay. Yeah so you can Do you have something? Yeah  that's true. Yeah without obstacles and. Okay. Let's continue. I have a meeting in five minutes  so maybe we should hurry. Um. So we will close uh this meeting. So we will have a next meeting in uh thirty minutes. Um. Uh. The So I will ask you to do some work. Uh the the interface interface developer will work on the on the design of the remote control  start to to have new idea and read about Yeah. Oh. Industry and Oh. Yeah. So  um For the User Interface Designer  which is Hamed um  uh  you are going to work on the technical functions of the remote control. And for the Marketing uh Manager  I dunno  okay  which is Bob  uh you are going to try to to find the user requirements f uh for the remote control. Um  you will receive by email uh the specific instructions and uh by your personal coach. Yep finished. So I see you in thirty minutes. Thank you. My name is Hamed Getabdar  and uh I'm going to be Interface Designer in this project. I dunno if I should go with this. If it is enough line. I'm sorry. Okay. They should be remote. Okay  thanks. No. Okay. Should I clean? Okay  I think like horses uh because they are strong and beautiful  so if I want to write it here  I think I can. Oh. Okay. I dunno if I can. Okay. It may be like a cow or I dunno  whatever. I'm not good very good in drawing. Okay  so this is very It's a bird  I think. I dunno what is it. Four. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. I'm shameful Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Uh I Yeah  just a simple experience. I uh I prefer um remote control working with radio waves  because remote control working with infra-red rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune. Mm. Yeah. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay  thanks. Bye. Uh my name's Bob Mor. Oh  sorry. 'Kay. So my name's Bob Morris. I'm the Marketing Expert for this project. Bob yeah. Yeah go ahead. Okay  okay. So I think my favourite animal would be a c a cat. That's its head. Um I probably like cats the most because they're cuddly and furry and uh playful. Okay. Thanks. Maybe put it up Put it a Maybe put it on the desk or something. Uh  that's better. Your lapel microphone's fallen off. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe we should just continue. Yeah  don't worry about it. No. Oh that's good  it's good. Yeah  and strong. Well  from experience  um I've had remote controls in the past that have had very they've had lots and lots of buttons and they've been very small  and it's been very hard to to to use  because there's so many buttons  and you know it's very hard to see which buttons do what  and the buttons are very small and very hard to press. Um and and normally you only every use  you know  on a T_V_ remote you only ever use  mostly  you know  f four or f six buttons. Um. So it's frustrated me in the past  th that. Ah  okay. Okay. Okay  n Is that because the of the discrete volume levels  or is that Yeah. Yeah. Okay. He's the Industrial Designer? No  you're the Industrial Designer. Yeah  I think that's the first. I_D_. Industrial Designer. And the second one is the User Interface Designer. And then last one's marketing  which is me. Great  okay. Thanks guys. Bye. Now what. Okay  so my name is Petre. You can call me Petre  or Peter if you like. I don't care. Uh  in the project I'm supposed to be the technic. Bob  okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So probably I would try to try to draw the animal. Well sh should I draw the picture of the animal? I I th I think I should. Okay  so. Um. Okay  American  um. Um. I would use the bird. So I tried to sketch it out. I had to first uh write it down because I am not absolutely sure if I can draw it  but ah. Can you recognise it as a bird? Okay it's your turn to Oh it's okay. Yeah. I should get used to the tool  so. Oh just wait a little bit. C could we put it here  to make it as straight as possible? Ah probably not. Okay  it it works like this. Are you left-handed? Oh  pity. Ah  it's maybe better if you leave it. You won't draw them  or? Just try. I would like to see how it looks like. No  I think it's clear. It's okay. It's in it's indeed beautiful. Okay. Bob. Have to remember it. Bob. Per unit  I guess. Y oh okay. Okay. Oh. Okay  I have also some points uh. Maybe two points. Uh first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light  so if you are if you are uh playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like uh back light. And maybe it could be also dependant on the the amount of of light in the room  so that if if it's in the day it doesn't need to be back lighted because it works on the battery  so. So something like this. And the second thing  f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is uh there are two buttons for volume control. But I prefer like a potential-meter or something like. You know  some slider or Not just two discrete buttons for volume  but something which Yeah  but I can reach In uh one second I can mute it down  or or make a high volume. Ah  n. If it drops to the floor then it starts to scream. Yeah  f It depends what what you feel about that. Yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards  but if you have some more notes on that. Okay. Um. Okay  just a second. Which i which is Hamed ? Okay. Uh I am the Technical Designer  I dunno which one  uh v. User Interf Okay. Okay  so I'm the first one. I see. Sign. Okay. Uh. ,The interface specialist and industrial designer presented their prototype to the team and discussed the features the prototype contained. In presenting the prototype  the issue arose that the prototype could only be used with the right hand. The team then looked at the production costs of the remote and found that their remote was actually under budget and that they could retain all the features they had originally decided upon without exceeding the target cost. The team evaluated the prototype on the basis of its look and feel  technological innovation  ease of use  costs  and its ability to be misplaced. Overall  the prototype performed very well in meeting all the criteria of the evaluation. The team then evaluated the project process  finding that they we re happy with their product and their performance in the project. 
So I hope you're ready for this uh functional design meeting. Um so I will take the minutes you mm you three are going to do presentation. Um uh we want to know to at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need uh to know the the user uh needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and um third part uh I don't remember which is not very good. Ah of course  how to to design this uh this yeah. So um let's go for the three presentations  so first um Marketing Expert. So wait a minute. Mm. Sounds uh Mm uh. Hmm. Okay. F_ five. Mm-hmm. Mm. Why not? Okay uh tha that's look great. Mm-hmm. Okay. Or something we don't know. Mm-hmm. Okay. I have been told that we uh don't consider teletext  that it's out of date now because of internet. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm Mm-mm. Okay. Mm I think it's good  okay. You done a good review. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm mm mm. Okay. That's good point. Okay. So um now I think it's the turn of the the I'm not sure um Of the technical function  so uh what effect Okay. Wait a second. Argh. So you're Okay. Let's go. Oh sorry. Okay. Oh sorry. It's off. It's on. Or you want to go to the kitchen. Mm. Um I see that you target uh several s application not only T_V_ but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control. Yeah. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. S Mm. Since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i issuing of this uh remote control I think we will only concentrate on T_V_ for the moment and then maybe m make it more generalised yeah. Yeah it's it's the same solution  I think. Hmm. Yeah uh on zap it's only next next next next next  yeah. Mm-hmm. Maybe we can make uh different modes for each button and you can change mode zapping mode or uh current chan Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Uh you're finish? Okay. So now the technical aspects of this new device. Mm. You prefer it. Mm-hmm. Okay. To make it quite uh an universal uh device uh. Mm. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And from from the discussion we had do you can you make it on the whiteboard  or mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. On Uh train it  okay. Mm-hmm. Mm. And what about the price of this component? It mm okay. Mm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. With a keywords and yeah. Mm-hmm mm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. No  in no not only speech  yeah. I it's an option. Okay. Sho to to train  okay. Mm. And well  what about the idea of automatic on off on the button  yeah. Wouldn't that make uh arguments? I want uh And we can increase this the strength y you can buy one with Mm-hmm. Okay. You have mm something else to say? Uh. No. Okay  thanks. So mm mm I think  okay  we're just on time. Um mm mm. So  we're now going to l have the lunch break. Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work  and um we will uh meet again for the next meeting  and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um on the components so uh you will focus on the component concept um uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching. So um of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach. Well I think that's all. And we have um maybe we have to we say  only for T_V_  not teletext? Uh I think automatic on off control uh it's not possible. Yeah  maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um. Yeah  implemented. O okay  we can think about that. And um do you see something else? Uh yeah that's Or maybe you want to phone him. Since now all yeah? Think Uh-huh. And uh And it's answered. Clap clap clap it's a good I I think it's universal. What about people without hand? Yeah. Mm uh okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm  so let's to think s so that yeah. I think that could be in the component uh concept uh. It yes. Okay. So  yeah  let's go to lunch. Sammy Benjo. I know this name uh. We met before. F_ F_ five. Agree. R_S_I_ mm-hmm. No  I don't think so. Okay. But twenty six percent  do you know Twenty five. Every fourth  you know. Every four some of us knows. One of us Mm-hmm. Functions. Mm-hmm. I got one question  uh you are a Market Expert so should we aim at the young people or not? Okay  then teletext is used less. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Okay. That's me. That's but this but number three  yes. Mm-hmm. So  my name is Mark Dwight  and um I am responsible for User Interface Design. However  uh mm Project Manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design. Uh  as I'm a more an artist that's gonna be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this. So next slide please. And uh a general method which is seems to be very useful for our task is not to forget about uh Occam razor. We should never complicate things too much. We should only make a remote control  nothing more. Nothing more than this  just a remote control. 'Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use. So  make a click  please. So here is this remote control. It's quite a standard one  but it's not from a T_V_  it's from a much easier device like air conditioning or something. But you know  we can use it for a T_V_ easily. Only buttons we need is on off  volume  channels and maybe some options or something else  and please make a click  compared to this one which one would you prefer? I guess this. Sure  sure. Yeah  and our method is going to be  provide simple simple desires into simple actions. Findings. Our question of the style  we should remember that our company puts fashion into electronics and we should never forget about it. Concept. Be simple. Be simple and you'll lean on this market. Market is a of remote controls you know it better  it's very well  it's it's not an easy field to to play  you know? So be simple. For personal preferences I think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium. It's a really good style  it going to be look like like this. It is unbreakable and it is very universal. W we'll have a screen with a back light which can change colours  and we can put all the options into this screen. We'll need only few buttons. All the other things can be controlled through the screen. And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click  'cause when you watch a movie and you want to change something  you always try to find a good button and click it  but you should do it by touching it and finding it easily just by touch. So Press I would propose this concept for design  just few buttons  a screen with a back light which can change colours  titanium I think  and uh what else? I got just very few and good ideas. We need power and volume. And let us include two nice features into this device  first  power on and off can be made fully automatic. When you go to the sofa  take your control and point it to the T_V_  the T_V_ turns on. When you don't touch the control but you go out of the For for enough time like uh you It's a question to our technical design  our two engineers. And another nice feature that I would like to implement is uh volume control. Suppose you set u you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you. Like  you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something  and then the volume changes. It's easy to do  you just control the According to the distance. Yeah yeah yeah. So I think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left  right  up  down and enter. So  its main purpose in fact is a back light  which change colours  which makes it easier to find  and each can it can respond for your voice  like it can turn on the light for you just to f find it easily  yeah? So basically that's it. Can be easily done  'cause you got simple designs  y we should put it to simple actions. Let it be universal  so you want to use it for your hi-fi system. You want to change tracks and you want to adjust volume. Just few actions  a few actions for everything. All the rest  we sh we'll put it into this menu on the screen. Okay  okay. Okay  but it's quite universal you know. We can just extend it to any device. Uh twenty five. Mm-hmm. In fact I would propose another solution. Basically you use just four or five channels  right? Yeah. So uh set up your T_V_ set like channels that you use they're one  two  three and five  and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel. Mm-hmm. Mm. We got these buttons here. Next next. Or say this can be back. Could we carry out some research if we w really need this  like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four? Okay. Okay. Alright? Thanks for your attention. Too complex. Okay. Okay. Um. Okay. No you know it's a conceptual question  'cause now I see th this the picture in front of my eyes like a user taking his remote control and shouting into it  volume up  volume up  and and he's coming you know  he's really annoyed with this  down  up  down. Okay  for this budget like twelve Euros. Mm-hmm. Okay.. Mm-hmm  mm-hmm. Did you consider the r gest uh gesture recognition? Like  if I want to put volume up I like do mm I take my remote control do like something like roll 'em up or roll 'em down. Mm why? That's just We got a really good Market Expert. Let's send more  let's sell more. Okay. Uh  should it be equipped with the uh  with uh speakers? Like  you want to find it  you shout control  and it answers is I'm here? Or Just beeps? I can't whistle. No  no  I can't. Mm. Okay. Just don't interfere with other devices like 'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping. Yeah  I got it at my home  like. Oops. So Of course. Nice stuff Who starts? Oh. Ha. okay. So I dunno if I can do that like this? Yeah? So it's being modified. Do you want yeah  open. Read only. I hope I saved it. So  um yeah  this is my name. So as you know  you I think you already know me  Sammy Benjo. I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls  and I hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly. So next please. Uh-oh. Hmm. Yeah maybe in the full page because i I spent lots of time doing this presentation  so. Uh-huh hmm okay. So basically uh what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control  let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls  what they like  what they don't like and um and what they do with them by the way because they are supposed to be useful. Don't forget about that. So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey. And next please. Yeah  so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls. First of all  they find it very ugly. Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour  not nice shape  I mean they're all the same  and they're not l good looking. Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were people are ready to pay for nice and look and fancy looking uh remote control  so I think we should probably spend lots of time in and effort in that um. And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls. For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another. And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used  so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using. Um next please. Now people are very frustrated w with their remote controls and they for instance uh they don't even find it it's it's often lost somewhere in the in the in your home and nobody knows where it is. Maybe if we have something where we could ask the remote control please  where are you? Like uh something to to like t I think phones. Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality. Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone but you can't phone your your remote control. But why not? Yeah. And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use  in fact they don't even know how to use them  so most of the the people say they they don't know how to they to use properly their r remote controls. And uh they are bad for R_S_I_ but uh I don't remember what is R_S_I_. So I think they are bad. Mm-hmm. Mm nobody has any idea about that? Well I'll check uh with my Oh  okay  I think it's a technical thing which our Okay. So  it seems that it's a lot of people for a concept that we don't know but we have to take this into account. So anyway that's for what the biggest frustration uh of the user and um what else do I have? Next slide? Ah yeah. So we've listed a couple of uh s uh functions that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls and uh well the tables look very nice to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you use it only once per session  but it is very relevant. People want to have a power button. Channel selection is uh o often used very often used and indeed uh very relevant. Ah now I remember what is R_S_I_ it's repetitivity stress injury. We have to be careful with that word but uh anyway I continue my presentation so yeah  channel selection is um very important  very often used. Volume is not often used but people uh want to have control on volume and that makes sense of course. And n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings. Audio settings  screen settings  even teletext and channel settings. All of them. they're not often used and they are s more or less relevant. It seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant  even if I personally never use it but seems that it's average relevant at least  so. I can tell you that uh in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant uh not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this  which is not as uh these these two one were had I think ten I think. But but if you compare with these ones  uh I think they scored a one or two. Not very relevant  so if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay but just know that people find it somehow relevant. That's for the main functions I think and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people don't have that may be useful. For instance I think net next slide. One of the thing the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control  so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want. So we've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age. Young people  probably because it's a buzz word  find it very relevant. And uh as the age goes up the the relevance goes down. So now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control? I think if we are targeting young people then uh it's probably something we have to consider. If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they this should be so now this is of course  depends on that. And um I don't have any conclusion  I didn't have time the meeting was very tight  so that's basically my findings. And uh  if you have any question? I can go back. Yeah one question  yeah? I am. I think we should aim at the young people. But uh I think they are they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device. In general the the early adopters of a new device are young people  less than more than Then teletext is useless for them I think  yeah. Because they they have other means of finding their information. Yeah. But yeah. Nope. 'Kay? So I think it's you  huh? No? No  user requiremen Makes sense. I would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button. Nice. Nice sentence. Mm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. And when does it turn off? Oh so you have a sensing sensor machine that uh knows Tech Mm-hmm. According to your distance to and the angle maybe  if you have a stereo system. Uh I'm not sure about the screen  wha what is the use usefulness of the screen? Uh is it a touch screen by the way? So it gives instructions but uh it has to be with an back light somehow. Okay. Okay. So for instance if I want to go to directly to channel twenty five  how would I do can I do that with this? Yeah mm let's say I am uh on channel eight now. You know these days we have hundreds of channels  that's not so easy to go just next next next when you have hundreds of channels. Or is it? Most people yeah. In fact in in one uh remote control that I've seen  instead of doing that d you could just say these are the cha ch channel three  twenty eight  forty eight and uh sixty four are those that I want to by cycled with my next button. I uh B yeah. Go to channel twenty five. One thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to z zap. So even if they are only watching four or five channels  I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels  just because this is one kind of thing they do  zapping. And it's only next. Yeah so but you have to Okay. So it would be Okay. Mm-hmm. Alright. Listening more. Mm-hmm. Okay. Well I could could uh have a look at that maybe. I'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that. Although I don't know. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But uh very very good to sell. Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them  and ha ha you cannot use my remote control  because it's targeted to me. Whatever. Hmm. Cheap. Millions. Cheap. The user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume or or it will be something like volume  up  down. Okay. Okay. Couple of words. Okay. Of course uh it has to be Okay. But then I think you you First of all I I think this is not uh functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons. It's on top of using the button. Well  I dunno. T_V_. Very expensive  no? And volume control. So but uh Sh should we target a a user personalised uh uh remote control? So in in a given room there might be more than one remote control. We would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings. Hmm. Yeah  of course. That's no problem  we will sell more. Yeah exactly. Okay. Thanks. Mm great. Difficult. Mm-hmm. No. Speakers in the remote cont Oh yeah. It just beeps. That would be enough. Something very cheap. But that's ex that's expensive. Uh. Well I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them and and they because of the the frequency they they just answer to that. You can't whistle. Uh-huh. Or a clap. You can clap. Can you? Clap is good. Tak Just a suggestion. With only one hand? These are not our target people. Mm-hmm. Oh that's e that already exists okay okay. Oh yeah  you do have. Wow. You're trendy. Think about it. Yeah  okay. Okay. Good we're done? Right  thanks. Yeah  it is put F_ five. The full page presentation  yep. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You can you are. Hmm. Yeah  it's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect. Yeah  because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology  and those waves have high Uh. Uh. Yeah it's People really Yeah. Yeah. Uh. Hmm. Yeah. 'Cause Thank you. Mm. Mm. Mm  yep. Thank you. Uh it's techni function of Yeah. I have to do working design so uh. Mm. It's Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Maybe it can be yeah middle of like  between those two li S you should yeah. Mm. Distance. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Yeah and it mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah. But even we can have some uh L_C_D_ display  like you can uh de you can just button the number and then it go t because Yeah. But still Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.. Yeah. But otherwise like we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press suppose two five they just press two and five and then Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  yeah. Yeah  yeah. Yeah but since we are focusing only on T_V_ remote controls so we can have more functions for T_V_ uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices. Yeah. Yeah. Two. Yeah  if Sorry. Yeah. Uh as you know  I am mister Ramaro. I am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices and I previously devised many uh like digital calculators and electronic calculators. So now I'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control. Well  as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device  like T_V_ or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera. So we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like T_V_. So we need to have some energy source to do what to do the functions  what we want on this portable device. And usually this so to do these functions we need an interface  which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that. And then these messages these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device. It's generally in the form of infrared or some kind of s sensor information. Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want. So  basically we need uh since we are focusing on our interface device remote control we need few components  mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want  and then we have some chip  it's mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are I am one doing mostly digital uh devices we ought to have some kind of processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format. And then we'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source which sends the information to the main device. Then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations  and we ought to do different codes for different T_V_s  so some T_V_s will have different encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things. Yeah yeah  because the people don't use one particular brand so or at least we have more more than five brands  which are really good. So we need to check their specifications and do their uh encryption that's passing information to the T_V_ device. So we need to have particular encryption codes. Then  components  so we have the main uh energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared uh source and then we have some inside some chip in in the device. Uh since I don't have much time so I'll input the connections to all this components. And since I also want to know feedback from our Marketing Expert and User Interface  so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them. Yeah. Yeah  I'm sure  because since our User Interface speech recognition and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy  so we can have another  like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip. Since we have some kind of uh energy this is our this normal battery  so this battery  once you s switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user so you just yeah  so that we just use simple recog no but but Yeah. No  even in you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So Uh maybe we can make uh it in five Euros and even less than that  because we want to have uh millions and in bulk  so we can make really simp and we want to make really simple device because we have only very few words like like power  switch on or some like then we'll have something like this um we'll have volume and then we will have s particular channel  so users can listen. Ye No  yeah  a user can use any kind of sender but they should have this prompt volume and then yeah volume and decrease or increase  so we try to only recognise those words and and because we can't really say user to say same wording then it become more mechanical and yeah. And then we can have channel they can say  okay I want eight  because we don't know like users have different programmes  I mean they don't really follow same channels strict uh so we just want channel number  we don't want like B_B_C_ or C_N_N_ or something else because it will be complicated so we'll have only these three uh main basic uh anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem  it's it it will be take care of our main mm. Yeah actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on  on and off  this processor and This really  suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power  volume and this part and this D_S_P_s. Again  this to have some interaction like suppose people use D_S_P_ then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form  like volume and like this key. So it may not be like very expensive  because since we are only focusing on T_V_ remote control so and we have only few things here Yeah. Um uh uh this point we didn't consider because it's it's very expensive because v our target is only like twelve point five Euros and Yeah  even automatic on off is also a bit problematic  because it different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really uh they just uh they don't touch the remote and mm y you don't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off and Yay yeah. Yeah that can be possible  especially for power settings  so user can say okay  suppose they're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay uh after one hour I They can make Yeah we can have Yeah. Uh  not very much  like yeah. Thank you. Yep. Thank you. Can you just yeah. Yeah yeah. Mark will Uh it's in current price  yeah. Yeah. But speech recogniser can be possible. Yeah yeah yeah. Yeah  especially the power  it really consumes because it should be all the time on and Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah I think it's good. But it's a good feature I guess yeah we need to think about more how to incorporate it. Oh. Ah it's Yeah. Yeah. Thank you  thank you very much. ,The Project Manager introduced himself and the project to the group. He presented an agenda for the rest of the project. The group acquainted themselves with the meeting-room materials by drawing on the board. The Project Manager discussed the projected price point  profit aim  and production cost for the project. The group discussed their initial ideas about the product design. They decided to make the remote a universal remote. They discussed the form of the device; it was suggested that the device could have a folding-open design or a touch-screen interface. They discussed energy source options and could not decide between using standard batteries or a recharging stand. They also discussed how to make the remote look more unique; it was suggested that the remote could feature the folding-open design to hide complicated functions on the inside of the device. The Project Manager instructed the Marketing Expert to prepare the user requirement specification and to research which devices the remote will control. 
Okay  is everybody ready? Mm-hmm. Um I take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do and um I think the Marketing Manager probably should go first  addressing the needs and desires. Yeah  mm-hmm. Okay. You're participant four. Okay  and now I can uh full screen. Uh  okay  okay. Uh okay  can can I at this point interject um something? Um we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be uh considered. Um the one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext  because that's sort of outdated with the internet  and according to to higher management the it should only control the T_V_  mostly because they feel that it's too comp complex a task to um to to include other things  and they are concerned with the time to market. Okay. Um and the and the third thing that they wanna make sure um that their that the corporate image is being maintained  and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product  so that it's easy that that that they can be easily identified as a product of of of the company  and that there's no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out. So I just wanted to interject this here so we're not getting too much off track here with uh with the things we wanna look at. These were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate uh these things  so it's only gonna be T_V_  but the one thing maybe that could be um eliminated is the teletext uh idea. Mm 'kay. Okay. And uh who would be next  uh  I guess that would be you. Mm-hmm. You want me to get your slide show up? Mm-hmm. And you are number three? Number two. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yep. Yeah yeah  uh-huh. There  mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yo and it's yeah but it's so. Yep. Yeah well yeah well that has been e that has been eliminated  so that's that's unfortunately a moot point now. Mm-hmm. Yeah I It just build a mould basically and uh you know. As the budget we're looking at if you build one mould I don't think that's going to make a big difference whether it's gonna be square or Oh yes. I think I think we will have to look at the budget on that but I think in principle that that would be that would be kind of fun  you know. Yeah. Silly for children. Like an animal or Yeah. Yeah  a little elderly  a little arthritic hand you know  and and it's a small button and and it they don't press it exactly you know something else happens n not their favourite channel comes up but something else and they're very frustrated you know. Mm  mm-hmm. Mm-hmm  mm-hmm. Yes. Yes. Yeah you're sitting there already or maybe you have no other uh Mm-hmm. Yeah  mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Holder  yeah  mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Well  you don't have to. This one? And Francine? You are number two? You're three. Would you want it full full screen? Mm-hmm? Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. On the on on the remote. Yeah  mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm. Yes. By your child  mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Timer  yeah  mm-hmm  mm-hmm. Uh okay  now I have On my slide show basically we already we have already done the agenda  and uh on the closing uh basically there will be lunch break and all that. However uh the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group. And uh what function  working design  how how does it work. So these are the two things we should come up wit with. So uh the first thing is pro maybe a little easier on uh who is our target group. Um. I guess in many ways everybody. Everybody who has a T_V_. Yeah  and I think today there are probably not many people who don't have a T_V_. There are a few but in general not. Now  talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody  but I think within the target group we have subgroups. We have we have earlier it was mentioned about um for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands  so I think that's uh one group that's certainly important. Um then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything um unless it's really very clear. And uh I don't know how much we want to cater to children's use. I mean that's a question um whether that's important that children can really use it or not. So this these are just some thoughts I have on it  and um I dunno what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're gonna design this one thing or whether we're looking at what we like we we talking about different shapes  whether that different shape also includes maybe different uh buttons uh for different groups. Mm-hmm. That has a lot of that has a lot of appeal but I think uh I'm I'm talking about the functionality now on it whether we're looking at different groups. I think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours. You know  like you make it nice and pink  fluorescent  banana colour or whatever you know yeah  for example you know. But the question is really  who is our target group. Do we look at one target group? And with the twenty five Euros you know can we can we afford to have uh I'm asking the technical people here whether um to look at sort of subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group how much would that throw us out of the cost we are supposed to respect? Right. With with Mm-hmm. Well that's that's Yeah. No The the quest the question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function  and I think the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons you know  within the target group or subgroups. The question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense. I mean the basic design I understand will be the same  but the question is how much will that set us back if let's say uh forty percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons for example. So that remains to s to be seen but uh the target group as a whole is is basically everybody with a T_V_. Yeah  well that's that's the question. Well maybe there's there's an idea you know t the new for example new portable phones? They have like removable plastic cases  so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one  or whatever  and maybe something like that  that in each package you know you have you you have you have for example uh you have let's say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have uh another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package. And then if people really want more colours they can buy it separately. You know  yes. That's right  and but like if if then everybody is is is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped or whatever they have as another one in the package  then they can go to the store and for a few uh Francs or Euros whatever they can buy an alternate package with another two colours in it you know for example you know. Well I think I think the idea here is to uh to to d design one remote and what the only change is gonna be um the funct d t yeah uh the functional functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way  um having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people uh either for children um Five minutes that was I guess tha that's the old message. Finish meeting now. Um um. But I think I I think to sum it up the target group is basically everybody. If money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that. Do we agree  do we? Do we agree on on that in principle  like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not. Okay? So now I understand it's lunch break. And um. So that's what we will do. So hank you very much. And we'll see you after lunch. Yes. Okay. Okay. What features. S sellable. Yes. Yes. Okay. Okay. Receive. Multi-purpose. Eliminated. Mm-hmm colours. Yes exactly. Yes. Like a doll  or Yes. Yes. Okay. Something else. Channels. Yes. Yes. Mm yeah. Yes. Hmm. Okay. To keep the remote? Yeah. A case holder. A holder remote holder. Participant two. Yes. No no  I'm three. I can make it full? Yes yes yes. Okay. As uh User Interface Designer I did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote. Yeah can you please go onto the next slide? So I found out that uh but uh the main purpose of a remote is to uh f control the function of a television at a far off distance at remote distance. Now for that  uh a remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the T_V_ and he can control the functionalities different functionalities of the T_V_. There should be a signal uh something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a LED which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to uh change the channels or increase the volume he can change it. Now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular a particular programme or switching on and off a uh a particular programme according to the user choice. Yes. Yes. So if if he want to view a particular programme at say nine o'clock he can set the time  and the T_V_ will automatically it will switch on at that particular time. So he can use that kind of uh uh properties of features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular uh for a certain age  then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children cannot view that channel. And uh the uh the uh and the one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote. Uh t the remote should be compact and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the T_V_ television. And um uh as uh uh this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a T_ in alphabet for more compactability. And uh and uh and it is one more point which I noted it down  like uh the material which which which is used for remotes should be human friendly it should not cause any skin disease or something some al allergy to either children or to um ad adult person. And it should have an uh it can have an alarm clock a a person if some if somebody wants to get up at around eight eight P_M_ then he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock  and I don't think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote. Yes  and as John Reece said the buttons can be  uh can me we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons so different uh buttons will glow differently. So in even in the dark the user can know what buttons to use to switch on a particular channel. And uh uh the design of the uh um remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections so that if a child plays with a remote  he uh he should not be harmed in any way. And findings  uh I found out uh y um on different sites that uh there are different remotes which can be used  there are remotes which use the infrared for controlling the different functionalities  there are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions and there are uh So uh there you have different uh types of remotes for different light source which are used which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of a television. Next slide. And these are my few personal preferences like it can be used for a multipurpose use. Not  uh no uh like it can it can be used as a T_V_ control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm a timing and it should have a child lock  and then to save electricity uh there should not be uh much s move uh lots of circuits and all that. And if a person if if if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten o'clock then it should be switched off ten o at ten o'clock automatically  so that nobody else comes later and use it. Timer. Yeah and then you can use a timer as well. Yes. Yeah that's it. Okay. T_V_ television we was. Mm-hmm. Different colours. Yes. Okay. No uh generally we can we can design a remote which is mainly for people with uh f age from ten to um forty and and then we can add on uh specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people wit with who have nervous problems  yes. But in a family in a family there will be a aged person  children and a middle aged but they cannot buy three different remotes. They would like to buy just one and um just one which can be used all the three uh Cost effective. Okay. Yes. Okay. Um Yes. But uh yeah I I have a doubt like will it be cost wise effective if we if we design a remote having all the uh different features for different people or designing three different um remotes for three different categories of people. Okay. Of th okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay  mm-hmm. Yes. Okay. Yeah I'd to just put on my microphone here and I'll be right with you. Okay? Okay you want me to start right now? Okay. Well  could you um put my slides up 'cause I think it might be helpful if uh we looked at the slides at the same time. I'm participant four I believe. Yes uh-huh. 'Kay. There we go. Okay well I think we have introduced ourselves  so the functional requirements are is is part of my goal but why don't we pass right to the second slide. Cause that's where m my discussion starts. Right well um since I'm in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since I have to try to sell it. Um I thought that the method I should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody  and th the reason I just put that there like that is that uh in the init in the initial stage I think I should just be open to lots of suggestions. You know you can say anything you want no matter how silly it sounds you know it should run your car  it should heat up your motor if should um turn on your C_D_ whatever you want it to do um and then as we go on what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to um design and budget feasibility. So I'll be coming to you um frequently as the Industrial Expert to tell me how hard it's gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it's gonna be or if your time  if it takes five years to develop this it's just something we can't do. So in the beginning just have a big puddle of things that we anybody can th throw anything in and then just weed things out that can't be done for one reason or another  and then the things that seem the most attractive that to uh to a customer we'll try to then prioritise those. So that was um what I meant there  and as I said on the slide there consulting the Industrial Engineer about that and the other thing is timing is really gonna be as important as money  because if we're gonna sell this thing  I think the best time to sell it is as a Christmas present. Twenty five Euros makes a nice little present  and we want it to be an impulse purchase  we want somebody to see it and think it's  gee I just gotta have that. And take out their wallet and buy it. So it's gotta be really attractive and it but it's gotta go to market by September  'cause anything that you don't already have out there in September showing it around  isn't gonna sell for Christmas. Um and then I'll be coming to you as the User Interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to prior help me with that prioritising of uh of the features and of the the look and the colour and I'll be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view. So I'll be coming to you for how much is it gonna cost us and how long is it gonna take you  and I'll be coming to you to tell me what's gonna make somebody take out their wallet you know  what what's what's gonna really be what they call a sizzle  'cause we gotta sell this sizzle. A lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just gonna take out their wallet and buy for Christmas for for their child or for their husband or whatever. Okay can we go to the next slide please? Alright I I already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the uh the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible. So I'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where I was saying we we could suggest anything. I'd like the suggestions to be really specific  so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off  not something like you know whole house control what'll be And then I found on the internet from from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible. At the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at  we should be able to make it work the T_V_  the V_C_R_  the stereo set um maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp. I have to wind up? Yeah  sure. Okay. Okay. Of course  yeah. Okay  so that's something Okay so Okay. Alright  thanks for that. Um alright now other things that I found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now. 'Cause a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use  and that was thirty four percent but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room. Um so those are two things that we definitely do wanna address  uh we wanna s make it as simple as possible  we wanna make it um obvious and intuitive to use  and then the things about finding it we talked about the a light emitting thing as well as uh maybe a beep  and I think that those are things after my research that we definitely wanna try to incorporate. 'Kay can we go to the next slide please? Okay  so  my personal preferences in this um project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle. That is the selling point  the thing that's gonna make it an impulse purchase. Uh because once there's no be-back  well in sales they always say you know  be-backs don't come back. If somebody says  oh I'll come back and get it next week you're dead. They're never gonna come back and buy it. You've gotta make it attractive enough so they buy it now now now w now is a big word in in my book for selling this thing. And  in order to make it really sellable we've gotta shorten the learning curve  make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use. We have to have as few buttons as possible  because more buttons is more confusion  so that's why I'm saying  simplicity is good. Finding it's important  obviously you can't use it if you can't find it. So we've gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it  and I've already said this several times but I put it down in writing here  it should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five Euros. So it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say  uh twenty five Euros I'm not gonna take that. Has to be so great that they're gonna say  uh twenty five Euros isn't much. Um and then maybe a motto  like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign. Okay that's uh about it for me right now. Okay. Mm-hmm. Signal. Mm-hmm. Yeah well that's already been eliminated by management  so we're off the hook. Mm okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well we already eliminated that. Now that's good from a marketing point of view  the fun the fun shape. And that you you say that won't add too much to the budget? To d the shape is uh Do you think there's any chance of um having ser in having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes? Is that gonna be a possible? 'Cause that might help with the marketing. Because we had something sort of sexy for adults and we could have something sort of silly for children or a little animal shape or in a or a little elephant so they can remember where it is. Mm. Well  I think I think that that's something that we'll have to discuss um with the User Interface person because I think there's a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature. Because I think one of the things were complaining about in my what I found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one. The changing modes was something I mean you and I  all f all four of us we work with computers all the time  changing modes is nothing for us  but people who N and And that's and that's the kind of thing people learn by feel  and um you don't feel the mode change. So um maybe having buttons be various shapes might be a help too. You know  like the a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels  so that people can uh develop a tactile sense of it. But we'll get to that with you. That's right  yeah. Now that's a good point. Yeah. Yeah  that's that's a good that's a good one  because the clock would be really friendly  and and when is your favourite show coming on and Yeah  and a lot of time there's not a clock on the screen  and you have to go somewhere but you just wanna look at the news for a minute. Yeah that's that's good  the clock is good. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Case. So it um we should visit this site and have a look at uh what's up there? Or Okay. Okay. So it might be helpful if we had a look at that. Okay  thank you. Could you go back to that slide where she had that uh s slide up Betsy? Yeah  okay  thank you. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm  'kay. And an alarm clock  yeah that should that should be okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well you know there's the old motto  children under six never shop alone. So if you've designed something that's very attractive to children um the mummy please mummy please um you know we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it um that has uh a lot of marketing pull. Mm-hmm. That's right. You can make a banana shaped one. Mm-hmm. Respect. Mm. What about the electronics? That's not really gonna change much  is it? That that w that won't change much  will it uh? I d I wouldn't think so. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's right  and can we can we is it even feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone  or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes? Um the same electronics and basically all that's gonna be different is the plastic case. And in that case we could probabl moulded plastic isn't all that expensive is it? Um you as an industrial person? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well there's a real idea yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Right. Mm-hmm. Uh yeah. An alternate package. Yeah. Okay. Well I think we can only aff  yeah. Cosmetic. Warning  finish meeting now. Well we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but um Mm-hmm. Okay but we have to l Okay  fair enough. Okay. Yeah? Mm? Open. And then full screen. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm hmm. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Complicated  yeah  of course. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah 'kay. Yeah yeah sure. Thank you. Number two  yeah. Yeah exactly. Uh can you make it uh full screen please? No  it's like a well you you have to press here. The cup cup shape here? The thir third. Yeah exactly. Uh so today I'm going to talk about the working design of the remote controller. Um can you go to the next sli slide please? The metal is like uh in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller. It takes the power from a battery say a battery it it can be a elec an electric supply like you have to uh like uh switch connec connect connect your remote controller to uh power supply from the you know electricity or something like that. It should be a battery because uh uh remote controller should be like you you you should take it t to wherever you want and then um uh th this integrated circuitry takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it's like a input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device  like a T_V_ or a air conditioner  something like that so. Uh a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device. If you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like uh th the remote controller it sends some bits some uh waves like with a particular frequency the device should know what the frequency is. It should re re recognise the uh waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press a button channel or something like that then uh the remote uh remote controller will send a send a se send a signal  and the T_V_ it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that  change the volume control and uh so uh I think it's hard to design a remote controller for multiple uh devices. Uh yeah. Um. So uh user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user user in interface like you know switch pad or something like that buttons should be there. So uh you can control whatever you want  you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you you want to uh mute uh mute the uh T_V_ or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there's a there should be some device to tell what to do to the uh in uh integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can s send the signals and T_V_ can perform the actions. So can you go to the next slide please? So I I just would like to uh add some extra features to the remote controller um I think these are the very simple features and uh they don't take much uh uh much of the um um investment also  it's like el the text or buttons which uh which are there on the uh remote controller they those we can make uh um like fluorescent uh they'll be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote controller if it is dark. And ther there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a and she she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it's this this is not a a you know a a action  there can be no action taking to that so. And there should be a child lock  like uh uh you should be able to lock your remote controller so that uh um whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can't be like y you i you if you have ki kids and all then they'll be pl playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller. If make it useable for more than one device it's a it's hard but I think it's possible but it uh yeah yeah yeah so it's it's okay  yeah  yeah. And uh different shapes that we can do like uh we can have you know a all animals shapes or you know comfortable uh whi which can fit into your hands and um so that uh Yeah  yeah  yeah and colours also  different colours  and No no no  it won't uh I don't think it will be like  you can have you know for uh if you want ther there to be more Yeah yeah. It's it's just a s shape so it doesn't matter. Yeah. Yeah that is also possible I uh yeah I I yeah. Yeah that will be Yeah yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah  for children  yeah exactly. Yeah  that's what  yeah. Yeah  exactly. Yeah. And and the butto buttons also I think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons. If there are more buttons then it will be more complicated. If you have less features then your remote controller won't be attractive  so I think uh we need to make some buttons which are which are like um uh f in uh in intended for two or three operations  like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel  if you press the other button in another mode it will change the colour. So if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but I think it will complicate the matter more I think so. Yep  yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah  it's like you know yeah. Yeah. Yeah  yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah  yes. Yeah  yeah you don't us yeah yeah  usually. Yeah. Yeah shapes also  different shapes. Yeah that will Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  yeah  and also text should be very clear so that there there won't be any ambiguities and uh So yeah. And uh display clock i if you want more features then we can display a clock it I I don't think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit I think we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit so it's Yeah  and we display a clock. Yeah. Yeah  and then you can just see your remote controller yeah yeah yeah so Yeah. Yeah. Uh can you go to the next slide please? Uh components uh the main components we need for uh it ha like buttons and uh underneath that there should be switch. And uh bulbs. Like uh we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or uh whenever the T_V_ is on suppose  then the remote controller should automatically have a b s light. Then it will be like if you switch on your T_V_ through anoth another source  not from through a remote remote controller and you you lost your remote controller maybe you can find with the light. Maybe we can have that. Whenever the T_V_ is on  remote controller will have a light. And then uh infrared bulbs. Um this is like uh when it is dark. And battery  there should be a battery for power supply  and a chip  chip which is like a brain to the remote controller which does all the operations  and wires connecting all chips  which is uh lights  everything  so there should be wires. And uh uh of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things and  you know different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to put to give a shape. Yeah. Yeah  holder. Um uh can you move onto the next slide. Um next sli slide please. Um I have referred the site uh the homepage of the um our website  uh from where I have uh uh I got s few points. That's it  that's it from me now. Um. Uh it's not like that  I have referred the page to get new ideas or like what can be the working design to how it works and all and so and so. Yeah if you want. Yeah  it's okay. Uh  it's actually there now  there on the screen. Mm. Yeah  sure. If there is a clock then there can be a alarm clock. Hmm. It's like a t okay  it's like a timer it's like a lock to the television. Mm  T_V_  yeah. Don't T_V_  yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. We can design different remotes for different people  like for aged people there will be big buttons and you know. yeah. Children and everybody  yeah. Yeah of course that we can do  but specifically if y if like elderly people want big buttons then you can't really make a bi big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a big con remote controller for elderly and for children  like in a different you know. No  it it doesn't cost  yeah. Yeah. Doesn't doesn't doesn't matter. Yeah. Hmm hmm. Uh no. Mm  I I I don't think no. It's not. Hmm. Yeah  like for mobile phones we have uh different you know covers  like designs and all so that w we can have that. Yeah. Yeah  but uh Yeah. Yeah  maybe  yeah  yeah. If we do some more research  maybe we. Hmm yeah  I think maybe seventy percent is a unique uh uh remote controller and thirty percent is yeah it's sort of like yeah. Yeah  yeah  of course  yeah. Mm-hmm. Thank you. ,The project manager reviewed the minutes of the previous meeting. The marketing expert discussed the results of trend watching reports which indicated a need for products which have a fancy look and feel  are technologically innovative  easy to use  include a fruit and vegetable theme  and are spongy in feel. The marketing expert stressed the need to incorporate these findings into the team's design and suggested that the team should create a remote that has limited buttons   can be personalized  and is not rectangular. The user interface designer briefly described how speech recognition technology works and what ways a user can use a remote. The user interface designer presented three existing products on the market - a voice recognition remote  an iPod  and a children's remote - and discussed a few features to include in the team's design. The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the restrictions involved in combining various components  energy sources  and materials. The industrial designer also discussed with the how to incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme into their design. The team then discussed and decided what components  materials  and energy sources to use. 
Mm-hmm. Marketing Expert. Mm. Okay. Yeah. No sure. Uh it's David Jordan. Course. Mm-hmm. No  no. Uh this one doesn't want to be moved  I think. So  I dunno  it's maybe difficult to have both  I mean the the one on the right doesn't look so simple and Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  and then Yeah. Oh it should okay  yeah. The user should know. Yeah  that's gonna be the trick. Okay. So that's the point. Mm. True. Okay. What the cost is? Twelve  twelve a half. That might just So. Okay. What's the average price of this technology then? But this is what you would like to ask the user first and I don't think the user would be ready to have a I don't think well  yeah  I don't think he would  but in a sense The wire? Yeah. True. Uh that's my job. That's the Now the Yeah. Well that's actually one of the point  yeah? True. This you will see in my presentation then. Yeah. Which is participant four. So just trying to answer all the questions  if the user would be happy to have something or something else uh. We've made a study  so could you go to next slide. Sorry for the functional recurrence. So that's the standard method for marketing  okay. We had one hundred subjects  um  we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire  um  and see what was okay or not for them. Okay. So then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered. Um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly  okay  so that's Yeah  the the look is is bad for them so uh it's your job  David  maybe. Then eighty percent of users would spend more money um actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly. So this is where we could have uh yeah  good market  I guess  if people are ready to pay more. So it's it's interesting information  I think. And then um yeah  the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so doesn't fit the user requirements sometime  because it's too many buttons and so on. So we should change this as well. And uh users are actually zapping a lot  so they're using the device intensively  that's something to take into account as well. And um  you know  ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control. And uh this is one of the main point for me. But I'll come back to it later. 'Kay. Could you go next slide? Uh  so as you said uh  remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room. So this is from the experiments we've done  so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user  I think. Um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people. And uh remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users. R_S_I_ is like  when you're using the same um doing the same movement several times  then you get injured. Okay? So  those numbers are less important then the previous one  but still it has to be taken to count. So last slide. Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs. If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent  okay. And definitely if it could have less buttons  still maybe the same number of um functions  but less buttons  this would definitely be a good way of selling more. Okay. So Yeah  remember the user is not happy to read the manual. It's Yeah. Yeah  this is something we sh But this was first step and This was the first step  yeah. Specially distribution  yeah. Uh Yeah  but this is what we would ask to the users  so. Yeah. Yeah  remember it's twelve Euros. Hmm. Yeah  it's done  just yeah. If we would if we could remember like  not too many buttons and make it look fancy  I think it would make it. So. Lame  or Mm-hmm Yeah. Mm-hmm. So has to be yellow. I don't think it's part of the remote control design anyway. It's maybe more in browsing. Yeah. Hm-mm. Mm-hmm. Min Yeah. Regarding the first line  what So we're just expecting no more use of the teletext. And that's it. It's already changed for Mm-hmm. Industrial Designer. Yep. Okay. Yeah. Industrial Design. One one. Three three  it's three sorry. In one  sorry. So you didn't save it maybe. Alright  so David Jordan? Mm-hmm. Too great for email then. Yeah. To merge the two system huh. Mm yep. But But this is Yeah. Yeah you maybe you have some international standards  where you know  if you can use one is the other are or almost the same  so the sign. Yeah  yeah. For example  I dunno here  escape  you know  you have escape in computers you have  so if you see escape  you know that it should be the same. So you have to The sh the user there for example the power off button it is something very international  you know that So. Yeah. So. Yeah  but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system  alright. That's your job It you Okay  okay. Participant two. Yeah. The rationale must be design  or So we can move to the next slide. As you all know  you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control. So the re basically the remote control will be  you know  infrared control  so the problem is how to relate the how to relate the remote control device  like for example this one I h I'm holding in my hand and the T_V_. So  this one is leather bu based but I propose a nifra infrared base you know  so so for me I think that it is better it's bet it's better to control T_V_ so you know  so it's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than  you know For the cheap price we have  for the cheap price we want to I think it's cheaper than laser  so. Yeah  I think for the cost we want for the cost we want it's better to have uh uh Let's see. Yeah. You can move to the next slide  so. So the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just  you know a bulb and an infrared bulb  so here for example the infrared bulb will be here and the bulb it will be somewhere inside. You can go to the next slide. I have some kind of pictures you know  here. You have the b the bulb  it is a blue the blue stuff here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important  so. This is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device. Look. But here what I wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and. So and the next slide  it is the last one it's So it's I think it should be wire wireless re remote con Because you know  it's easier to manage and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you. Or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both  but you know  I at my side prefer a wireless. Okay  so if you have some question I didn't answer? Well the avera the average prices I think that this technology will cost  I dunno  around eight Euros  so. Or at least you know  the You'd yes  you can. It's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know  put some energy inside  so you can think about wireless or you know it's it's a question that we can raise  so. We can think that you know  with the wire  you know  without a wire. We can have both also. Yeah  but some pa I always want to have you know  sometime I want to have wire because you know. Uh  I don't think it will be too much. Have to think about the question  you know  'cause it's I think that you know you can always you know I think wha wha with the wire it's mm cheaper but you know the wireless it's more practical  so. Okay  yeah. Yeah but  it should be an agreement  you know  because even if you can think of the wireless  it is it's it is the job of the the the g Graphical User Designer  but you know. If it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some the the money you have  if you want to use  so it can be good to have a wireless  it it is a question. Right  so. Okay. Mm-hmm. The look  how it look like. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. The manuals. With a Look fancy. This is a question that should be asked to the If you ask the people  maybe the the marketing people. I think the solution is to have many colours of you know instead of having one grey standard Yeah  yeah  maybe. Yeah  maybe. Yeah  yeah  yeah. Yeah. Yeah  hmm. Yep. So. Yellow. For cheap remote control  yeah. Yeah. Yeah  'cause what I'm thinking is how will you will connect the T_V_ to internet  so. This is Yeah  but this this mean that your T_V_ would be able to  you know  connect to internet  you know  surf the web. Okay. It's pop I don't think it's popular  so that's the problem so. You had i if you are designing a remote control for you know the global usage  so if people don't have the technology. Yellow? Do you think that people like the colour yellow? I think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double R_. Or should be. Yeah  so. Doesn't need to be completely yellow  but just mm. But I dunno  but why  nobody's a threat to me. Industrial Designer  yeah. Component component  yeah. Good. Okay Okay  that's clear. So  I will open our functional design meeting. So  I will play role of the secretary. As also Program Ma Manager. So  we will have the three presentations from the In Industrial Designer  User Interface Designer and um What's your talk? Marketing Experts. And after that we uh will have the uh new product requirements  the decision on the remote control functions  and we will close the meetings after. Mm so um I suppose the first to do the presentation will be the User Interface Designer. Um  so you're participant two? No you're No  I'm participant one. Okay  never mind. 'Kay  did you save your presentation? Isn't that technical functions? Name's Jordan. So so I'll I let David Jordan do his presentation. Uh. Mm. So you propose to to have the remote control which will be powerful. So powerful  many functions and very easy to use. You mean this one? Yeah you have to learn the manual before using this remote control  I suppose. Oh you mean for the yeah pic pictograms or things like that? Yeah um such as maybe the Go on  go back and So  you will propose us something which is yeah so powerful and easy to use. Okay. So  next I propose the Industrial User Interface to present things. So you you're Um. Okay. So  Baba is the uh the Industrial Designer. Okay. Mm-hmm. So you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology? Yeah. Do y you know the requirements for the remote control? Twelve  nearly thirteen  yeah. The cost Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. What is this? Okay. Okay. Okay. So you think that uh a cable between the remote control and the T_V_ won't be a good idea. No it wou maybe it will be cheaper I dunno  I just may maybe you making a solu Yeah  but Yeah but as Industrial Designer  do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television? I'm just asking you. Do you think it will be cheaper? Could you answer please? Okay. Yeah  but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem. As it's yeah. I think it's more your problem. Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not. Okay  I'm sorry. So So just think of um the usability. Yeah. Just think of the problem. If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it? I think it's would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television  yeah. So I will let you to do your presentation  so. You mean the loo the look  the outside? Okay. Mm-hmm. What is R_S_I_? Ah um okay. Mm-hmm. Mm okay. And just to have uh an idea  do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control  you think it's possible? Sure? Yeah? Yeah. Yeah  but do you think it will be easy to use? Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know. Yeah  I think the Yeah  but it has to be intuitive. Yeah  okay. Okay  but Yeah  but Mm-hmm. Yeah  but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control. If you need to have special colours for remote controls it will cost more. Yeah  it will cost little bit more. And also f Yeah  but as soon as you speak about options  it means that the price increases  and we don't really want the price to be too too high  because we wanna be able to produce it. So  we want something fancy  as uh previously said  Florent  something very easy to use  powerful and also as uh it's written here  seventy five percent of users  they zap lot  so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot. And they don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control  they want to zap between channels on T_V_. So I think you have quite lot of points to to think about and to discuss it with uh the other members. So  is it okay for your presentation? Nothing else to to add? Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm so So  I had some new information about the product requirements  so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking  in your designing of the remote control. So the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore  as it's something that's It's is uh No yeah  because now everybody has internet at home  so it's better to use internet then teletext. So  you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control  and also the remote control will only be used for television  so for y for you your designing  you're not you won't be uh you won't had um buttons to just to manipulate yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that. It's because if we want to to do remote control which will be used for for the television  for the recorder  for the camcorder and all the others  it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we can't do that. We really want to focus on the remote control for the television. Is it okay? So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it  to have very powerful and easy. And also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product  such as the colour and s the slogan. I mean that's uh if uh you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s it's our product. So you will have to use the colour of the product  of the um um of the uh of real reaction and uh also Yeah. As we say  we put the fashion in electronics  so it has to be a fashion remote control. Fancy  fashion  powerful  easy to use. Require lot of requirements  but Yeah. Yeah. But uh that's your your job to find something mm matches. Maybe not  but mayb So. So everybody is okay with the new requirements? I think it has to be yellow. Yeah. Maybe you can change the colour  but the image of the society has to be recognised. Why you go It has to be fashion. So you have to Yeah. It has to be a fashion and really be uh the image of the society. Just when you enter you say oh  oh  it's real reaction. Think it's a re reaction remote control  so. And also it has to be attractive  of course  because if you want to sale to sell the remote control. It's okay? Yeah. Yeah. I think it would be simpler. Okay. So I will close the meeting  um just after that we'll have lunch break. And you will have in thirty minutes individual work. Uh Y you You will have as the I_D_ I don't remember what is industr Industrial Designer to put um pon yeah  and the User Interface Designer to work on the user interface concept. And Florent to work my subject. And so specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach. It's okay? I think the um session is closed. And by the way  Mister David Jordan  please record your presentations in your own folder. Not in mine. Should be better. Okay. Okay. No no no. One. I I think I'm a. In one. It's mine. Mm yeah. Okay. Okay  so. The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote T_V_ control. Uh I I will focus on user interface design. Um so move to the next slide. As we know our remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very has very soph sophisticated functions  as we show from this picture. There's a lot of functions. Over  I think over s twelve or twenty s functions of a remote T_V_ control. So how can we um design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions? Um  let's move to next slide. Um. Yeah. So I so we want to design uh elegant  easy to use inter interface. A very good example is Google. As we know uh Google it's a very successful because his um powerful function  but with very easy to use user interface. Um so move to next s slide. So my job is to uh design a Google T_V_ controller which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface. So That's the end of the talk the end of the presentation. Uh With sophisticated functions  but with very yeah powerful. Yes. Yep. Yeah. But if we have very very good user interface it take less time for user to learn how to use it. Yeah  that's my job. That's my job. It's not the easiest I've got to. Yep. Powerful and easy to use. Yeah  that's the point. So what  the wireless remote control? There's a wire with remote control? Okay. Okay. Okay. Wireless remote control. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Design a wireless remote control. Yeah. Functions. Yeah. Yeah  I think possible. Because we can We can uh mix uh several function in one button. So lets you then you have less buttons. But I'm not sure No you you can have a switch menu  so you can well for example Yeah  I think so. Like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes. Then for um you can have a switch menu  so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions. Then you you put the switch button  then it switch to another category of functions. Yeah. For example  if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ and also you can control your uh recorder. So there's a different functions  but i if you you there's a button you can switch between control T_V_ and control your recorder. So we can has less buttons. But what I'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny look fancy  not funny. Because different people have a different opinion about fancy. You know. Because maybe a colourful is fancy for some people  but maybe simple and uh uniform colourful is fancy for some for other peoples  so. Yeah  personalised colour. Because you know Yeah  because maybe some people prefer a red remote control  some people prefer black remote control. Maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options  so user can select which colour they prefer  so. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Control. Mm-hmm. Mm. Okay. But there's balance between function and the cost. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hm. Okay. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And cheap. A low cost. Yeah  there's that box in uh o of it. A pi There's that box in the T_V_  so with the set box you you can connect internet with your T_V_. Ok It's It's not so uh popular now. Mm. Global  okay. So I I so As as for the colour  what what do you think? Yellow? T_V_ remote control? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay  okay. Okay. Mm. Okay. Okay. Okay. ,The Project Manager reviewed the minutes from the previous meeting. The Marketing Expert gave a trendwatching report. He found that a fancy look and feel was most important for users. He also discussed the trend towards spongy materials. The group discussed the cost of adding speech recognition  the LCD screen  and the advanced chip. The User Interface Designer discussed the look of the interface with the group. They discussed the placement and design of the buttons and decided to use scroll wheels for volume. The Industrial Designer advised that flashy colors and rounded shapes be used. The group discussed how to incorporate the logo and including changeable faces. They discussed materials for the buttons and the backlight. The group decided to use rechargeable batteries and a stand  to use plastic for the casing and buttons  and to not include an LCD screen. The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer were instructed to draw the prototype at the next meeting  and the User Interface Designer was instructed to finalize the button placement. The group finalized the look of the product  and eventually decided to incorporate speech recognition and an advanced chip. 
Me too. Okay. Um here's the agenda for our last meeting. Um after the opening we're going to have a prototype presentation  then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote. Then we're going to evaluate the product and I think the whole production process  and then we're gonna close it up  and we have forty minutes  so let's get started. Oh  no  let's have the prototype presentation. Right. Hmm. Yeah. Great. Okay. Okay. And did you determine um the curvature of the bottom part of it for the hand  is it gonna be a single or a double? Single. Single sounds good  'cause it's not big enough to really constitute a double. Great. Great. I think you did an awesome job. It is beautiful  and it's everything that we discussed. Good job. Alright what's next in our agenda? Um we're gonna discuss the evaluation criteria  and that's with Courtney. Right. Mm. Right. Sqi Right. Right. 'Kay. I'll wait. Are we going to indi I say we individually rate what do you say? Just orally. Why not? We have okay. Um easy to use. I vote six. Oh  two. Uh hello  we're great. Um one. No. Me too  very chic. One  I give it a one. Oh  and ma it's a prototype  right. Well  now I'm. So  the average is about a two. Two or three. Two point five. Imagine  since we obviously don't have that. And it's i it is very ergonomically designed. It's gonna be curved. Yeah. I think so too. 'Kay. Two. Alright  average is two. Is it technologically innovative? Oh sorry I'm taking over your job here. Go right ahead. Yes. Right? We were able to do it with that kind of chip. Yeah  right. That was 'kay. And we discussed that being included. Well we don' have the you know  we can't say channel  and it changes the channel  channel eight. Right. Okay. Yeah. I'd go for a three or four on that one  so okay  let's go for a three point five. Alright  and the last criteria is it is it um Well  we've covered that with the trendy. Sure. Capable. Very capable. And it's very important. 'Kay  there we go. So. Next. It does. Very good. Alright  let's go back to this No  that's it. Hmm. Oops. Okay  so now uh we're moving on to finance  okay. I'm gonna show you an Excel spreadsheet and we're going to fill it in together based on what components we're including in our remote and see if it's under twelve fifty Euro. If so  we can proceed  if not  we need to go back to the drawing board a little bit. 'Kay? So let me bring that up. Here we go. Alright. Um it's not hand dynamo  it's powered by battery  so we give it a Number of components you plan to use. Do I just put quantity being one battery  or Yeah. But if it's a do you wanna go for this is where we need to make a final call on if it's a lithium or do we wanna go triple A_s  'cause triple A_s we're gonna have t do more than one battery. Oh  let's just go for a lithium. What do you say? I think uh I think the people who purchase this are gonna be technologically right. Okay  down to the electronics um section. We're gonna need this kind  correct  if we do the voice sensor  so one of those. It is a single-curved  so one of those. Oh. What's that? Yeah  that's correct. 'Kay  down here  case material. Plastic. 'Kay. Down here  interface type. We're gonna have the integrated scroll scroll wheel. Isn't oh those are just regular buttons. This? Okay  so we can just go um. Right I think she's I think what Courtney's talking about is do we need to put two here? Right. I don't know  they might put us well  let's just. Two or would it be three? Okay and we're gonna button supplements the buttons are no uh okay. Are they? Oh  right. Mm. Well  we're under cost then. Alright. No  we're under. Twelve point five is our limit. We've got eleven point two. Alright. We can go to I dunno what I just did. Okay. Now we're gonna talk about the project process um and whether or not we're satisfied with the whole process and the result. Um did we have a lot of room for creativity? Did we have a lot of room for individual leadership  um teamwork  and the means  meaning the technology that we used to produce our little guy there  and if we found any new ideas. Now  question is  how do we do this? Discuss  sure. Alright. Who want who would like to go first? Hmm. Hmm. And how did you feel about the whole the whole process though? Right  and we got say over what how technologically advanced it should be and also how fashionable  which I kind of like we yep. You know it. Um what about um the teamwork aspect? How did you guys enjoy making the model  the prototype? I think ya' did. Did you work well together in there  and 'kay. Oh my God  and we've all been a pretty congenial team here  I think. We hadn't had any ma fallings out. Irritating. Okay. Yeah. I have to knock that one down a couple notches. Yeah  digital pens. They were fine. Right  laptops are extremely handy  wireless. And that we have a shared network where we can put all of the Big brother. 'Kay  have we found any new ideas through this process? For something that looks cool and also has what I want it to b do technologically. And that's your right brain taking over  w wanting the artistic  the fashionable  the hip  you know. If we all just went out and bought useful things  I don't think I mean that's not what technology. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Just the Mac font bothers me even. But I do like iPods  go figure. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Colours. Exactly. I mean how many people went out and bough a Nokia phone  back when we were like in high school  just so they could get the changeable face plates. Okay. Anyway  so that is definitely at work. Yeah. Fashionable chic people will. Hmm. There you go  marketing. Alright. Okay  we're gonna wrap this up now. Um the costs are within the budget  we evaluated the project  and now we're gonna complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary  and then we're going to have a big giant party  apparently  according to this  so. Alright  thank you team  you did a great job  it was lovely working with you. I wanna find our if our remote works. Oh. Whoohoo. That's nice. Good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  I think it's a beautiful Yeah. Good job  you guys. Those are really good. Okay  it's a PowerPoint presentation. I don't really know exactly what we should uh talk about. It's under evaluation. Alright. Um so these are the criteria we're gonna ask  is it easy to use  is it fashionable uh yeah  I guess we should write these down so we can reference them. Like does it feel good  like yeah  physically. That's just for current trend. It doesn't really count  you guys. Yeah. But it's so we do have removable covers  right? Yeah  well then that's covered. And so we n k everybody have that? Yeah  she's got it. It's good. Yeah. Okay so  we're using the criteria uh for a seven point scale  and so we need to discuss how we feel. It falls within this range  so for easy to use  do we feel it's very easy to use? You guys Okay. Oh wait  that's false. Okay. Two. That's what I say. Okay  fashionable? No. I mean like no  I think it's very fashionable. I thi I would give it a one. Well  that's that's just like that's a clay  it's a prototype. What do you think? Okay. Yeah  it's a two. That's okay. Yeah. Um does it feel good? I feel like I think it feels good. I'll give it a two. What do you say? Okay. Oh no  it's fine  you're I mean you're Project Manager. Um yeah  I mean and it does it have voice I mean the phrase recognition on it? And there's no way you can represent it on here. Y Yeah  so. Then yes  then I would well it isn't what else would it need for it to be technologically innovative? And it doesn't cover anything other then T_V_  so I'd probably give it a three. Even though it is for just a T_V_ remote it's uh very advanced. But it is just a T_V_ remote. Well yeah  so I'd give it a two. Oh  it's very capable of being squishy and fruity. Yeah. Okay  next. So um our re model slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie appears to be a winner  and uh hopefully we'll sell millions. Good job  team. What? It it does. Thanks. Two. Yeah. Yeah  let's let's do a lithium. We're gon that's gon Nologically advanced  yeah. Yeah. Uh. Yeah. We plastic. And special colour. But it's Yeah  but i so i But will we w actually we'll need two  won't we? One for the top and then one for the s one e for each side. Okay. Like because there's like one interface right here and then because it's not gonna be on the same plane when you press the button. There's gonna have to be additional signals on the sides. So is that gonna be an extra one on each side? Or three  because of one on each side and one on top. I mean it's fine 'cause it comes out the same as twenty nine. Well less than twenty nine even. They're a special colour. Um they're uh they're a special form  'cause they're indented. And  they're a special material. We're under. I think we just discuss it. Oh that's true. Yeah. No  yeah  that's a good point. 'Cause I'd forgotten that that wasn't our decision  yeah. Oh  overall I mean I thought we did a good job like We got to choose basically we had control over minus it being just merely a T_V_ remote we got to choose what we wanted to do with it. And we're a fashion forward technology company. Minus that one fight. Yeah. Yeah. I mean minus you guys being wha what is it  the survey  annoying or what is it? Irritating  yeah. Wow that's a it's definitely a strong one. Yeah. Yeah  and no internet. And the digital the digital pens were they were pretty cool. Yeah they were fun  even though I'm not really sure what I could do with them  but they are awesome. Yeah. And these things whoa. Yeah. And Big Brother. Yeah. Um we are really gonna sell this. Ta-da. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah  'cause they're pretty and just like Uh yeah. Yeah  no  iPods They want all those words for presentation  even the plugs. Oh yeah  everybody. Mine is amber. Oh. Look at it. That is a piece of work. Wow. Marketing Director says yeah. Fashionable people will buy it. Oh  I will create desire. We could have like an Adam and Eve type commercial  and that's the fig-leaf. Mm. That'll sell. Yeah. Yeah. You too. Um sure. You or me? Okay. Well  since our materials aren't exactly what we were going for  I'm just gonna translate what this all means for you. The base is gonna be gunmetal gray  which is what we had decided  and it's gonna be plastic. Um then there's the latex cover  which is what you see as red. Um because it can be replaceable  we just kinda went with the colour. Um and then the buttons are actually kind of poking through rather than on top. Um and the buttons will be a l much lighter blue  almost see-through. It's just sort of a very pale blue and a light-up yellow. The whole thing lights up if you press any button  rather than it just that one button will light up. Um and then at the bottom we have our logo. Um bright yellow sort of design with the R_R_ which will actually look like our logo. And then on the side you have the buttons. They're one button  but they kind of push up and down. I don't think they're scrolling. Right  yeah. And then yeah  the buttons. Thumb-shaped. Yeah. And then the last thing is just that it'll be black labelling on top  just which we didn't do. Single. Right. Oh thank you. Feel good meaning what? Physically  okay. Yeah. True or false  easy to use. Yeah. Yeah  two. Mm I don't think it's that fashionable. I'd give it like three or four. But then I'm not fashionable  so don't use my opinion. Does it feel good? Yeah  it's gonna be thicker. Depth. I'll give it a one. Oh right  the Right. Yeah I go four. Squishy and fruity. It's just trendy  basically. Okay. It's plastic. And special colour. No  we don't have the scroll. Buttons. Oh like the twenty nine means like you have both scrolls and push-buttons. But we don't have any scrolls. Two interfaces  is that what w should we s say? Okay  fine. Yeah. And then s yeah. We're over? Okay. Oh  I see. We didn't have a whiteboard. Yeah. And no internet. I think we did well. Yep. Gouges. Irritating. And no internet. Misses. I do. There's so much available. Like it's information Yeah. Yeah. Well  that's why I don't like uh Macs or Apples  just 'cause I look at it  and I know it's probably a very good computer  but I look at it  and I'm taken back to elementary school  'cause they look the same. They look like they did when I was in elementary school  and that's so old-fashioned to me. Exactly  so I associate them with like really low-tech  really cheap  bad Yeah. But the my but my one issue is just like the whole it's for T_V_ only. I was like who's gonna buy a remote just for the T_V_ unless they've lost theirs. You're kidding. No  no. No  marketing has to actually create the desire for it. Ri They'll be sexy with it. Oh right. Let you loose. Yeah  no. Good. Mm 'kay  you ready? Y you read that stuff  since you wrote it. I'll be the Vanna. No. They're just buttons. On off switch will be here and as you've noticed on our prototype um they've ended up with a curvature kind of  by concave sort of thing  except for  you know  can't see underneath. So I'm hoping that when we get to production we can actually make them like that  because they're very nice to stock you know  stick your finger in. Um the two squared buttons are are two probably least used  menu  mute  and then these are the numbers  so our channel and our volume will be on either side. I'd say a single. Yeah  it's only actually the size of my hand. Whoohoo. Yeah  it was a little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it. Yes. I'd say two as well. At the moment  no. Okay. I'll give it a two  because at the moment it's not looking that way. Neither are all o all the customers we have  either. Uh the shape of it actually does uh. I'd say a two. We could do it with the chip  yes. It wasn't we have no reflection of it on the prototype  but that's because it's only two dimensions  really. It Yeah. Three and an half. It's capable of being squishy and fruity. How did you get that in there? The slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie. That was good. Yep. Mm 'kay. Yeah  it's. Yep. Well  that's the push-button too  right there. Integrated scroll-wheel or push-button. We're really having just push-button interface. But it that just covers the type of button we're having. Because we're not doing a scroll on the side  it's still push-button. Push-button. But we just have push Yeah. Okay. Let's call it th Okay. Grand. So we can go to production. Go back. Previous. We think we got stifled for cri creativity by the company itself  in restricting us only to using a T_V_ remote  initially. right. Yeah. Well  no  there was there was scratching and fighting  but no. Irritating. The means  the whiteboard didn't work. A and our friend here really feels strongly about the internet. I really appreciated those  yeah. The use of the laptops for receiving everything. It was wireless too  so. And let's not forget the sexy dual microphones everyone gets to wear. The Toronto district school would only use his Macs with their kids. Well  i iPods are now quite trendy  and they come in different colours. Yeah. Not me. I didn't have a phone 'til university. That's okay. We can create a commercial where they think that all their needs will be met. This will help them find the one. That's right. And so the serpent says  use our remote. Whoohoo. Margaritas for everyone. Yay. Thanks to the Project Leader. Now we know w ,The Industrial Designer presented the functional components that will appear in the prototype  and discussed with the group the high cost of the wheel sensor and the possibility of incorporating speech recognition. The User Interface Designer presented existing remote controls to help show the interface of the prototype. He showed how the new design will be more simple and ergonomic than the models he displayed by eliminating extra functions. The Marketing Expert presented news about trends in fashion and in the market that will be incorporated into the design. A fruit and vegetable theme and spongy materials are popular trends that will be used in the design. The group finalized which features they wanted to integrate into the design. They decided to make the remote shaped like a banana and spongy  to have the buttons lighted  to have a wheel sensor at the top of the device  and to use only a standard chip and battery that would not accomodate speech recognition. The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to construct the prototype  and announced that the prototype would be evaluated in the next meeting. 
Hello. Um  Project Manager  I have something to tell you. I have a little problems with my laptop. And uh s s s so I had a little less time to complete. No  a little problem  uh big problem. I just thought Um  it didn't work anymore. The entire Windows uh It it hung. During lunch  yeah. He's the master  yeah. Wow. Oh  have you considered the option of using a solar panel? W nah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Th th yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um Yeah. Um  I think you should use kinetic as a back-up. A combination  yeah. Okay. Yeah. Psycho-kinetic. Yeah. Buy a fifty cents battery and uh Well maybe I have something in my presentation to uh to cope with that. Um  isn't possible to make combination with kind of rubber is or bendable remotes where you've got a. Or do you think it Rubber casing  yeah. Yeah. Um  well d Maybe I can ask it right now the question that I have. Uh  is it possible uh of is it necessary to make a touch-screen square? It isn't  I think  yeah? We're We put fashion in electronics  so maybe we can uh Mm yeah. Mm-hmm. Oh  yeah. Okay  I I get it. Okay. That's good. Well  as long a as long as it's it's uh it's firm  and you don't uh it's not bendable or something  I th I think that goes too far. Oh. Okay. It might even bounce back when you drop it on the floor. Okay. Do your thing. Spongeball. It'll float. Tables. Ah. Hey. Twelve fifty uh When your parents are watching some boring program  you can take the remote and do something else. Take it. Ooh. S Mm-hmm. In Okay. Um the interface contents. Well that's a just simple PowerPoint mock-up I want to m make it more as dynamic for you so I'll draw there. But  the main concept is um take one big touch screen. Um  always display the primary buttons clear and visible. Maybe even li like this with uh u uses of a lot of space. And uh make the menu structure changeable. So if you press um system  that's Yeah  well m multiple system options can  maybe five or ten or or one  can fit in. Or maybe even a step further when you want to um t um have some other options that are not programmable with one horizontal button. And um other buttons can may be displayed here if that's necessary. And um well  how do uh do we want to look at uh uh f um Yeah Does a remote look Well  it's you've gotta hold it in one hand. So um the middle like all remotes have to be in a little bit small  so you can put it in inside your hands. And some remotes you can use with your thumb. But I think that's too difficult for this one. So you can make it s a little broader. Yeah. And here? And maybe use your thumb on the on the main buttons. And use your other hands on the menu structure. So here are gonna be the program buttons. One  two  three  four  et cetera. And the the volume control and program control maybe. And  down here  um  I added  this could be one uh big L_C_D_. Um  the menu structure. So you can use it in uh in this way. Um One thing you've gotta keep in mind  keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time. Um  know that if you are changing the menu structure here  um And well  I still believe you should keep displaying the buttons. But if you're programming the colour of the T_V_  do not display twenty other options that are possible. Just keep it as simple as uh as possible. And do not use too many levels. Do not have to select a screen first and then brightness and then colour and un-plus  and um push plus twenty times. But just the um uh just in one button if possible. And um  well  you kn you all know the T_V_ levels. Um  channel one  two. And when you get to n to uh to ten  ye and want to go back  uh well you have a problem. Just m most most modern T_V_s  you you press one zero  and it goes to ten. And else  to one and through after that. So the s a button less. And um  things like teletext  put them in the menu. Things like um um Yeah. Yeah  yeah w Yeah  I I find I must trying to uh tell it. Is uh volume plus and minus? And this is program uh plus and minus. Uh Yes. Or if you're watching Studio Sports on uh on seventeen  and your wife is watching some soap on two Well yes  I think that's a good idea. But um  well m my preference would to be put it in the menu structure. And if you're using that button a lot of times  well of course the menu will still be displayed on the screen. You just don't have to play games uh in-between. But if you're really switching between two channels  you won't have time uh to d use the other options. Um  yeah already already told that. Yeah. That's my conclusion. Well  I agree  just put it in the menu structure somewhere. Um  yeah um system properties  um parental control. Yeah. Mm. Um  w well  yeah. It it has to be fast. You don't want to to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and wait twenty seconds for for uh the log-on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings. Mm-hmm. Why Mm-hmm. You c may use like when there's uh X_P_  uh a simple log-on  d you just push uh one or two or three. And if you push parents  then Yeah. To log in. Yeah. And if you puts a ye Uh-huh. And if you w you push p children  uh you don't have to uh log in  but you can only watch uh children's channels or uh Okay. Well Yeah. Well  maybe um some idea on that. Just make through a remote as it is  but make an option to insert profiles  'cause if my grandad would buy this remote  he wouldn't want to bother with all all the all the uh things to do. Just make it an option in menu  ins install powerful profiles or something. Um  b well  still some question I have about how to incorporate those ones. You're thinking about some channels they uh cannot see  but well  I I when I think  oh yeah  for the f for all the standard channels  and only for maybe after ten o'clock uh in the evening violent films and movies uh will come and uh maybe maybe some some timing uh will be uh needed instead of uh of channels  because if you're watching uh  I don't know  you're in the at day uh  cartoons will come up m on maybe Friday night. I don't know. Yeah  the disadvantage vantage is that someone will has to send all the show-view numbers of the programs that they remotes and edit it all  will have to decide uh That isn't possible. Well  yeah you could say if parental control is only it it'll go from fourteen to sixteen with the page-up then  but Mm-hmm. Yeah  on a separate menu uh option. Yeah  well yeah  I A mail too from management that it's very popular to use voice recon recognition. But I don't think when you're watching T_V_ uh  hearing loud noises from the T_V_  someone screaming one  and you f the channel switches  uh Yeah. Yeah. W you can put it on chip anyway  so uh As long as it's isn't a primary feature of the remote  but uh Optional in But how we do it? Well  I think also it's a good idea  buts very difficult to incorporate. So we should make it too complex. Is t some menu uh function  you choose parental control  and maybe four files will emerge from menu where put it on. But uh how how it's gonna work uh uh will f be a problem. Mm-hmm. Well Ye I I think best would be uh to put it in and make it an menu option. You can put on Yeah. And you can just uh s when you buy it  you can select um personal preference  parental control on  and the password or something. Oh  it's a p Yeah. Well  maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs  where the parent says  you cannot watch channel seven  nine  and ten  and you cannot watch all channels after ten o'clock. And there's just some little uh clock in the remote. No  no  it's very simple. There uh th I h I've seen some of remotes who have a clock in it. So  the remote does doesn't transmit when it's after twelve clock. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Well  that's To put it very blunt  that's not our problem. Just have um the parents buy uh some glue and uh It's not not a part of the remote. You have to f Yeah. Uh  or make it ourselves very diffic Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Oh. Yeah? I'm listening. Um  well What I was thinking about is just a menu structure  when you don't use it is simple. And when you push uh system properties  uh entire list pops up with e ev all kind of f stuff you can program. Som some bench-marker. Oh. Uh  logo. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Well  you can show somebody a logo for point five seconds  they'll still remember it. And it it l linger on every time you see it. Very annoying. Yeah. Yeah  I It's ok For f Oh  for the next meeting  right? Um Stay here and P_. Ah  no new email. Okay. Thank you. Thank you very much. Yeah. Uh-huh. See you. Yeah. Here? Or uh Yeah. If you got a No. So Stupid manager. No. Don't get what's Hey  Project Manager. What was it  problem? The laptop? It hang hung. Ha-ha. Oh. Project Manager. You're our Project Manager. Master. Master of I'm sorry. Okay. Go on. Yeah but when the power gets low  you have to shake it or something? Uh  and uh uh Hmm. Mm yeah. It's too less space. And when the battery doesn't work  I usually shake it too. So Like slamming on it. It's exactly the same. Hmm. But  are you going to draw it? The Yeah. Yeah. Uh  I c I can't imagine. I can't imagine how how how it looks like. Yeah. Design. Mm-hmm. Uh Oh  okay. Okay. Oh  okay. Okay. Well  I think uh we're going to sell tell ten millions of them. So uh I bet a big company in uh Korea or Taiwan  like uh Samsung  can give us uh a big discount on the chips  so U usually  chips are uh aren't more expensive than one dollar. So That that shouldn't be a real issue  I think. Yeah  a combination. Yeah. Like an uh aku uh Acu uh  yeah. Well . Yeah. Combine them. Okay. Of course. Fifty cent. Rubber. Rather hard. Yeah. Well  I think that touch-screens are generally square. But it's the case you put around it that makes the shape. Hmm? Yeah okay  but if you have a square uh L_C_D_ screen  and you put a case around it that has uh like bulbs or that that covers part of the L_C_D_ screen. That That's it's custom customisable and Yeah  me too. Mm yeah. Yeah. Can I uh do my thing? It uh Expert map. Okay uh Last week I went to uh Paris and Milan for some trend-watching. For marketing. Our research and development department and I went to Paris and Milan. In Paris and Milan  we uh asked different people  uh differing in age and in income  uh the amount of money to spend  um what they like in design uh and material nowadays. Findings. Our main audience  uh so that's people below forty  uh prefer the following. At first  the colours of fruit. Very basic colours  like Janus explained. Um  fresh colours  uh green  red  uh strawberry red  uh yellow  banana yellow. Um  considering material  um Yeah. They like spongy material  like yeah a sponge-ball. Like a s soft material. Janus m uh mentioned it also. I think he did some uh some findings himself. You wer you weren't in Paris? Okay. Like this. Like big uh g flashy colours. Fresh. It's nice  I think. Okay  our secondary audience  uh people above forty a forty years in age  they like the dark traditional colours. Uh Yeah  uh materials like wood that No n j just j just a w No  okay  but just just a wooden uh look. Like uh you have those fake uh fake panels on the floor. The that isn't wood anyway  but Okay? But  that's our secondary audience. So  uh we decided to take mm yeah the people below forty. So  that this doesn't apply. 'Kay  the third. Uh  there're some overall thoughts about new remote controls. They have to look fancy. Um  they should be technological in innovative. That means uh there have to be fancy things in. Uh  and easy to use. But that's common. My personal preferences. We have to aim at a mu at the main audience. And uh  therefore use fresh colours. Uh  I'll I'll come to that in a second point. Here  think about removable covers  as seen in mobile telephon telephone market. To customise your own remote control. Like the Nokia uh the removable covers  uh just put a red on it and go to the shop and buy a green one. Uh  a third  material being used uh could well be stuff like rubber. Um  two advantages. Uh  it fits within the current market trends. And uh it adds safety to your remote uh when you drop it. So Uh to come back to your question  I think uh and the people in Milan and Paris also think that uh the rubber should be pretty hard. Like uh seen on regular mobile phones. Actually  they have a lot in common. The phones and the Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah  exactly. Uh  in my second sheet of personal preferences  uh we have to reconsider the speech function uh recognition. Uh  it's very innovative. Innovative. Yeah  like something. You you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies  like speak uh speech recognition and stuff. But  we have to keep the cost in uh in mind  but it Yeah  it it can be uh very expensive. 'Kay  second. Uh  building games like Snake or Tetris to amuse the younger users. Uh  also the link with uh mobile phones. Uh No  but No  okay. But you don't use games when you're d when you're making a telephone call. It's just the same. Yeah. When you're at college. Uh No. You al you also take uh t you take your IPac and go uh play games. Yeah. Yeah. Well  I do that  but Okay  and um And third  I stick with it  the log-in functionality uh with the slogan  take parental control to a new dimension. That's it. Yeah. Uh  what do you think about a back-and-forth come-up uh button? L like in uh internet explorer. Yeah okay  but does it that is for uh going from four to five. But if you go from two to eight  and you want Yeah  and on two. That you can switch switch easy. Yeah it is. Yeah. Mm no. That's it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah but What I see uh How I see it is you put it on the the remote and then you have like a Windows log-on screen with parents  children. Something like that. And w when you want to use the parents uh option  you have to Yeah  ok Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Pu push parents. That then then then you have to uh go to three-digit uh log-in. Like two one three. And it's in. It automatically goes Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm yeah. V violent T_V_. Yeah  of course. Yeah. Yeah  w It just has to be w when it's deliver out of the store  it has to be just simple and plain. But if you want to install it personally uh If I got kids  and I could choose between uh two remote controls. One uh w with parent control and one without  and I would would buy the one with. I th Yeah. Yeah. Yeah but yeah but that isn't possible. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah  and And and you know w uh when you install another device  uh children can still go up to the T_V_  p pop open uh the thing and and and g go to a channel. Yeah  yeah of course. But Yeah. Ah it's Yeah. Yeah  okay. But it's just an an added feature feature. Mm yeah. Yeah  like f voice recognition is too much  I think. But games. It doesn't Yeah. That that doesn't c that doesn't co Yeah  that that doesn't cost a lot of extra resources  I think. Yeah  it's it's in it. But too ma I I think so  but Yeah. To put Yeah  to put it in always. Yeah  but T_V_s aren't capable of sending. Yeah? I thought they were just a able to receive. Yeah  some. But Yeah. Yeah  j just some rules. Yeah  okay. But  on the T_V_ at least my T_V_  is a is a compartment which you can press. And there are buttons uh behind it which you can use  if you d if you don't if you don't have a Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  of course. Yeah. Or j Yeah. Ah I have to uh consult my legal advisor about it. Consensus. Oh. Oh. I I have one thing left. Maybe for uh Jerome. Um  the views. Maybe it's uh handy to build in an expert view and a simple view. Yeah. Like at In the experts view  you have a lot of more buttons. Yeah. Mm yeah  okay. Fairly enough. Yeah. Yeah  wh which buttons you like or not. Yeah. Yeah. Just leave the other numbers away. Okay. Go on. A little chat. Marketing. Management. Yeah  that's my function  to Okay. Go on. How I know a marketing name for our product. R_ th R_ to the third power. R_ three. Real Reaction remote. Mm-hmm? Bling. Yeah. Yeah  okay  but it has to be like a split second  because you have to put in a code also and Yeah. Yeah. That spins around like all the time. It it's just like a uh globe in Internet Explorer. Okay. Who uh Who who gave you the master class? Ronald Betenberg? Okay  thanks. Ah. In the master class. Yeah. Me too. Thank you too  lord. 'Kay guys  lot of success. Hi. Yeah  sure. Okay. Uh  let me see. I think it's this one. Ha. Right. Uh  well  I'll be talking about the components. Uh  what I did was I reviewed previously used items uh by uh two two uh different uh age groups. Uh below forty five and above. And uh I just uh watch what the differences are and I checked uh  well  what what d do we want  and how can we uh d aim a at uh the target group. Well uh what I found was that a senior um senior citizens uh Ye Ah  it's it's okay. Uh They  well  they like more the they like the traditional materials  like wood and and such more. Wood and chrome. And uh uh they like uh straightforward shapes. Um  uh they they they they like luxurious uh styles  where whereas the young and dynamic  they like a more uh soft materials. Think of the Teletubbies  for instance. Uh uh  soft and fluffy and colourful and Well uh  shapes are curved and round. Y y you get the picture. And uh they like sports and gaming  and that gives them uh the vitality. Uh  so w well uh  firs Yes. Yeah. No  I'll I'll get to that. You you'll see. Yeah. Uh  well f first off  let's start start with the energy. W I uh I had a choice between uh a few different uh sources. But uh the two basic sources that I found were the best possible were the battery uh versus kinetic. Uh kinetic  that's when you move something  then uh it gets energy. I figured  well that's ki kinda high-tech  when when you have a remote control that well  when you pick it up  it has power. That would be actually very nice  uh I figured. Well  we could also use a battery  that's a bit Yeah. Yeah yeah  you c just you have to shake it around a little bit. And then then it d then it has some more uh energy. Well  y you could just go for a battery. Or you can go for both? Yeah  I actually did. But uh the thing is about solar panel is you have to have l uh light. Well  sunlight preferably. Uh  and you you could you could use normal light  but uh you wouldn't get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery or something. Uh for uh ultimate b uh n uh use of uh solar panels  you could actually use uh you could use uh solar panels  but uh you ha you'd have to implement them into uh the remote control  leaving you uh a bit less space for the interface. So uh so i i it it wo what's actually I I c just in f I've figured it out that well  uh seeing that you'll always be uh within the l uh distance of T_V_  and the from T_V_ there comes a a a whole bunch of light. So it would actually power itself uh from a T_V_. But  well you just take up all the space  and you wouldn't uh have the full amount of power actually used. So I I prefer kinetic because it's uh well  the costs aren't that much higher  and um  ju just a bit more high-tech than than a normal battery. I mean  if No  but uh d Well  you pick it up and you press buttons and y well  you Yeah  well uh actually it is. And it it if it isn't  you just shake it a bit and and add add with power up again. But  what l what Jarek said  you could you could use a battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves. And for rest  you'd just add juice on the battery. Exactly. And so that Uh Uh well  f furthermore  you you we uh checked uh the cases. We have uh different options uh concerning the cases. You ha I you sim uh you simply add a basic uh standard uh model uh it was kind of square and uh I figured that's a bit boring. So you you we could go for uh the single curved or the double curved. Um  single curve  it's just a well  uh  you know  it's just uh a nice curve. Or but but you could go in a in an double curves. And that's like several different dimensions. That gives you an whole new uh effec Yeah  that gives you a younger and uh more high-tech look  I f I figured. But  that uh we'll discuss later. What? You want me to draw in three-D_? Uh  yeah  I ca I ca I could I could show you. I could show you. Well uh let's say y uh you uh Let's say that's your standard uh That's a bit your d standard design. But you could actually go like uh something like this. And then uh in three-D_ effect you could go So y you you just Yeah  this is a this bit uh difficulty in I didn't take a major in art. So But but you could have uh uh a whole new uh the back back the the the depth  you could you could uh just play around a bit with. You you don't have to use standard uh Yeah you could y It leaves more space for creativity. Uh that might be an idea  but just a Well  furthermore  uh well  uh plastic versus rubber? You We could choose uh what uh what's better  plastic um or rubber. I I ch prefer rubber because it feels uh Yeah. Yeah  it's soft and it's that I like soft. Yeah  yeah I mean uh plastic uh is Plastic also has that cheap feeling to it  like plastic uh Your your I usually associate plastic with uh something that's cheap. Uh that's maybe just me  but Uh  we could uh uh  oh  talk about it later. Uh furthermore  buttons. Uh traditional uh or a touch screen. Well  we discussed it in a previous meeting  so I figured I'll just leave it at the L_C_D_. And uh chip set  well uh if we are going to use traditional buttons  we could go uh with a simple chip set. But uh if we decide to go on a n uh um L_C_D_ screen  we would use an uh we have to use an a advanced chip set. And that would bring uh the necessary costs with with it. So that's something we th have to keep in mind. If it isn't uh manageable uh budget-wise  we'd have to go over to uh to sim to simple buttons. Yeah. Yeah  probably. Yeah  probably  but But uh yeah  that's that's That shouldn't shouldn't be uh that big a issue. I'll I'll I'll just add  uh uh I put a big summary here  so we could discuss it a bit. Uh what i what are your ideas concerning battery versus kinetic? Yeah  you you you should we should A combination. Uh  you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic. When you pick it up  it charges up. Yeah. Yeah yeah  I know. Yeah  I con Exactly. What uh what do you think? You agree? Yeah? Both? Okay. Uh  well that would bring the m m some more costs  but I mean the Who cares  right. That's the Project Manager's problem. Yeah  well Fifty cent uh Uh  why doesn't And then we have single-curved versus double-curved. That Okay. No  we'll we'll just wait and uh Uh  plastic versus rubber. Any ideas? Uh  rubber? You Uh  I figured it will be m rather than hard Nah  rubber c uh this is a casing  yeah. Rubber casing  because well if you use an uh d a touch-screen  uh it's just a casing uh around it. So um  you could go for plastic  but I figured I I I would choose rubber. Well  m I don't know. No. Yeah. That isn't Yeah  that would cover it. That that would solve the problem. So mm Uh uh so uh so what are the opinions? Uh rubber or plastic? I I I prefer rubber. Yeah  you too? You sure? You you you seemed to hesitate a bit. Yeah  it it shouldn't it shouldn't flop over when you hold it in your hand uh No  that that that that's gonna The the chip set will hold it firm in place  and uh and and uh and a L_C_D_ screen also Yeah it m might it might. Uh  tra uh traditional versus L_C_D_  well I figured we we all set on that. And uh  then also the simple versus advanced. Well I figure if we go for L_ L_C_D_  we we should have the advanced. So that shouldn't be a problem. Okay  well that's my uh Uh  you're welcome. Well  the Teletubbies sh Well  you could. You you could. Well uh Yeah. Well  I actually saw a phone that you could use as a remote  so Yeah. Hey. That might be a next step. Well  yeah. You take your uh remote with you to school. Yeah. Very nice. I don't know if it's worth uh the time and effort we are going to spend on it. Because well it's a simple function  but it's gonna take a lot of resources and a lot of time um to programming it. Because you'll have to start working with the profiles and such. And I'm not sure if it's actually worth uh investing that much time and effort into it. I don't know what But  well  if you want to I i i if we in incorporate uh the parental control  uh let's say we do  and and well whatever  cho uh child just goes up to the T_V_ and presses up for instance. Well uh  nob nobody's stopping the child from uh well checking uh the channel. But that Well  I'm not sure because um for that to happen  you d you will have to receive a signal from the uh remote control  so it would  yeah  have to be constant uh constant signalling. What m what may be better is to incorporate an uh a separate device that uh that you can program with the remote control. And that uh provides parental control  for instance. And that's just an optional uh device. So there's n that's there's uh besides uh the remote control  you'll have a separate uh Yeah? Yeah  that's true. That's true  but uh at same instant  same happens when uh you have remote control. So But  only difference is uh the uh the people buying the remote control will now get the f added feature of parental control  and those people wouldn't uh necessary want it. So  you you'd be Yeah. Yeah. I can see games happening. Yeah. Yeah  that will be nice. Well  I don't know. I I figure if you had two different remotes  you could bo choose one with uh well uh uh a receiver in it. So you could actually easily uh build in uh parental control. But it would would be uh more expensive. So  a and that that way uh you could make cheap model and a expensive model. Could ma make the uh simple model and the deluxe model  uh for instance. Yes they are. Yeah. Yeah  you you have some T_V_s any Yeah. That is true  that is true. Well yeah  you could you could easily you could easily you could easily to the mote control. But you still have the problem about uh the television itself. Yeah  yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  that is true. Yeah  that is true. Yeah  you could you could you could go like uh that that would actually make uh things a lot more easy. You could just blame it on television and uh make it their problem. Yeah  I figured I figure we could do that. Yeah  yeah  sure. Uh  I'm not sure what marketing thinks about it  but User profile. Well yeah  you you could actually build in a function that you can program it yourself  for the more advanced users. Yeah  which buttons do you want to in it. Because you can you can like build in a back-forward button  and uh some po somebody would just want to watch two channels. Yeah  you could you could m have people want uh want that. Ah  yeah  sure. Well  if you if you have the l L_C_D_ screen  you can you can uh have a small logo i uh at the bottom. And it could just stay there. Yeah  that spins around or something. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah  something like that. A small icon. So we're going to work together right now? Definitely. Well thank you too. You wish. M Aye? Cheers. Hey. Yeah  uh I'm not sure if we uh we Because I saw something about individual actions. Well  yeah. Right. Uh Do you have new email? Hmm. Hello again. Mm yeah. Okay. Okay. Yes. Yes. Your project manager. Welcome to the conceptual design meeting for Real Reaction. Uh  hello again. Uh it's uh the same as the last time. Uh uh  also this time there will be uh three presentations. And we um must uh reach a decision on uh the remote control concepts. Um uh  and at the end  uh I uh  when I finish it off I have some uh input from uh a master class I uh visited. information. The the the the the concepts on uh we uh where we uh must reach a decision on. Um uh  our from uh are of two sorts. Components concepts and user interface concepts. Uh  the first one is uh really about the the the the the total package uh with uh Well  we have decided to do a do the uh with a touch-screen that must be a case around it so uh it won't be uh uh as breakable. Uh how how about the energy? Can you uh can you reload it or uh just have batteries which you must exchange? Uh  the user interface concept. Uh  with the type and uh the the supplements. So uh where to put what button. And uh uh I would say uh Jans  can you begin? Okay. At the end  uh I will take notes uh and at the end of the minutes uh will uh be at the shared folder. Mm-hmm. One one little question. Um about the the material. Uh a soft material for a remote control? Okay. Yeah. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Oh. But you prefer kinetic? Okay. Yeah  but you don't move a a remote control too much. And that's enough to to keep the energy level uh Okay. Okay. Thank you  Tim. Yeah. Dynamic dynamic look? A little artistic. Okay. It's soft. That's the material the younger people want uh  ain't it? Just like the watch from Seiko. Yeah. I I uh I would prefer uh both uh too. Yeah. Combine them. Rubber. Yeah. Yeah. Mm yeah. Me too. Yeah? Okay. Mm yeah. Thank you. Yeah. Do your thing  Tim. Bring it on. Yeah. Flashy. Yeah. Yeah  but wood is not a not a material you which you build a a remote control of. Yeah but never seen one. Case. Oh  a wooden look  yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Would you prefer uh uh that you can choose the colour of your uh remote control or Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Maybe you could use your remote as a phone. There are numbers on it  so uh So that you say um S_P_S_S_  and it goes to uh Okay. Yeah  but you don't use that th games when you watching television  I think. Yeah  okay. You take your remote control with you. Uh great. Oh  okay. Uh I think we can discuss a little about the the three uh kind of revolutionary things uh Tim uh came with. The parental control  the games  and the voice recognition. Uh There's n not uh too much decision on uh that one so uh I think that parental control is a good function to uh to put in the remote. I don't know how you think about it. Yeah. Yeah. No but I think most people uh find it uh much more important that their children don't watch uh sex or violence uh on the television  and uh wait uh ten or fifteen seconds longer  so they can uh finally watch it uh because of that. Uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well I think that's a b there's a big market for it  because uh you Yeah  you read many times in magazines same kind of stuff  and you heard on the news that uh that he Yeah  they believe that children uh are influenced by the television  and uh Well  we're we're aiming uh to uh below uh forty uh years. But there are a lot of uh people will below forty who have uh children in young age uh who who want um to uh not watch uh violent or uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah. That's a that's a better idea? Yeah. Yeah  okay. Yeah  with and one without. Yeah. Yeah  maybe it can work with show view. Uh  you you can control your video recorder with show view. Uh  when you tick in a number  it will uh start and end uh recording. But maybe there's some option that uh that t uh the kind of show view numbers are violent  and that they are blocked out. Yeah. That's true. Yeah. Yeah. I wouldn't put it in an optional device. That that then then then it becomes too much  I think. If we do it  we we must do it in a kind of ways that like a profile  a parent profile  and a family profile  and otherwise. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And what do you uh guys think of the games in the voice recognition? I personally think that that becomes too much. It's more like it gets you to the functionality  but Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And games? That would Okay. So that will uh that that that must be in it  you think? Okay. So the games uh are in it. The voice recognition are not. And the parental control are optional? Yeah. Okay. Yeah  okay. Uh  but uh will there uh uh Like the first idea uh from uh You can buy it without and uh with parental contr control? Or are we going to put it in and uh just uh Yeah? Mm yeah. Yeah  you yo Yeah  but most often not. Yeah. Okay. So uh I think we have decided on the things that Uh from Janus  the energy  the combination between battery and kinetic. The case will be double-curved and uh rubber  in a fr flashy fruity colour uh that with cover is removable. The buttons will be uh touch-screen. Uh but there may not be too many buttons. And in the the menu structure  uh there must not to be uh Five minutes to go. Uh  too uh too many levels. And uh it must be easy to use. The parental control will be incorporated  but it must be not too complex. And the games are in it. So I think we have uh we have decided uh  okay. Uh  little more. Yeah. Like a like a moat or s or something. Yeah. Yeah  but you have that in the Yeah. You use the Yeah. It's already incorporated a little in that concept. Okay. We take it to the other meeting  okay? I have a little w uh little chat to do and uh then we uh finish. I went to uh a master class and uh uh two things uh are uh are uh can come in handy uh for us. First thing uh is uh we talked about knowledge uh management. Knowledge engineering and uh uh the fact that uh that uh that the idea of knowledge  uh sharing and learning knowledge from other companies is uh like that. It's it's uh very hot at the moment  so it's it's mostly for the management expert to to look what other uh marketing or did I said management? Oh. Just talking about myself. Uh W What other companies uh had to uh also with the the the the marketing campaign when they put on a newer remote  just some uh Yeah. Import export. And uh another one. Uh  they're a ha they're at Yeah  benchmarking  that's the word I saw. I uh couldn't uh Okay  uh another uh thing is uh there were there there was a survey  and um uh it came out that um people like to buy things from a single large provider  instead of those who uh are partnering uh with us. So  we must uh we must bring it as if uh Real Reaction is uh is big company  uh a trustful company  and uh it has m Okay. I had a I had another idea to put uh uh the whole the whole idea of uh Real Reaction and uh uh uh a single brand and uh uh that kind of thing. When you uh put on remote  you see a kind of a just like when you telephone  you see a little uh animation. Real Reaction remote. And uh with the with the with the motto  we put fashion in electronics. And then you go uh The Yeah. But w th the idea from this uh thing is that we must present it as a as we are a a single large provider who will stand on our own. Mm yep  yeah. Also also. But we we are uh Yeah yeah y yeah yeah. Okay  but uh think about that kind of things. That's what they said in the master class.. N Uh  next meeting starts in thirty minutes. So uh maybe you can go to Paris and Milan uh once again. The master class? Franz Mehler's. Uh  very special  uh next uh session. Uh idea that you uh the the industrial uh development uh centre and uh user interface uh will work together on a prototype. And uh will drawing it on the SMARTboard. So that's a kinda new uh thing. And um  the marketing expert will uh will uh ke he will be keeping busy with the product uh evaluation. But the most uh specific instructions will be sent to you by email. Yeah  the well  uh dids this what I uh what I heard. I Not in the master class. So you uh just wait for the specific instructions and uh But I think it was a very uh very good uh session  uh gentlemen. I will thank you all. And uh Give me a good evaluation. Cheers. See you in a half hour. But keep an eye on your uh laptops for a real uh Yeah  but th there's there's still the my uh instructions that you will work together. That's not my problem. Bye-bye. The project manager always works alone. ,The project manager opened the meeting and went over the minutes of the previous meeting. The user interface designer and industrial designer then presented two prototypes of the remote the team is working on and discussed the options for components and materials to include in their design. The first prototype featured a simple design with only a small number of buttons. The second prototype was shaped like a banana and used scroll push button technology. The marketing expert then led the team in conducting a product evaluation of the prototypes in which the prototypes were evaluated on the basis of their fanciness  technological innovation  ease of use  trendiness  and marketability. Overall  the prototypes performed quite well in the evaluation. The project manager then examined the production costs of the remote. The cost to produce the remote was 9.20 pounds and did not exceed the project budget. The team then conducted an evaluation of the project process  in which they indicated that they were quite happy with the tools available to them  the ideas they came up with  and their teamwork. 
Uh we don't have any changes  do we? So no. It's basically what we agreed upon  but just a little bit more specified. Uh s Final design. Basically in what we discussed  cover and buttons will be made of rubber  yellow colour  black components  as you can see right over here. We chose a different type of colour for the menu. A bit darker yellow so that it com really shows in this keypad. If you put them all black  it's not really that good a contrast. So Probab Yeah. That's the be And it I guess it's more easier to just paint it on the rubber than to uh So we have it's a bit round shaped  that's what we had uh We chose the buttons to be uh teletext  okay button  favourite channel and the mute. So that's basically what we chose there. If you have anything to add  please interrupt me. Oh. That's pretty much it. Oh sorry. I'd say that too. Uh we don't really have a extra function with the speech sample  which you can't do with a normal remote control  which people already do. So Well  I'd I tend to disagree with you on that  because the trend issue was a big issue when we started designing this. So can't we just basically extend it to thirteen? Okay. Yeah. We do. We could take out a curve indeed. I think the colour is more important than the really the curve  because if you just end up with an entirely black remote control So black and grey is okay. Which we can fabricate  okay. No  we basically We need to stick to that. But they don't Well And if we So which curve is that ba that's basically that curve. So we could u still have the comfort. I second that. No  that it would turn out to be a pretty straight-forward remote control. So that's not really that I would Yeah. I would say I would agree with you on the colour  because that's an extra option  an extra service we can deliver for a little bit of more money. So we can always do that. Which is basically what we discussed. Yes  we could have Well I hope it sells. Which are basically accessible through the menu button. Yeah. Which is not an option. To make it that way  yeah. Mm yeah. And it's pretty straight-forward  you have a navigation no keys to navigate through the L_C_D_ menus. So One I d no  actu No  it it is pretty straight-forward. Yeah. Yeah. Well  basically the menu options indeed. But No. Yeah. Yeah. Two or three. So You can seven. Or we could say it Or we could say neutral  we 'cause we scratched the C No  we don't have the colour. So I Yes  but the end product So Maybe we should go with a two then  because it's not perfect  because we can't do it initially  but we Yeah. Overall score. Ten  sixteen  divided by Is two two third. There's Yeah  if we make it into a four  as in neutral  because we didn't implement it  so we can't say that we that it's really not well implemented. We come out on a average of two one eighth. So which is pretty w good. It's at least on the positive side. So We could definitely have done better if we've had more resources  but Yeah. True. So did you Yeah. And we could share information which we received. Yeah. Although for actual design I'd say the response time should be a little bit higher  because The digital pen was definitely better to draw my ideas and to further elaborate on that. So Oh can you? Okay. Yeah  well it could also possibly be well  is it a more real-time information base  so we can all see which information is available to one another. Well  I personally did not have that  but That's probably your l description. But I also didn't not really. But still  you had that as well. Is that we finished up the design and then we checked the website  and then there was just extra information. There was a little delay in the bit of a c crucial delay. How much time do we have for this anyway? Yeah. Champagne. Product name. The bana 'cause it's not yellow anymore. Well  uh I was going for the R_C_ deluxe  but it's not really a catchy name or anything  it's more Something with our company name  can we do anything with that? Maybe there's something on the website which will help us out. The reaction deluxe. Is that a name or a c campaign? Yeah. Or the The real reactor. You should write it down as a an option. So that's one option. Should I write the banana down or Sure? Well I Uh do you mean it like You mean it like this? Dash C_? Like a C_ right now or a dash in a C_? Is it triple R_C_s? No. Well  that's another option. Okay  so which ones are we going to scratch definitely? I say this one as well. Triple R_? Triple R_ it is. Yeah  sure. I don't really know whether we can save it as a picture or no. Sure. Network places. I wouldn't pick that one  no. Sure. Oh. I see you later. I think it's more or less the same as we had. No much s No no no  not at all. Hmm. Yeah  of course. That's uh the integration story again. No  uh this is just a description of what we see there. So Speaks for itself. Hmm. I d Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Huh. Okay  but there's another problem. But there's another problem. If we take another cover  for instance black  then we also need another button frame  'cause black and black doesn't work obviously. Huh. Huh. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Right. I agree. Mm-hmm. Or say let's lose rubber  take plastic. Yes. Although we are demolishing a little bit the style. But Yeah. Can we then not also uh change the material? We take plastic for the basic cover and We can put those to the to the other covers. That's true. But okay. But what do you then suggest we'd lose? Because we have to lose two things and I guess. Yes. Okay  and that's enough? Hmm. Hmm. Perhaps we should make m Huh. Perhaps we should make clear to our customer that we had to do this to stay under the cost. And that's uh they know that this is an option and that we had to drop the option to stay under the cost  that they know that. Perhaps they decide tha Of course. Perhaps they uh no  but perhaps they think uh okay  the cover is such a nice idea  uh let's that that then they uh that allow us to make some more costs. We ca we uh we can at least tell them that You don't know that. Huh. No  I'm not uh talking about that cost but the one that g has given us the order to design this. We could at least m uh make it like this  like you said  and then tell them okay  we had to drop this and that  just that you know. It is an still an option  but not for this price. Exactly  but Hmm. I'd say lose the curve and the colour and Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Oh. I agree. No. Hmm? Yes. Huh. Hmm. Me too  I felt a bit blind throughout the project  because in the beginning I had no list of available materials  and then I d had not list of available c finances. So Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. One. Hmm. Manual. I think the L_C_D_ display could be a little bit more difficult then a normal remote control  but then again  it's for young people. So Yeah  I th Exactly. No  that's true. I think it won't be a big problem. Ah. Um With the more important functions on. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. the menus uh Things like brightness and uh those kind of things we've put in the menu  because we have no buttons for those. Yes. Mm. Yes. Nah  it's not really only an extra. No menus. Think about Hmm. But M Changing covers is also trend that we followed. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Six. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm  of course. Mm-hmm. But I think for this price  this is it's really a reasonable product. It's a good product. Oh. Oh. Yeah. But if pep people really want speech recognition  then they must be prepared to pu to pay more  because it's cannot be done for this. Hmm yeah. Ah but for this price uh you cannot ask that. You cannot th think of that No  it's not. Mm-hmm. Oh It's also more attractive. Hmm. Yes. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Huh. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. That's the same thing that I had in the beginning. Everybody was using materials that s I didn't have. So Oh. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. But there's uh also one problem with this I noticed. Uh you have to finish a page before going to a n Oh. Okay  I saw that uh Hmm. Yeah  but I made Okay  but I made three pages and they were not finished. And when the third one was finished  I wanted to download it and then it was not possible anymore  because you have to close all the pinnits uh the pages before going further. Exactly. So we cannot work on more than one page at same time. That's not possible. You have to finish it completely  then download it  it's then start a new one. That's not very uh handy  but if you know that  then it's not a problem. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Ah. Well Hmm. Huh. Yeah.. Yeah  Mm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. No.. Okay  bring out the beer. I have no more email. My coach is uh being very silent now. No  we haven't think above about that. Huh. It's better than thi I think than a serial number. Sony uh T_R_ something uh f means nothing to me. Uh Like fruit names. Uh at least it's not something with numbers. Numbers are so meaningless to the people. I mean. Real Reaction. Real react. The Real Reactor  I don't find that uh that bad at all. Yeah. Because our name is Real Reaction. I'm looking for things in the name. So that the first three letters are s the same. R_E_A_ R_E_A_. The triple R_. Real Reaction remotes control. Triple R_.? yeah. Yeah  that.. I think triple R_. Doesn't sound? Yeah. Ah. I think I like it like this more. Hmm. Mm. I would huh. I would lose the C_ and just name it triple R_. It sounds like uh thinking about two different things and combining it. I would just say triple R_s triple R_ That's also short  catchy. Banana.. Yes. did you do now? Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Mm-hmm. The boss is always the last one to go home. So See you in a minute. Okay. Can't we take this one? Otherwise we have to do it all over again. Is it okay if I try? Is that okay with you? I'll put it back in a minute. Okay  it has been saving something  but where to I don't know. Oh  can I say exp yes  I can. Export as J_ PEG.. Okay  can I not put this wherever I wants. My document is the wrong one  huh. I cannot. I don't think so. Document and settings. That's a pity. That means that we have to gonna draw it again. Are you gonna do that? Okay. That Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yes  that's correct. Okay. No. Oh  it's export. Okay. Oh  of course. Sorry. Hmm. Hmm? Mm yeah. Okay. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Pushbut Special colour  yeah. Yeah  it The p And the p What. But uh the and Yeah. The people Spongy  yeah. Yeah. And But But The people want to pay for for it  so why why uh do we have to keep us uh uh um on the twelve and a half? Yeah. But we can take a risk. Okay  yeah. I hope the people will like it  but Yeah. Yeah. The first sheet. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  that's better. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. And I want to do that. Yeah. Yeah. But Let's um see um Um Let's Uh Oh. Hmm. Okay  let's eval evaluate uh the product of us  our design. Um I have some uh a method  a requirements and scale of. I uh will pre present uh some statements and we will decided together wha what if it's true or false and uh then we see uh if the requirements of the user are fulfilled or not. And I will uh make a new blank sheet. So so the buttons  the look and feel. I thought it was okay  but the advanced uh settings  um screen  audio and channel We are not Oh the menu button is it. Hi Oh  okay. Then it's all uh S it's true. Yeah. So d Oh wait. Uh pen. The p Oh yeah  it's red  okay  but Look and feel is everybo it's true. So Anyone? And the next one uh yeah  when it's lost uh you can find it. It's Yeah. And it's and it's yeah. To. That's okay then. And the next one. How is that? Uh w we had we don't have an uh manual  yeah. But I think that's a part of it. But Yeah  an L_C_D_  it tells a lot about uh Yeah. So it's a one or a I don't know. For the advanced uh settings. No okay  that uh that's true. Oh  so it Takes no ti Yeah. And the L_C_D_  you have to see it. Um mm Oh  it's a little bit learning. Okay. Uh yeah it's uh a little bit same. But it tells you or not? But wha w oh  yeah. What are we uh displaying on the L_C_D_ screen? Just uh only the channels and or What uh? Oh  in the L_C_D_ screen. And for a channel selection  uh or that's not Yeah  I thought I thought too but yeah. But Maybe a T_V_ guide or something in your L_C_D_ uh Yeah. Yeah  it must be clear then what what what for we use it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  indeed. So everybody's agree with an uh three on it  it's W Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  I A three. Ah  nothing  that's A seven. Uh that's uh Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Not with the speech recognition. Uh yeah  all the trends and no colours uh anymore. So Yeah  uh um only in the curves. But the colours  we don't have special colours on it. Yeah  but we yeah  we don't have it  so d In the end product. Now But it's not a one. Yeah. Oh. Oh well Oops. Oh it's a two  right? On the last one. Uh that n that's all. Overall. It's um ten  sixteen three uh two two point seven or something like that. I don't know why. Six. Um So we can say it's it's the product is it's okay. Y not Yeah. Woah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  with. The scale. Yeah. With an L_C_D_ screen. Yeah  you can make 'em another one. Yeah. Yeah. Favourite channel. Yeah  I know. Yeah. Yeah  you're working separate. Yeah. Yeah  yeah yeah. Yeah yeah yeah. Direct uh communication with yeah. Yeah. My handwriting is little bit yeah. Yeah. But th that's Yeah  okay. No. You can Done and then it's okay. Oh  okay. Okay  yeah. Okay. Oh. Hmm. Important to mm Yeah. Mm Yeah  after After five minutes  uh Yeah. Email uh it's Yeah. I want one for my own. Yeah. Yeah  my personal coach i What Yeah  name. Or fruit name. Fruit name or something like that. The banana remote or something. I don't know. Yeah  it's the form of it. Yeah oh  yeah. Uh yeah. Uh Yeah. That's true. Reaction  Real Reaction... Zapping. The Yeah  sure. The banana. Remote. Banana recei R_C_. Remote. R_ three C_. R_ three C_. Real Reaction Remote Control. R_ three C_. Oh yeah.

Yeah  but I don't know. Smart no. Ma it's maybe it's not on the network of uh the rest. That one is.. Yeah. Okay. Oh yeah . Can I see scores? Uh  one one  two threes  two Okay  then we'll overall  two points. Yes. Yeah. Mm. Can I close this? Oh  okay. There we go. Okay  here we are again. Detailed design oh  come on. Well Ah s Forgot to insert the minutes  but it's about the same thing we discussed before. Uh Could open that anyway  think. Other design anyway  we took as we took w we took rubber as as the material last time. We also that you're just busy with it. Took the advanced chip to t uh implement the advanced features. Well  we discussed the design  no sharp corners  we rounded it off  like you see on the other screen  which is fine. Um we agreed that the colour should be b uh yellow and black. Yellow in the back because it's m trendy  more trendy than black anyway. So then we ca yeah. We agreed that we would implement both the L_C_D_ and speech recognition  but I'll get to that in a moment. 'Cause some changes in the finances have left us implications anyway. So so  like I said  we had no insight in finances  no prices  but we have 'em now  and it's bad. Anyway. We are Oh. Prototype presentation  well first you guys built the prototype. So you could could present that. But um let's see what be handy to do. Nee no  you just go ahead and present the w we'll scrap it later because What? Oh that's hasn't changed that much  huh? I didn't expect anyway. You just coloured it. Mm-hmm. I like the menu. Mm-hmm. And I suppose the the the yellow is not printed on the on the rubber. It's it's part of the rubber  I suppose. I think that's more I think that's more durable anyway than printed on to Oh yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Now it's my time to ruin everything. Well  not ruin everything  but no  nah. Finances  that's what we have here  what you drew. We have battery power  we have advanced chips and the sam the sensor. The sample sensor and uh for speak recognition anyway. So which you see the which is de o one of the most expensive parts. So well  we have sin one curve  a design. Rubber design. And we had a special colour. Suppose yellow is a special colour. So just half a Euro for You have pushbuttons and an L_C_D_ display. You have the total of seventeen Euros in production cost  which is higher than the twelve and a half that we are permitted to use. So  easy. What do we scrap. Well think I had the best solution that I came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition. Because the L_C_D_ has more support on customer side. There are ninety one percent of uh the people  or something like that. But ninety percent who favour an L_C_D_ display  and only sixty percent that favour speech recognition. I think it's also harder to. So I ju I took that out. So and so it's still stuck with thirteen  so I had to take out the special colour I suppose. And  yeah  I didn't see anything else I could take out. Yeah  I could take out the push-buttons  but we need those. So  generally what I came up with  in order to be cou to to have production cost of twelve and a half Euros  spe scrap speech recognition and the separate covers can account for the if people want it  we'll just then we'll do it in black. We'll just deliver it in black  have the it has all the function that it's supposed to have  and if you want it if you want the custom design  then you can buy the separate covers. You make it d orange or whatever you want. It was a big issue  but I'll just go back. Uh let's just let's see what okay  let's just see what we no  we we have to be under twelve and a half. It it's not uh the project is a no-go if we go over twelve and a half  so. I think you that's what you were ass assigned to do really  to to see how b th both those work together. So I think yeah  it's I think it's y one of the it's a good way to um to help people uh to make to keep the product trendy too. Just keep you just make new covers for the for it  like we agreed before. And everything that's left is is the basic function that uh that we want our product to have. Because the expensive parts are in either the advanced chip. But we need that for the L_C_D_ display. Then again  we have the L_C_D_ display  which is also expensive. B yeah  but those go together. And yeah  we could take out the curve. Could we could take out the curve. Is that an option? For you? Yeah. I think it's it it does ruin it  but the fact that I t took that decision or t Took this example actually  not really decision  but the example is because we do offer the um the possibility of adding your own custom covers. So you can change any colour you want. So it's just you deliver a basic remote control with a possibility to change you into whatever you want. You can take plastic  but I d it's something that's stuck into my mind is that something that really came forward from the marketing research is that people like the the the the squishy feeling of the spongy feeling of the and it really makes it also makes it different from the existing remote controls  because they're all plastic. So which in in turn Rubber would increase durability because it doesn't break. I al like I said  I lost the speech recognition and I lost the special colour  which would make this black a black and grey. Yeah  that's that that that's enough  because I guess those are the basic colours. So Oh. I think those are basic col They want to To ensure the profit. That that's th that's the order. We're just uh we're the project team and we got our our orders from the pro from the boss of our company which say we don't wanna spend more than twelve fifty for this. But that's not for our that's not our decision to take. We have a budget of twelve fifty per product. So Stick that. I don't think it's really bad either. I mean if we we have the the backup of or the backup design thing to have I think they would do. Th I think they do like because yo we you we agree upon that the that the the the cover thing was a nice idea  because p you could have all sort of designs while at the same time just manufacturing one product  one basic product which you could turn into any any taste you want. So I think it's the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect and keep the functionality between of within the th the boundaries of the your f uh your budget. So Well I don't think Yeah. Is it worth is it is it does it mean anything to the customer? Like  it like  we don't care we don't care that you had to True  but we did we didn't get that. So I think it's it should either be a pack  maybe we sh that should be sold in in the s in stores with with a standard cover or something. But They could  but uh It's an option  but yeah  it's true. So actually uh it's not that much of an increase  but yeah. We cannot contact them. It's just the order that we got. So that's what we gotta go with. So it's either one fi just just to get it f just to get it through final  it's either turned into plastic  drop the squishy feel  make it make it more breakable  um or turn it yellow. So It's uh something we have to decide on. I say lose the curve. Oh that's true  we could lose the c yeah  I forgot that  sorry. Uh the curve. So That's just this one just d this is the banana curve. So this would this would be straight. No  uh no  that would be a curve inside the thing  I guess. No  would ju then it would just be a straight remote. Just like like that. Which would  yeah  turn it into something far more ordinary. we could make it yellow then  but You second that  you second that we lose the curve. Okay  yeah. So I think it would be a good idea to keep the curve to separate it from the rest of the remote control world  so to speak. So we keep the curve. So the only only solution is either to use the l y lose the yellow or lose the rubber. And I'm in favour of keeping the rubber  because it has more more advantages than the colour yellow has. Mm-hmm. Yeah  um I guess people are willing to pay for that. So I think we can take that option and just with uh with the idea in the back of our head that you can customise your remote control. So I think that would still make it a nice product. Okay  we're final on that. So it's too bad we can't make the whole super thing. But anyways we're here. Um yeah. This we discussed just now. That's just now just we could just discuss how the project went. I mean  was kind of I sort of expected that everything would turn out this way  but because you yeah  everything cannot be for free. We didn't I think it was too bad we didn't have the financial info the last time. Because that was I th it was really essential really to ma because we spent uh uh entire stage designing a product of which we had no idea what it would cost. So we just put something I think it's really nor not in stroke with reality actually. So Yeah. Yeah  I think would have been. Materials would be ok at least the last meeting I would have expected had to have that. So I suppose Yeah  let's see if it sells. I mean I suppose this sells  because it's very very extended. But I suppose it sells  because it's good. I mean it's got everything for the for the reasonable price  because we didn't know what it's gonna cost anyway. Okay. Have been met  okay. Yeah. They're stuck under menu. For the menu. I think those are totally met  because we we really took them for the they have the feel they want  they have the simplicity they want. I think it's very uh very well met. Either two or one maybe. I think we took that everything they wanted into consideration. So it could either be a two or a one. One and a half. Just create our own option. Yeah. It's perfect. Even for deaf people  yeah. It's I don't think it's perfect  but we did everything possible to to get it back. Because if it's stuck in you couch  you can see the light. Maybe you can hear it. But I mean we tried  so I think it that's that deserves a one. Definitely. I'd use an remote control. It's pretty straight-forward  uh-huh. I think but we didn't even there was no issue on making a manual actually. We didn't really discuss it  but I don't think it takes no  it really does doesn't take time to learn  I think. We took it s it's so easy  we have so little button  everything speaks for itself really. So I think that's yeah  we didn't it's either two or one  I guess. Maybe it's a two  because d uh the L_C_D_ is a little is a little new and there is there are some option hidden under the menu button. So I might make this a two instead of a one  I guess. So just make that a two. You can use the L_C_D_ in a good way. I think so. I think it's perfect  the w where it is  what it can do  if it useful. I think so. No  y I mean in the L_C_D_ screen  the small screen. What does it display? Well I thought it was I thought it was I thought that people wanted previews on their I'm not sure if that even possible  but 'cause it's this requires a quite quite a bit of band-width. I don't think it's possible really. But the they didn't really define in what should be used for. But I think in for example like T_V_ guides  I think that's that th that you can transmit through it and everything. Just for extra information on your programmes. But also things like like like menus or p how about preferences of your uh with configuring your remote control for favourite your favourite channel for example  how do you configure that. So that could be done by L_C_D_ display. I think it's good. No  maybe it's not a one because it's we're not using it perfectly. We didn't give it I don't thing over-discussing. Now we gave it enough thought though. I think we d should just lower this. Maybe maybe it's a three though. We could've used it more effectively probably. Yeah  we are using it  but it's not it's not poorly used  but it's not efficiently used  I think. We could have ev even lost the selection button and uh done everything via L_C_D_ selection. It's now it's just extra to illustrate im uh extra features  but okay. Can you talk to remote control? Well  it can't talk anymore. So we scrap that. Oh yeah Just to be a prick  but of course you can talk to your remote control  it doesn't do anything. But you c you can talk to it. Well  we did take everything into consideration of course. Uh the shape i shape is i I think we yeah  I think that's okay. Yeah  special co but we took into consideration the fact that it's customisable to the fashi We don't have it we do have it  it's just sold as a package. It does it's not part of the basic product. It that that's what I call trendy. I mean the shape is trendy. The the sh the the functions are trendy. It's just the colours that are not supporting the basic model. Because you ha it's just not affordable at the moment. It's possible  but you have to pay extra for the for the possibility of having it in a f a different colour. Overall score. One two three. sixteen. Two two point some two point something.. Two and two thirds. It's okay  but that's yo m mostly it's it's influenced by the fact that we didn't have enough resources to implement speech recognition. 'Cause yeah  that gives you a seven  which ruins your your average. Without that it would be like under it wouldn't yeah  it would be under two. So I think we have even with this it's reasonable. Well I think it's two is okay. Yeah  two is pretty good. Definitely. Yeah  I think it's probably I I do admit that we d did miss a little or didn't sp didn't talk talk enough about the possibility of the L_C_D_ display. We could have used it more efficiently  we just didn't think of it that way. So like I said  changing channels  everything hidden in your L_C_D_ display  so you just need the navigation buttons to do everything. I think we div I think we did very well  uh ev even if you look at this score  we did quite well. It just looking for improvements what what you could have improved. So. They sh they should get kids  and just stick 'em in T_V_ and say change the channel. I don' think so. Uh it's just not it it's not affordable. Or your sh you should lose the L_C_D_ screen probably  but I think that's I think the L_C_D_ screen is more worth than speech recognition. Definitely. Okay  that was that. So that's the final product without the speakers  I guess. Let's see  what was left in the the Another one. Hmm. Yeah  we evaluate the product. General project  what's i in For example  I thou I thought we were pretty creative in what we created. We took the whole new approach of making exchangeable cover for example  which I thought was pretty creative  because it was never never ever listed somewhere. Well Anyways. Yeah  leadership is up to you. I mean perhaps I screwed up because I d put a put a speech recognition into it. But that's not for me to decide. I think we did pretty well as team-work though. Because  yeah was very hard to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime  because when I got the when I got the input for the financial results  initially of course I wanted to contact you. Say  look  this is you're doing the wrong thing  you're s you're wasting your time now  because we're implementing stuff that we cannot afford. So it would be better if y if there was more communication between uh because that's that's what would w you what you would normally do  either call or email someone. So that was too bad con was impossible here anyways.. It didn't have or didn't knew what they costs or whatever. There was just too little information about what things actually cost and if you could use them. So that was a little unclear I suppose. I think a SMARTboard SMARTboard is pretty cool. I think uh s especially for design issues  it's very easy just to give your give your thoughts a little it's easier to share them. It's a little less it the response time is le it's very bad. It's good to visualise everything  but I think the response time should could be a lot better. Definitely. Yeah  it's true. No  you don't have to. No  you don't. I jin I didn't check the finish button. I just you just ditch it and you can copy it or whatever. Uh only if you uh check the notes or press done. Then it um then you can then it exports to Word automatically. But it's not necessary to check either one of those two. You can just preview your p you can just preview your page in the in the programme. Okay  before starting a ne a new page. Okay  that could be b. Okay. Yeah  okay. That's Yeah  it's understandable  okay. Any new ideas? Yeah  more communication between between uh that's the thing I noticed  that communication is very um very important  because if you get new information  it's essential f for the other team-mates to know that as soon as possible  because you would avoid making doing extra work  because you were doing extra work now uh m working on the on the speech recognition  you have limitation both on the technical on the d on the design side. So I think that could have been better. But that's I think it's more of a a setting here that you cannot communicate than uh than somewhere else. So Yeah  I think so. And l less p less spam probably. I'm not sure i I'm not sure you got spammed as well  but I get spammed like every t every two minutes there was a there was another email about master classes or something. So which were totally useless actually. I thought I should probably look into them  but they were all useless. So I just Oh okay. I didn't have any uh more information  it's just always the same here. So that's that's kind of a It would change  but not for me. So I'd I had no extra information to go on that one than what you give me actually. I couldn't do any research myself or I see  that's yeah  w I could have done a little extra work probably  then But I was busy enough anyway. So Any new ideas found? Or is that a 'cause uh yeah  it's well  probably is. I have no clue. That's like oh but it Should i if the project is evaluated and it was it was in b within budget  we should celebrate. So Uh okay  think that's about it. Uh I'm not sure what we should still do though uh t let's see what all your tasks were finished  right? What you ha from your assistant. So let's Okay  I should I think I sh I still have the the total report to finish up. I think we took very little time now  because Yeah  we're in agreement  everything the design is okay. The one thing we missed though  we don't have a product name. How about you cook a how about you cook up a product name? Just oh  think of a catchy name. I'll be working on this until the beep until it beeps. So What? Fruit? You don't want it to resemble a banana. It's not yellow anyway. It's not yellow anymore. It is curved  but No  it's Hmm. Real Reaction future R_C_. Step into the future of of remote controlling your T_V_. No that's a that's a catchy slogan. Control your remote control. I go for future R_C_ probably. Something like It's short f Real reactor? Uh that that's That makes me think of different products than a remote control really. I'm not sure. Real reaction in a real Real reactor. Didn't notice. Mm. I take f yeah  take a banana. Hmm. No  not like that. It should be it should be longer  because it's not a product name that you f print on a box. Just write out triple  like a word triple R_C_  triple stripe Oh. Triple dash R_ dash s s C_. Yeah. R_ dash C_. Dash. Triple R_ or triple R_C_? How about do both? Sure if it looks stupid. Uh I think that the the R_C_ together takes away the the the image of it's a triple Uh the first the first one looks like it's a triple remote control  but it's only a single remote control. And it's especially on the triple R_ that's important. The Real Reaction Remote. Yeah  triple R_ yeah  you can Yeah  triple R_. Banana remote. I think we're all in agreement about the triple R_. I think triple R_ is cool. And it looks cool when you print it in font  looks pretty cool. Just like this just and you just print triple R_  it looks doesn't look bad  it's short  it's okay. So have to write my report now  I guess. Um Um Yeah  so we have everything. We have the product  we have the costs  we have the possibility of everything. Okay. I think it's adjourned. Retire to my lair and finish the report. That was a short meeting. But efficient though. Probably. See. Okay  goodbye. Could you guys draw me a picture of the final design to put on the cover of the report? ,The project manager opens the meeting by recapping the discussions of the previous meeting  telling the group this meeting's agenda  and stating what each person will do for the next meeting. Then the industrial designer talks about the components design and explains exactly what remotes do and how they operate. He also talks about batteries and chips. The interface specialist present research from the internet about user interface. He talks about minimizing the clutter on the remote  and suggests using a slide button like on a mouse. The marketing expert presents  talking about trend-watching and how fruits and vegetables are currently an important theme. They talk about making changable colors available and possibly including batteries with them. They discuss what the remote should look like in terms of shape color  and then talk about components  materials  and energy sources. Then they close the meeting. 
Okay  good morning. This is our first team meeting. I'll be your Project Manager for today  for this project. My name is Mark will be giving this presentation for you to kick the project off. That's my uh that's the agenda for today. Well  of course we're new to each other  so I'd like to get acquainted first. So let's do that first  I mean Let's start with you  can you introduce yourself? You're our Marketing Expert. Okay  excellent. And you are User Interface Yeah. Excellent. Okay. What should it look like? Okay. Oh  let's kick it off. Oh  there we go. So  our new project is about we need design a remote control for television set  so  which has to be original  trendy and user-friendly. I took this off our corporate website. It's I think well it sums up what we need to do. We're inspired by latest fashion  not only electronics  but also the latest trends in clothes and interior design. That's why our product will always fit in your home. So apparently we need to um be very at um very open to what's currently hot in the market. So that's what you need to do to bring us the latest info and what people want. So So we put the fashion in electronics. So that's what we need to go for. Anyway  we'll take this project in three steps  three pha uh three phase of design. First step will be the functional design. And that's basically what we're gonna do. Everybody has uh a piece of individual work and a meeting afterwards  so we can share information about So I'm gonna keep this short  since we had a technical problem. So skip through this. Uh. Okay. Every meeting we everybody can present their uh their views and everything  so to help with these  you have we have the SMARTboards here. We can use a regular PowerPoint presentation. I'm supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board  so it's actually it's very easy. Like it says  very simple  you just take out the pen. Like you see here  I'll just take the take here. That's it  you just put it on the board. You see a pen here. You go here  just like using a pen. You can just draw whatever you want. It's like the eraser  can erase whatever you want. And so it will be easy just to illustrate your views  if you wanna change the format  you just either take out jus just like the pen  and whatever you want  your current colour  your line width  just to make the line bigger. So it should be really easy. This is to take the just take a new slide and back again. We're just gonna keep using this board all the time  so I think it will be it's very clear for everyone  I suppose. So I'll take this out. Okay. We'll use that later. Anyway. Yeah  just just just stuff that you wanna share  just put it in the in the project folder  like I put my presentation now. I'll put the the minutes of every meeting  I'll put them there too  so everybody can read up if they have to leave early or whatever. So next  been here. Well  gonna give the electronic white-board uh a shot. So basic idea is we have a blank sheet. Just try whatever you want  and like it says  draw your favourite animal. I think the creative genius should go first. So  draw us your favourite animal. Draw us a technical animal. Yeah  it's still erasing. So that's what we don't want. We want a high-responsive product. So It looks more like nuclear bomb. Let's go easy on it. Anyway  it should It It's supposed to be a dolphin  you like the freedom that it that it represents. What do you like? Okay. Well  our Marketing Expert. Show us an animal. Pick a pick a pick a clean sheet. Oh. Take a clean sheet first. Just press next. That's it. It's a cute elephant. It's a nice beard. Okay  so it's just a bee. So I suggest you make us the elephant in the market. The big and strong player in the market. This would be good. Okay  excellent. On to the next one. Press next. Yeah  it's up there. That's it. Sure looks smooth. What does it want? Okay. I agree. Yay  I'm supposed to draw the animal next. I introduce to the world the amazing ant. Great team-workers. Do everything to Uh really small  but together they're really strong. So I'm gonna give it a smiley face. Not sure where the p. Just put 'em here. Whatever. Think it need shoes. So I'm just too lazy to draw it all black  so That's the coolest ant ever. I love to draw ants. It's my hobby. Anyway Nah. Just I think it's very representative what we drew  I guess. Like you take just take your freedom and use a a trendy interface that you design for us. Just Yeah. You're supposed to make i make it different from uh from what other people have  and just make it a little distinct. Anyway. another beep to stop the meeting. See. Warning. Finish meeting now. Uh put this down. Examples. Well I guess we have a little little time extra  but Just a little quick discussion to to open open our work. So what do you guys think about The first idea is just very short. I'll start with you. What are y What are your first ideas for the new product? What The project I got was just for a T_V_ remote control. Yeah  I guess so. Okay  so very intuitive design  I guess. Yeah  we want I suppose we want almost everyone to be using it. So I think I mean  really disabled people  yeah  might be a problem  but I think it's a little take it into consideration. Um yeah. I think we really need to cut the meeting short. You have anything you wanna share quickly? It should be light  okay. Um  let's see  where did I Let's skip that. Oh  this is it. Sorry  I skipped this sheet. What do we This Quick What we're going to Selling price  twenty five Euros. That's for you. The production price  twelve and a half Euros  approximately. Just go go for that. We'll reach the uh reach that profit. No  it's not much to work on. I'm sorry  I skipped it. Anyways  that's Yeah  this is it. Do you have anything you you came up with yet? About uh marketing transfer  whatever? Marketing I'm not sure what you what you came up with yet. You have anything to share? Or else we'll cut the meeting just cut the meeting short since we're supposed to stop. Okay. Anyways  the the personal coach will give you the your p your personal assignments and everything. So we'll just meet back in here thirty minutes. I'm sure we have that. Yeah  thanks for attending. I'll see you back here in thirty minutes. Morning. Yes. Um my name is Dirk  Dirk Meinfeld. Um I will be uh Pr Project the Marketing Expert. And I will see what the user wants and uh what we can do uh with the new produ project product. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Very nice dolphin. Um an animal. I like the elephant. What? Yeah. Um Oh yeah. Oh  a blank. Okay  next. Free  I like the elephant. It's big  it's strong  so uh uh Oh  it's a little bit You have to hold it  right? Hmm. It's a beautiful animal. Oh  you have to p press it pretty hard. With a smile on it  it's very important. Yeah. And uh not to forget its tail. Oh. Yeah  it's okay. Yes. I will beat the dolphin. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh yeah. Yeah. Experience with the tiger. What? They are Okay uh-huh. Oh. Mm. Okay. Uh hard worker. Yeah. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Uh Yeah. But Yeah. Uh. Yeah. Selling price. international. Um about what? Marketing? Um no  not really yet  but I've some ideas and I will uh say it uh Okay. Okay. Yes. Morning. My name is Xavier Juergens  I'm the Industrial Designer  and there are three main questions that I have to find an answer to today. First one is uh what happens inside the apparatus  second is what is uh the apparatus made of  and the third is what should it look like. Uh-huh. Mm. Okay. Okay  you should press next. Okay. Okay  well the animal I'd like to draw is a tiger. My drawing skills are really bad  so. They are really bad  my drawing skills. I'm not sure how the legs should go  but Uh these are stripes. I've picked this animal because it's very fast. It is uh it knows exactly what it wants. Uh it hardly ever wastes any resources. Uh well  basically uh it hunts for prey  but it does it always in a very well-thought way. Uh it knows exactly what it wants. It never kills an animal uh just for the killing  so it's very efficient. And it tries to do everything as fast as possible. And it always goes for uh security  in seeking uh uh a hide spot and uh and doing everything  security  speed and efficiency is important. And I think uh those things we can use. Yeah. Oh. Hmm. Only one thing uh that has to be added according to me is uh the the material it is made of  it should be something light. That's it speaks for itself  but some uh Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Good luck everyone. Good day. Nick Broer  User Interface Designer. I'm going to uh look at the technical design from the uh user point of view. The creative genius? Thank you very much. Well  I'm more into the technical aspects of drawing  so I'm not really good at drawing animals  but uh the animal which I Oh. Pen. Uh format. Else my animal will be like king-size. I pretty much like a dolphin  because of its uh its freedom basically. Let's see. A head. actually worked with this. It's like uh it's a very Uh high-tech. Bit low-responsive though. Prefer pen and paper. It doesn't look like a nuclear bomb. This thing isn't doing what I'm What I want. So Yeah  well it does look like a nuclear bomb. I'll just finish up real soon  because I'm So it doesn't really look like a dolphin  but then again  this is all new for me. Like the ocean  like swimming. Do that in my spare time  so that's basically an Now we can forget this ever happened. It's not really that responsive  no. And you was making comments on my dolphin. You picked a hard one  didn't you? Got it. You've done this before  haven't you? Well  I basically had a question. Do uh Are we going to introduce a multi remote control? Is it just the T_V_ or do we want to in Just for T_V_ remote control. Okay. Well  I was thinking about design remote control  with our uh motto and all. Uh thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with. No rational changes or whatever  'cause it revolutionary changes  yes. Uh we might have to consider other design aspects of our product. So that was something I wanted to add  and perhaps some usability aspect. T_V_ is becoming central in most homes. Do we want people who are disabled in any way to uh  yeah  to be able to use it as well? Yeah. Okay  well that's not that much to work with. Mm  good luck. ,For the conceptual design  the marketing expert talked about the public's preference for looks and texture over technological innovation; however  they both seem to be more important than ease of use. The current fashion among younger people favours bright colours and fruit and vegetable themes: pertinent exchangeable fronts can express such trends on the remote. Materials also need to be strong: the marketing expert suggested an iron-plate or titanium front. The industrial designer suggested they use rubber push buttons (and no scroll wheel)  simple battery (instead of solar cells or kinetic dynamo)  and advanced chip. Speech recognition can be implemented  but it does not link speech commands to remote control actions. He also advised that the users within the target group prefer primary colours  soft textures and curved shapes. The team drew a provisional prototype. They placed the LCD below the buttons. If it is implemented  a recording button  microphone and speaker need to be included in the design. Finally  they decided to have a titanium case with plastic front and the company logo and slogan engraved. Packages with a variety of changeable fronts will be launched. 
Mm. Okay. Yeah  it's in the it's in the folder yeah. Mm. Okay  this is a brief run through of the um of the technical functions of the remote. As um is uh the the the presentation is uh already slightly obsolete because I had in mind something that would uh be i be aimed at controlling multiple devices but uh there's still stuff of relevance  so press on. I've looked at looked at a num uh couple of other uh remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles. Um and wasn't really satisfied by what I saw I have to say so this is more sort of springboard for uh how these could be improved on. Um um basically the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance  in this case the television set. Um to save you getting off your backside. Um and there's two main trends in th in the sort of design practice. On the one hand and this uh this particularly relates to its sort of earliest models where with you know i so so many buttons on it so about the size of the television set. Um giving you every possible function that the that the device has  the remote control controls. And most of these functions are not going to be used  it creates a rather user unfriendly interface. And on the other hand there's a user focused approach that pares things down to just what what is most likely to get used. Um With uh a and a and of course there is a certain amount of sort of loss of function here obviously  but mostly that's relatively peripheral functions. And so you go for something that's fairly intuitive to use  and um well f the for the most part for T_V_ remote it's uh tha that would be channel control and volume. Um and if you if you if you are wanting to incorporate uh control of a D_V_ D_V_D_ or uh V_C_R_ presumably into that then there's a play  pause  stop  rewind  fast-forward  record  so forth. Um. My own view is that we should definitely be going for a user focused design. Um but uh the pro I think the problem with a lot of the sort of user focused designs that are about is that they sort of make assumptions in advance about what uh what a given user's going to uh want mo want to do from want it to do most. So  something that's uh something that is more programmable  that uh perh perhaps has the full range of functions available to it but you can then specify yourself what you're most likely to want. Um so that those are then immediately accessible through fairly minimal number of controls  um I liked Ebenezer's idea of including a joystick in that and uh possibly a sort of fairly minimal number of sort of function buttons  and have a disp you then have some sort of basic display on it so that if you're um sort of cha changing from different modes for the device it'll tell you just exactly what uh you know each direction of the uh of the um joystick's going to do or wha or what each function button's going to do. Um  this is actually a again slightly taking inspiration off of uh games controllers  you know the Playstation control where you have four basic function buttons that are just marked with um distinctive uh geometrical shapes but the and then dependent on what you're doing with it what game and so on um those uh those functions are then sort of further specified. And so it's taking taking the lead from that. Um. That's it. Mm. Mm. Mm. I I was thinking that the remote the um sort of default functions for the joystick would be up and down for uh volume  left and right for channels. Um I think probably for the first couple of hours of using it um but you know muscle memory's a wonderful thing  um. And I think and I think that size of uh display was about what I had in mind. Um though I mean I w I would say that uh we could probably probably be required to um mo most of the mobile phone displays you see these days are colour but we should probably try to stick to black and white. Si si simply to keep m keep the unit cost down. Um I mean colour could be a sort of subsequent development but uh you know cost a bit of extra money f w w w w w once everyone's got the first  you know  oh colour's out  we'll have to replace it won't we. It does nothing extra. Mm. Mm. Mm. I th the thing I like about the uh the uh joystick is that uh you you you then basically you can then basically put it I mean for for T_ T_ for T_V_ remote alone  you could put um I mean there are like I say the the the main things people do with a T_V_ remote control is the volume and the channel. You can pack all that onto was onto a single control. Um. But uh but the but then o uh obviously if uh you know if you i if you wanted to access further functions i you you then get to sort of menu navigation. I mean with things like ch with things like tuning and channels um you know adjusting brightn uh brightness and fiddly things that no one really bothers with  most T_V_s these days actually have menus anyway so this would be a fairly rational way of integra integrating the uh the remote with the device it's controlling. Um concern about our market. Um  if we are I mean most of the uh of the replacement remote market is sort of remote control rationalisation. Um  you've got twenty different devices in your living room  you want one wo y you want one that'll do the job of all of them. Um  if all you're replacing is one of the you know however many remotes you have in your living room  um you know you still need separate remotes for everything else. I just think that uh possibly mm. Mm. Mm. Does that um would that include um access to say interactive functions on digital or cable? Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm. Just a thought. Um maybe then our market should be T_V_ manufacturers  rather than the public. Try and sell it t sell it to them to supply with um Mm  yeah  I've seen them. Mm. Yeah  I think that's a good idea. Mm. Mm yeah. Yeah  I think that's Yeah. For volume. Actually how Actually I would say maybe two two function buttons  the y we're now using the menus button and um and an og and an okay button. I mean certainly something I've found with the joystick on mo the joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time th the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for okay. Or vice versa. And that's really irritating. The o the o the other dis design constraint I think we should bear in mind is that people are you know very much used to using a remote control one handedly  um  so we need to make sure that e even with the joystick  you know something that can just sit comfortably in the palm of the hand and have the joystick just controlled by the thumb. Oh. So so a small speaker you mean. Mm-hmm. Blue ones particularly. Plus that's a nice wee design touch. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Actually one one wee thought about that. Um  if we do end up trying to market this to television manufacturers then the um then the transmitter could actually be built into the television. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. You know I think I mean if it w if we get a major television manufacturer to say y oh yeah we'll have that  save us the bother  then that's you know vast amounts of sales. Quite quickly. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. I thought the uh the d the double arc could perhaps uh be the uh the enter button.. No on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's a project documents link. A well actually just there. Yeah. That's it. If you dump it in there. Your username. Okay. Excellent. Right. Hopefully that's us ready to uh to go. So. Functional design meeting. We'll have to flesh out some of the uh stuff. Um we'll start with the minutes of the last meeting. Not a lot thankfully to say. We introduced ourselves  discussed the possibility of a macro facility  interac interacting the T_V_ a bit more  um mentioning of bar-code  joystick for user manipulation  um and ergonomics of the remote control as well. Um it's come to my attention the following. Teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet. Remote control should only be used for the T_V_. Um due for uh time to market and possibly also cost issues. Um also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable  um f uh your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there. Um. Now. Just to say quickly uh I would have thought that only being used for a television the macro facility may now not be required. Um or at l its functionality would have been of limited use. So to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing. Um if anybody disagrees we can uh definitely say so. Um and hopefully we'll just crack on and we'll get everything going. Um I'd like to if possible hear from our Marketing Expert first  to help us gain an idea of where we're going to go. So um I'll just load up your presentation from here if you want. Yep. Sorry. Uh. Is yours the Oh sorry. Okay  right. Uh if you that's all right. If you do you want me to just cycle through it for you or? Yeah? Okay. Okay. Yep. Okay  yep. Mm-hmm. If you could uh sor if you could speed it up a bit  yeah. If you could uh speed it up a bit please  yeah. Sorry. Cool. Okay. Excellent. Right. Um. Hear from the User Interface Designer now I think might be an idea. Um  you've got your presentation now  is it on the is it? Okay. Technical functions? No. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Right. Um  if we could hear from our Industrial engineer  or Designer. If you look on the desktop you'll find that there's a link to the project folder  or project documents. If you save it in there we can open it up from here. Are you finding it okay or? Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Oh. Yeah. Ah  don't worry about it at all mate. Okay. Well. Oh sorry  I'm I'm interrupting you. Are you is it yeah? Okay. Right. Um  right we can probably skip that for now. So  we've had some stuff put forward  um along with the new user requirements  um we've had a lot of kind of input I'd say so far. Um I hear what the Marketing Expert's saying about um voice activated control. However I've got a couple of worries about that. The power required  um and the ability to the cost  it seems like for uh an embedded system  this could cause us issues. Um for example you see that there's fairly robust services on uh computers via uh via voice  I_B_M_ do um drag and dictate  but these require a lot of memory and usually um state quite advanced processor requirements. Um voice activation could be an interesting idea but I think that our Ind Industrial Designer would probably upon some research say that it's maybe not feasible. Um that's just my view right now  however the idea of a joystick and then maybe an L_C_D_ which has been kind of put forward so far  it's almost like having a small T_ not T_V_ to say  but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display  I don't know how much power an L_C_D_ would take  but it might be quite low? Well literally um if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than um those on a a mobile phone  something where you can read an an um fair amount of information  traverse maybe quite a few menus  if we maybe used mobile phones as a good example  they usually incorporate they have the keypad  and then evr all the other functionality is usually associated inside by traversing around. That could be one possibility. Um and then we could have like say the common buttons as you say  volume control  changing channels We I would agree with you. Mm-hmm. That would be my feeling as well  I think we could possibly create quite a useful user interface. Um now I mean I don't sorry  go for it. I think it could probably be aimed at most people who've used a mobile. And that might be just another way of saying try to target most people. Um  if we are if we were to follow that avenue  we might be s you know um we're kind of almost relying on their experience with a mobile phone I suppose. But that does cover a very large section of the people out there. Um  I mean I imagine as well that the actual L_C_D_ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality. Which maybe doesn't get used as often  maybe it makes it easy for them to figure out how to um change the channels as in the frequencies and such for reprogramming it. Um and you can still have the main buttons that allow the people to turn the machine on and off  d up and down  it depends  I mean maybe we have the fol um the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then  that there's just a a small number of as you were saying uh buttons that have already been defined. So like we go for the nice standard um up and down for and volume control. So that literally anybody can come along  pick up the remote and still know what do do. And they can completely ignore most of the functionality which would be for say the o actual owner of the the T_V_ and who would normally use the unit. I dunno. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well this is a requirement that we have to stick to I'm afraid  this isn't one that I've just arbitrarily decided on. So um this is this is one of the solid ones that has to be obeyed  for now. So I can understand your point  and I would agree with you  but this is our design spec for now. 'Fraid to say. Um I would say so  yes  because then we have to be able to control the remote boxes  and that is a separate unit. Um I think that it I would say that the design spec we've been with is for the television only for now. And until we hear otherwise we should go with just that. Okay. Maybe we'll hear differently  but for now It would be ease of manipulation of certain functions  yes. Um There is that possibility  yes. B However I don't know exactly where we'll be going with that  but it might not even be the avenue of the Marketing Expert  that might be sales  who are not in this meeting. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well  something else that you brought up was uh the ability to lose a remote  which as you said you've done  in fact we've probably all done. Um  I don't know if it's a gimmick or not  but have any of you ever seen those odd little key rings where if you whistle  it will beep and you tell you where it is. Um. Well the other option of course is that um the well I was going to say clapping  um Um digital telephones  uh for example  one unit has of course you have to have that base unit  somewhere where there's a button  but maybe it's a button that you attach to the T_V_. Something which you when you press that  it would beep to give its location away  on the remote unit. And that could be something could um separate us a bit. And that way  because we're attaching what would be a small button to the T_V_  again say what  it would be a small transmitter  um watch battery type scenario I would say  or something that if it was problems enough you could actually even just um I don't power that might be something that we could look into. Yep. Yeah  it's uh putting a lot on your shoulders there  so I mean that could be something that separates us a bit from the market as well. So. To go on from here. Um we have to decide exactly what we're going to do with the remote. Before we leave this meeting  it would be best to say this is what we're going this is the design we're gonna try and get  this is how we're gonna make ourselves look unique. Do we go for maybe a remote contro uh sorry  we're gonna go for a remote control obviously  do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels  up and down  and then  what  another button that would say that it's now being used to manoeuvre round the L_C_D_. We could use say the left and right for changing channels and the up and down for volume  and Okay. Mm-hmm. Vol Volume selection okay  yep  the teletext we're gambling with  and we're gonna say it's dead  the way of the dodo So we well  sorry  we could maybe even go as far as saying power button  small joystick  L_C_D_  and then what maybe is it one more button to say that you're using the menu system  and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay? So we're having very very few buttons involved  but navigation around a menu for most things. Okay. Okay. Um Okay. So um we're actually that sounds like a rough idea. Do we incorporate the idea of trying to f locate the remote control again via a beeping noise? Do you mind looking? The ability to locate it again. So that would require a um transmitter maybe attached to the T_V_  just so that it says find me  and what  a basically a small microphone um on the actual unit  can maybe hide it in the base. Sorry? Some speaker  sorry  yeah. Um E us we might be better with the sound possibly we could maybe incorporate th e the true fact  considering the cost of an L_E_D_  we could just incorporate it anyway. The L_E_D_s can be surprisingly bright now. Um. So by the sounds of it  with what we're suggesting so far  your design um the user interface is still quite open  you could go for quite an interesting design. Because we're only going to have a very few key and you've got you know a small L_C_D_  joystick  e I think it leaves you open to a a potential wide range of shapes  something that can make it stand out slightly. Um if you could look into what we've suggested so far  the feasibility of um small transmitter  um and such  maybe if an L_C_D_ screen requires too much power  or such. Ebenezer  um  Marketing Expert If  yeah if you could maybe as well see what people think about the idea of this minimalist approach that we've taken  where of a joystick to control the very basic functions  and then the idea of manipulating it like you would a mobile. I don't know how easy that will be within the time frame  but could be something we could maybe look into. Okay. Um any last comments that anybody would like to put forward? Anything that they think has been missed out. Bit of a wide open question there of course. Feel free to email me if you think that uh we've screwed something up and wanna get it rectified as soon as possible. Right. Speaker and L_E_D_ for locating  um  transmitter getting the external power source  yep  that's quite true. Um  and something that we can can easily be adopted at the last minute as well I'd say. The electronics could be s either placed externally or internally  makes no difference to the final product of the actual remote control  so that's good. Uses maybe gives us a new potential market. 'Kay. Oh  one thing that we've almost not talked about at all  my apologies for that  um  user interface  we also need to maybe get the slogan in here  um it's  I'm pointing at my laptop  what in God Real reaction  and such. So um Oh  sorry. My apologies. No it could well be  I've probably missed that. Um  I think that's l almost the last minute thing we can just incorporate into the actual plastic on top. So I'm not too concerned a that we haven't gone into depth about that. But it might be something you could consider when you're thinking about shapes? In fact we might like to put a slogan on  and um possibly the two R_s to signify the company. Rather than real reaction. Sounds good. And I'd say that that's us for now. Okay. How did where did where did you get all your in information? Oh. Ah  okay. Yeah. Uh  I was still working on stuff  I hadn't got it finished. Um  alright. Click to save in where do I have to save it? Um  what I've done with it  I'm sorry. Shit. Um I'm just closing it now. where I've saved it. that's it there  yeah. Oh right. Uh  right I'm responsible for working design  uh  this is basically the inside going on of the the uh remote control. So we have the energy source  we have the user interface  this this is what I've seen. Uh the sender will push the button  the chip will respond  uh and then the dig digital signal is sent to the T_V_. So uh uh  if you go to next slide  you'll see you'll see uh what do we need on the user interface. Do we need uh many buttons  or do we need l many light bulbs that could be easier to uh to realise which appliances are on or not. Um   or would that take too much power  would we need more um components in there to supply the power? Um  the joystick is another thing  if we were gonna add that  um  there'd be more components to deal with that. Um  so uh we need to I dunno exactly what That's the design of the the the layout of the uh electronic design  but um obviously there'll be more details once we've decided what we're putting on the user interface. So  that'll be decided  I guess. Uh  and the next slide. Oh  yeah Um  if you go to the next slide then. I just used the it was a mess  uh I was just putting adding it together at the end there. Uh Uh so you have the energy source obviously connected to the chip  and the user interface obviously contains everything. You have the switch turn it on  infrared bulb  uh will contact the T_V_ and will have whatever device or D_V_D_ player  the bulb will turn on to say it's on. Uh  so do we need on the control uh different buttons to decide  or different light bulbs  would it be easier? Um  I dunno what we should decide on that. No  it's finished  yeah. Cost. Mm. L_C_D_ on the remote just telling you what's on  or uh  interactive L_C_D_ or Do you think that people will get mixed up  like  they'll be looking at this screen and that screen and then  you know  trying to get everything working  would it be a bit confusing? Yeah. Yeah We're just saying volume. Should volume be important in the joystick  do you think? Yep. I Yeah  think so. Light bulb as well  no? And a light bulb? No. To flash. No. Nah  you'd see it anyway  if you hear it. Yeah. Mm-hmm. So I should just look at um the speaker  the speaker and an L_E_D_. And Yeah  and a transmitter. P Fashion. The slogan is yeah  the slogan's we put the fashion in electronics  isn't it? 'S also look cool. Just put it on the deskt desktop. Project documents  yeah. What's your username? What's your username and password? Mm-hmm. Sorry. Okay. There we go. 'Kay. Sure. Um  sh would you like to I'll just do it from here. Um  try second one maybe. Try it  yeah maybe. Yeah. Okay. Oh  I thought I put in my last name  I guess not  but. Okay. Oh yeah  that'd be fine  that'd be great. Okay. Functional requirement by me Ebenezer. Okay  so um we did some research  we asked one hundred people their opinions on remote controls. We asked some uh open ended questions  just  what are your opinions on the remote control  got a lot of re responses  and we asked some very specific questions  and we got a lot of good feedback. Please bear in mind this is only a hundred people  so even when the groups are divided into fifteen to twenty five  twenty five to thirty five  there's only maybe ten people fifteen people in each group. Okay. So we got some the bad stuff we got  remotes are often lost. I often lose my remote control  the back of the couch  some place  and even if it's not lost permanently  it takes me a few minutes to find it. Most buttons are not used any more  like you said  teletext is outdated now. I remember trying to load a D_V_D_ player recently  and there were so many buttons  it took me I don't know maybe ten minutes to to go through each button  'cause you have to press the shift button to access the yellow buttons  you know there's just a lot of stuff that no one really uses. And if they do  not very often. Takes too long to master the remote control. I've seen some remote controls that are big  they have a lot of buttons  you have to hold down more than one key at one time to do something  they're just not great to use. We just got a lot of bad complaints about remote controls  people do not like remote controls. Some of the good stuff we got. Between the age of uh fifteen and twenty five  most people would be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software. Now don't get excited yet  I've got more to say on that. Most people'd be willing to pay for that um most people want remote controls to be pretty  they want it to be fancy  th they they want it to be different  everybody has a white remote control with black buttons  and a red button and a green button  not everybody wants that. Finally  my opinion. The voice recognition thing is cool. And uh voice recognition  the software  open source software exist already. It's a bit sketchy at some times  uh  you're not gonna get good always accurate results  but for a very fixed number of words  you know you have  how many different words can you have for a remote control  up  down  left  right  channel five  channel seven  you know  how many  you can't have that many words. For a fixed vocabulary it works quite well. I'm pretty sure people would buy it. But after a while people may wanna return it  because if you have to to say som I mean most people use a remote control for switching to channels  and they say they do that about ninety eight percent of the time. Using the remote control  ninety eight percent of the time for changing channels  and that's for flickering through channels. So if you have to say up  up  up  up  if you have to do that all the time  then people might get a bit fed up with that and they may return it. However  oh  because the voice recognition software exists already  there's no need to spend money on research and development  but this does mean the need for microphones in the in the remote control  which is an unusual feature in my opinion. But if we do have the voice recognition thing  there's a lot of stuff that you can uh get rid of. See  you could there're two options. Either you have voice recognition by itself  which I think is a bit impractical for like night time if you wanna be watching television and you wanna be quiet  or I don't know you have a visitor coming round and the remote's only trained for you  it's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself. So you can have voice recognition and a regular remote. But imagine you got rid of the regular remote part  then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look  because there are no restrictions on physical size  or shape  it it could be as fancy as you want it to be  you know  it could be like a lollipop or something like that  something weird like that. As long as the voice recognition stuff works  that's that's fine. So we have the three birds  we have the design  that we have the the fancy bit  right  the voice recognition's fancy  it's cool  it's different  it's radical  so  and then we have an extra bit I don't remember so I'm pretty sure people will buy the remote  but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control  I think is a big question. Um  will people will people be willing to wait for the the period that it'll take to train the remote  'cause I think it will the remote will uh get better over time with the same user user  but for the first week or for the first two weeks are you willing to wait  are you willing to have a bad remote control. And uh what if you have visitors come round  they stay the night  they wanna use the T_V_  they can't use the remote because they speak differently to you. Um  how do you account for regional accents and stuff like that. Uh  will people return the remote control  I think a lot of young people will buy the remote control  if they have the money  you know  so  do our audience have the money  but would they return it after a while because it's not as fast as pressing a button  it's not a practical. So. These are things I think we should consider. I think it's cool  I'm sorry? Sure. I'm about to end  yeah. I think it's cool but there are definitely some considerations. So  yeah. There was uh a website  uh  right here. G I started making stuff up  then I got an email saying Mm. Well like if you go to one  uh whichever one you were working yeah  and you just click file save as. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. Mm. I uh Mm-hmm. Mm. Sure but the idea of a remote with a menu or and a joystick I think like I h if I was in the habit of buying remote controls then I would want one  but I think we don't have a specific audience  you know  like what is our target audience  what niche are niche are we trying to market and corner. You know  you know what I'm saying  like  for whom is this intended? Everybody? Most people  yeah. Mm-hmm. Sure. I think that's fair yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Hmm. Okay  specifically television. So the joystick is just for differentness. Okay. Mm. Mm-hmm. It's just  the way I figure it  twelve point five Euros per unit  we have to sell at least like three million or something like that  not to account for all the the money we waste on remotes that no one buys  you know  like if we made a perf if we made a ks for every remote we made someone bought it  then we have to sell a lot of remote controls. We just Is this gonna be enough to to sell? Yeah. I had one of those  and my brother  and my dad  could have beat me up because it it went off all the time accidentally. The clapping one. To a television. Yeah. Yeah  that's a good idea. I think so  yeah. But we have a frequency of how what people use a remote control for most. Um  power is used like once per hour  channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight per hour  that's by far the biggest one  and then teletext  is still here  that's like fourteen  and volume selection. No  yeah  okay okay. Yeah  um Mm-hmm. Um  I think because it's so small it might be an uh I mean if we only have like two three buttons it might be essential to have to have that Yeah. Speaker yeah. W those little key-rings have both  so Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well I can give you the frequency  what people what options people use most often  I guess that's gonna be important in the ts defining the the software side of the interface  right. You want the stuff. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Sure. Sure. Mm. Sure. 'Kay. Yeah. Transmitter. ,The project manager opened the meeting and went over the minutes of the previous meeting. The marketing expert presented findings from trend watching reports and discussed her personal preferences in how to incorporate the results of the trend watching reports into the appearance of the remote. The trend watching reports indicated that products need to reflect a fruit and vegetable theme  sponginess  fanciness  and technological innovation. The team then discussed their target group and whether to use titanium or a spongy material in their design. The industrial designer discussed options for energy sources  materials  case shapes  and interface components such as buttons and LCD screens. The user interface designer examined the interfaces of existing products and discussed using menus within an interface using push buttons which operate like a scroll wheel. The team then discussed and made decisions on what energy sources  chips  case materials  and buttons to use. 
Hello  uh this meeting we are it's fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control. Um the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept and I think the last time we talked about an a lot and we had a rough idea of what is going to be  but uh in th at the end of this meeting we have to to reach a decision. So  uh we will have again three presentation  from all of you  and uh I hope it will be fast because I would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions. So  who wants to start? Okay. So start  uh Uh. This one? Turn. Hmm. Okay. Like a sponge. Yeah. Yeah  uh yeah. Easy to use  is it uh a as much as important than technology or fancy thing. It's less important  right? Yeah yeah. Okay. So  Hamed  can you. Mm-hmm. Um. Number? Three. This one? So it's not this one. Okay. Yeah. This one  yeah. Oh . Oops. Can you fit any uh for example a T_F_T_ or any electronic device in a spongy thing  or is there any problem for that? For example  put electronic card on a spongy thing  I can I can imagine it could be a problem. Yep. Okay. So Okay. Maybe put electronic in a box and a spongy thing around. maybe after. Yeah. No  I don't think it's seven by seven  I think it's seven the diagonal is seven. Usually when they say seven inch I think it's the diagonal. Yeah. I dunno I dun I dun One each. But  yeah . Let's go. So let's cut the T_F_T_. Mm. These technical engineers  huh. What user wants. He wants a small remote control  or? Uh uh with big buttons. It's difficult. A sm So maybe you can finish your presentation  and afterwards we will discuss about all this. That's it. Okay. So. No. Uh  so I think we have a lot We have to take decision today  so I think we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions. Uh first I think energy it's a key problem because uh it depend what can we have as feature if we use only batteries  for example  or something like that. Because can we have L_C_D_ and speech recognition with battery  and it's also r related to the size of the of the devi of the device? Okay. So Okay. Uh like but using how many batteries  for example? Are are what Maybe what is the size of the battery Okay. Uh one two Okay. The television lights. At least when there is T_V_ you can get light from the T_V_. I dunno. Okay. Mm. At least it's new and maybe technology New technology. Yeah. Um. So I think before talking about the other thing  it's important thing it's the case. Uh what what are gonna be the size  because its weight drives the other what we are going to use as features and so on. For example for the for the L_C_D_  if we choose to have a small device  we cannot use this um a such a a a screen. Oh. I've I s I think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller L_C_D_  if it's possible. Okay. So we are agree with a small L_C_D_. Yeah. Tactile or something  yeah. Touch screen  yeah. Yeah. The problem is we have a limit in a month of time  so we cannot do something very new. So let's go for a small L_C_D_. Yeah okay. So  five by s ten. Um so what about  so the case we talked about. Um something easy to use  you said something easy to use but how does that fit in a fashion way  like with fruit and vegetable  and about the colour and logo of the of the company and so on  now  can we do that? My first idea is because our colour is more yellow  and the it should be easy to take in a hand  I thought about banana  or something like that  which is fruits  and A big banana. Um. Yeah. Yeah. But it's just an idea. I dunno what you think about  but Yeah. I dunno if it can fit with the technology. You are the specialists of that. So Yeah  and The screen has to be square? Or it can be like a a shape  quite  uh with curves. It could. Yeah. Okay okay. Yeah. Yeah  it should remember banana  but it's not doesn't have to b to be uh uh really the size and exactly the shape of a banana. So we are agree with the banana thing? Okay. So  the last point we decided it's infra-red  I guess. Everybody's agreed. Uh  so that's it I think about the concepts. You have other thing to add to this point  or uh no? So  uh about the user interface  so we are going to use L_C_D_. In the last meeting we talked about uh hidden buttons. I don't know what we are going to do with that. You talked about the buttons on the side Mm what? Yeah. Okay. And you mean the first layer would be spongy. So Is it is it possible to do that? It would be a great idea  but is it possible technically? Like doing a spongy layer of the banana  and you open it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  but do you see that as a rigid thing  or like like a banana  something very soft  you can open like banana  or. Yeah. So  I dunno what you think  Bob  but it would be great for users I think  and very good for marketing. Yeah. Yeah. Um. And setting buttons hidden in. Mm  other remarks  or something  or. Something we didn't talk about yes yet  or. I think we are almost there. Uh maybe  how can we  if we have a soft thing  like this  and to open it we have to attach it somewhere  I dunno how to do that technically  or. And how Yeah  maybe. Ma magnetic oh. Okay. Okay. And what would be the matter here of the first layer I mean? Mm. Likes. Soft plastic  or Yeah  yeah  yeah. Hmm. And something we forgot  maybe  uh about the speech recognition system  are we going to use it  or not? It i Yeah  it seems feasible  and it would be something very great. So we have the de design  the a good shape  new and so on  and we have also the technology thing w will be. And even the easy to use thing  so it will be perfect. So we add also the speech recognition device. So  that great. We have decided everything. And think we are on a good way. So  um uh the next meeting will start in thirty minutes. Um  so uh the the Industrial Manager uh will uh will work on the look and feel design. The User Interface uh uh Mana uh Manager will work on the user interface device. And the the Marketing Expert will do the first project evaluation. So  I hope you can do that in thirty minutes. And uh  yeah  I uh I think you should work together  s you uh Hamed and Peter  to work uh in a in a first prototype  and uh more about the shape and so on and how you can manage to put everything together. And um as usual you will receive some specific instructions on. So thank you all everybody  and see you in thirty minutes. Hello. Okay. Okay  I'll start. Can you open my presentation  please. I'm number four. Trend. Yep. Can you pass the mouse  please. Oh okay  that's fine. Okay. Um so basically I just want to presented to you present to you some recent results we've had from um looking at uh um some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world. Um the fashion trends we got from talking to our our contacts in the fashion industry based in Paris and Milan. Um so f from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel  um as opposed to a functional look and feel  is our number one priority. Um fancy is is is is the  you know  highest priority. Secondly um that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative. Um so this is t number two priority but it's two times less important as the fancy criteria. Um and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the um is is important as well  but again two times less important as the technologically innovativeness of the remote control. From our f fashion people in Paris and Milan  um we've discovered that this year um fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes  shoes and furniture. So  I'm pretty confident that our remote control fits into the furniture category. And also um the feel of material this year um is expected to be spongy. Um so hopefully our remote control reflects that s in some way. Uh sort of um squishy. Um. Yeah soft  like a uh like a sponge. I don't know. Yeah. Um so in conclusion  we need a our remote control needs to be something that's really fancy  um has lots of technolog tech technology in it. Um somehow would be good to have it related to fruit and vegetables with a spongy feel. And that it's easy to use and from our last meeting our you know Fabian told us that w you know one of the requirements is that we have to reflect the look and feel of our of th the Real Reaction company. Um. That's it. Less important. So um fanciness first and then two ti you know  half as important as that is technology technology  and half important as technology is easy to use. So. Inch. So So Ca Can I ask a question. This seven inch T_F_T_ screen  how big is it in reality? So like that. That's quite big. Uh uh have we decided that we're gonna use this T_F_T_ screen? But I mean even even that is like this big. Yeah. You can cut the T_F_T_ screen. Okay  so Okay. So  what's the size of the device? Even from my perspective seven t seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still Is it Can you hold that  or? Yeah  a small c control that they can hold in hand. But is something that's seven centimetres square e easy to hold? Okay. So if we use s solar cells  um where is the sun if someone's watching T_V_ inside? Okay. Okay. It's it's quite innovative  yes. And if you watch T_V_ outside it's very useful. Which is the same area. Could you re could you redesign your board? Oh  five five centimetres by ten centimetres. Yeah. Mm  touch screen. So Well it's it's definitely the obvious choice  with the colour of our company. I mean what other what other fruit and vegetables Do you know of any any other fruit and vegetables that are yellow? Well I'd like a shaped screen. I think that's more important than saving a bit of money on on the T_F_T_ screen. Yeah  banana's good. Okay. I think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that  you know  to manipulate that to hav be a cover that you can pull off and I think for sure. Definitely. The softer the better. Yeah. We could use Velcro. Or uh ma maybe a magnetic thing. Yeah  I imagine some sort of vinyl thing. In a in a sort of a with a suede sort of feel. Maybe. Mm. So you're saying is it possible to have a solar cell and this removable cover and And a and a banana. Yeah. Okay. I think it's important. I think One of our p priorities is tech technology. And Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Hello. I s No  no  you you can start. Yeah. The second one. Could you please show the presentation number three. Yeah. Three. Yes. Just Could you please check if it is the first one or the second. Uh  n n no  it's the first one. The second one. Uh yeah. Okay. Okay. So I am going to talk about a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use. I think uh I think the feature easy to use is more important than being fancy  but okay  we can discuss about it uh later. Um generally  generally uh this remote control uh uh should be should be something  in my opinion  uh the first feature is just to be easy to use. So  the more frequent buttons should be larger  they should be placed in a good position uh uh inside the remote control. And uh s uh I can conclude like this  that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it. It should be we shouldn't need to es open a a t book and uh start reading and uh learning how to use this uh this uh remote control. Okay. So what I found out that uh as I said uh I think it's better to put uh more frequent uh uh uh ke uh buttons which are used more in the middle of the remote control  and they should be bigger in size. Uh the shape of remote control should be in a way which can which should be taken easily in hand. It should not be completely like uh a cube. It should be it should have round edge  so uh then it's easier. And maybe uh just like some toys  some joystick which is easier to take inside the hand. And uh also f uh uh m because because customers doesn't like to buy lots of battery  it should not uh consume lots of energy. Okay. And my personal p uh preference is uh  as I said  uh just putting this buttons in a special places and covered some buttons which are not used uh that much like settings button  like mobile phone. Usually some mobile phone cover the dialling number part  so we can cover these buttons which are not used or uh number buttons for the for the for the can channels  and just put uh volume change or s ch can uh channel change buttons uh uh in the remote control. And if the user needed to do some more complex task uh he he can open the cover and then change settings or something like this. Uh. And also uh I think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier. Not on remote control. I dunno if I can explain well. But uh just inside. For example  a sliding or rolling uh uh d uh stuff  if we put it inside then we can easily manipulate with uh thumb. So it can be another uh preference. And uh I dunno but uh I think usage of a speech recogn uh r recogniser can be good. I know that it consumes lots of energy  but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy. And I think it's good because it's something new and usually young people like something new. So it may not be very useful but because it's new  people may buy it. Uh I personally think there should be a big difference between uh between something. Otherwise they prefer to buy something which is coming from a famous company  or. Okay. That's mine. Mm-hmm. Well maybe it can have two shells  a hard shell inside and a spongy shell outside. Yeah yes. Mm. Uh. Yes. Maybe this. So but Mm-hmm. Yeah. Hmm. Mm. I think I think their being uh large or small is not important. The only important thing is to be able to take it in uh inside hand easily. So let's say an average size  okay  and it should not be very heavy also. And I prefer to is it shouldn't have a uniform shape  so in the middle it should be a little bit thinner  maybe maybe. So we c it's like like some joysticks. You can take uh some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it's it's designed for your f uh taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape. So the general shape should be like this. I think uh seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large. So uh seven not seven but let's say five by ten it's I think it's that's my opinion. It's easier. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Or uh or I don't know but I don't want to now invent something new  because we didn't discuss about it. So using some L_C_D_s we can touch  so we can remove uh keys and just uh having uh  I dunno the name  L_C_D_ responding to fingers. Touching the screen. Something like Mm like tactile. So But for now if we don't want to use such kind of screens I I think we using a a smaller screen is better  because A smaller s Okay. I think this is not good. Mm. Mm. Okay. Yeah  I think infra-red. Yeah  peeling of the banana. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Uh Mm-hmm. Yeah  some Something like a plastic cover covering uh some interface  U_S_B_ interface as in the in uh digital camera. If you see it's like peeling. You open a plastic cover and you see some U_S_B_ interfaces  some some interfaces for adaptor. So keys can be uh buttons can be covered like this  with a plastic cover and uh when uh and when you open this cover it's like peeling a banana. So  something like this. Yeah  yeah  yeah it's a lic like a plastic cover  so. Mm-hmm. Yes  yeah it's a good idea. Magnetic. Mm. Yeah or a Yeah it can is it can be a plastic cover uh sticking to the to the all the stuff like uh with magnetic p uh magnetic uh magnetic uh materials in the border  so it's it sticks like refrigerator door  completely. And when you try to open it  it will be opened easily. So you you can be sure that it will not be open while you're uh while while uh you are commonly using uh buttons on the banana. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yes  I think. I think so. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Hmm. What does it mean  spongy? Like soft  or something? Okay. I will see. Okay. I think the biggest struggle will be the easy to use feature. We'll see. Exactly. Uh okay  so good news from me uh uh for me from Hamed  but bad news from Bob obviously  because spongy design  I don't like it as Okay  so could you please  Fabien  open it. I'm person two. And which one  uh probably the first one. I'm not sure but check the first one. I Most of the things I have to write myself on the board  but Yeah  that's it. Just It's only this slide? Yeah. This this is just uh one thing I wanted to mention and show you that I just uh I just found this  that our company uh developed a s a seven f seven fingers or I'll just Yeah  seven seven inch T_ T_F_T_ screen  which is good news for us  since we wanted to include a display there. Uh so I I probably draw it down raw scheme. This is this is the stuff that I can use to Okay  so the this will be like the overall scheme or overall requirements from the engineering point of view. Uh first thing is uh this will be the overall shape  no uh I'm not speaking about the real shape of the device  but the shape of the inside of the device. So there will be some circuit uh for the power. So  say power circuit here. Uh the main energy will be taken from batteries that we can uh uh And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there  we must use additional source of energy  which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can uh supply everything. I was computing all the all the things related to the speech recognition  and it's okay to use just uh two batteries and solar cells  so. So no problem. There can be also solar cell. Uh the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres  so this is my like hard requirement for the guys from the design. So at least seven to seven. It depends where you put your screen  because the screen is uh seven inch  so it depends on you where where you put it. It doesn't matter. Um it's just one cord from from the main board to the screen which can be elsewhere. So this will be T_F_T_. And on the main board we have the um interface to the microphone  which is somewhere  say here. Interface to the microphone. Then the graphical card uh for the T_F_T_ and the third unit is the I_R_. The good news is that we can uh we decided to use the infra-red unit because our company has also developed the chip for communication by the infra-red  including all the stuff inside  so it will be very cheap for us. So infra-red here. So the once again the overall requirements  seven to seven centimetres for the board  which has to be which can be spongy but has to be this size  and the T_F_T_ which is seven inches. Um I have to check what I wanted to Uh from my point of view I don't care about the about the material used for the overall des uh ov all the device. A all these things in in uh in this box are okay to put in in any shape  basically. But we have to take care of the T_F_T_. Well  sponginess. Maybe it a good feature  since it takes if it's around the T_F_T_ then it's good  because it's just keeps it safe  I dunno. Well  it's maybe related to the U_I_. A Yeah  that's all from me. Yeah? Well  seven to seven inches. Yes. Yeah but To be honest  I was Yeah  honestly speaking I was thinking that it was seven centimetres initially  but it's seven inches. But I I think we can we can cut it. Yeah  no no problem  because because because then the size of the graphic card will be one fourth. So Yeah  but no problem to to me to cut the screen. So so for the same price we have four screens now. Ah well this is like this is almost nothing. Seven to seven to at least well some three millimetres or something. Yeah  but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that  you know. Because if it's t too small we can we can lose it  at home  you know. I thought that it it should fit in the hand or something. W I I think so. I if the roller buttons are on the side you don't have to catch it like that  but just like this  and you know follow follow Well  that's that's no task for me  but well seven to seven at least yeah  but Oh  okay. Okay thanks. Not J uh just a point to the energy th things. If we use the batteries  and the additional so solar cell  then it's okay for L_ uh speech recognition and L_C_D_  so no problem in energy  I think. But we have to use the solar cell. Otherwise not. Yeah I was thinking just common A_A_ cells. So like three to five centimetres  I dunno exactly  but. S Uh d doesn't need to be sun. It it's just the daylight  you know. Yeah well I I suppose that I suppose that uh that this remote control won't be in the in the room like this  where there is light only when when there are people  but. Yeah from the T_ I don't think it's enough  uh. Ah it's a it's a compromise  no? Yeah  that's why I wanted to to include the speech recognition  because you wanted all the new things. Uh the s the screen is okay  but the board  uh that's the problem. Well what what would you guess as a shape? Or what what would be the shape? Mm. Okay. Okay. Five to ten. Well that Yeah  right. Yeah  I think it's feasib Well one um um How could we do it? We could put the board next to  well  under the L_C_D_ and for example make the L_C_D_ be totally unrelated to the thing that you hold in your hand. Like holding something  and the L_C_D_ to be just on top of it  you know somehow. Well But maybe let's stick to the s spongy thing  like one unit. Well fi five to ten it would be feasible. Okay  so five to ten  I I think it's it's feasible. I'll make it. Fo Five by ten. Mm-hmm. Okay  so Yeah  so so just just give me the the the five by ten numbers that you find the best and send it me and I will work it out. Hmm. Seven to ten banana. Okay. Rather mango or something or. You mean banana. Well  but If it's If it If the banana is big enough. Then  yes. But if you want to look at the screen  no. Well Well  it can be whatever you want. But if it's square then we get four screens out of one by cutting just. But if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches  so. It's like more more expensive to have shape like that. But I don't care. You know  if we fit this requirement. Okay Yeah  m maybe the banana could be like a bit uh fatter than than the c c common one. But Like modified banana  okay. Well it we'll stick to banana  or? Okay. Mm-mm. Yeah  yeah. Sure. Like like peeling of the banana you s It would be cool  yeah. Peeling of the banana  you know  should should discover the other buttons  which are hidden. First layer obviously spo Yeah  w It's it's like silly  but the people will really appreciate it  yeah I think. Well is it possible to make it soft? So I think if it's so then it's cool? Cool. Honestly speaking  I cannot imagine it  so far  but it will be terrible. Mm. Pof. Well since since the since the things like the like the screen and um how to say that  solar cell has to be has to be like kept kept in the shape  we cannot b uh So we need that the that the peeling uh I dunno but we should we should take care of these two two things. So  if if uh the solar cell won't be visible while the banana is closed  then the material must be able to put the light inside  you know. So that we can reach the energy out of it out of that. It is possible  but  well if it I dunno. I dunno how to how to do it if if t if to if it's better to put the solar cell to the t to the peeling or outside it  or or inside. But then it must be some window there  you know. Yeah. I agree. Okay. Okay. ,The project manager opened the meeting. The user interface designer and industrial designer presented the prototype design. The remote has buttons for power  mute  teletext  volume and channel up/down  and nine numbered channel buttons. The group discussed what buttons would be needed to enter channels 10 and above. They discussed adapting the docking station so it could be used with other products but did not make a decision. The remote is plastic with different coloured rubber strips on the sides and rubber buttons. The marketing expert led the product evaluation. The group were generally satisfied with the design but did not think the remote was technologically innovative. The overall score was 2.6. The group worked out the manufacturing costs. The group had problems figuring out the cost of the docking station and buttons  and did not know which kind of chip to use. They discussed using kinetic energy to make the remote more technologically innovative but decided against it. They eventually decided that they could not afford a docking station. They did not have time to evaluate the project process before the end of the meeting. 
Alright  yeah. crack on. Okay so we'll start off with a quick overview of the minutes. I think to sum up the last meeting  would be to say um the requirements that we've um set out. Those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on uh a small joystick  L_C_D_ and a couple of other buttons for navigation um with power being I suppose one of the main single purpose buttons. Um we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter with any luck  the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design um looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck. Um that pretty much sums up the last one. So we'll just crack on  um like to maybe start with the Industrial Designer if it's possible. Um uh the con today is the concep today. This uh meeting is the conceptual design phase and is um Sorry about this.. And is to cover things like um what the parts might be made of  um  can we uh outsource these from elsewhere  um will we have to construct any items ourselves? Yeah  okay well I'll just uh I'll load it up then. Um. Which one do y Oh  interface concept? That's you. We've got trend watching  that's you. Components design. Okay. Okay. Okay. Now  the kinetic one  we've 'cause that's the ones where like you the movement causes it. Um the bat uh the battery for a a watch wouldn't require a lot of power  would be my one query. Is a kinetic one going to be able to supply enough power? Do you think? W Which I suppose as well would allow us to go off the shelf again  you'd say? Um. Um. Curious. Um  I don't know if you'd be able to off the top of your head or not  the single curved and double curved  would you be able to give an example? Um could you maybe draw something? I you don't doesn't have to be perfect  it's just 'cause I'm not quite sure if I understand the difference between the two. So it might literally just be okay. Alright. Mm. Okay  that was definitely something we can talk about. Um so you've got a little bit about the the chip that we might require as well? Um  do you have any idea so far  like when we're saying that we'd need an advanced chip for an L_C_D_  does that in shoot the cost up by a drastic amount? Or? Well I think compared to say just pressing buttons. if you press a button that sends a certain transmission through the infra-red  whereas I think if we're controlling the L_C_D_ we definitely require a much more powerful chip. Just compared to the chip you would use for pushing buttons I think is the the point being made. If I've not over-stepped. Yeah? Okay  um should I go on  or go back? Well we'd also be relying on the um the bulk buying in producement and such. I assume. We have to look into the costs of those. So  sorry. Okay. Okay. Um.. So in the information that you've been supplied  how feasible would you say that the idea of using an L_C_D_ looks? Um I mean that sounds like quite a good requirement to me. Um conventional battery would seem to make sense. Um I'm not sure if there's any cost differences between single and double curved and I'm I don't know about anybody else  but plastic or rubber as a traditional form of casing would seem to be a good way forward?. Okay. Okay  well um Yeah  well will we move on to user interface  and yeah? Um sorry  as long as were you? Yeah. Okay. Um and d d d interface concept. Yeah. Can I just jump in slightly there? That would suggest the double curved design's probably going to be most appropriate  then. okay. Mm. Okay. Um  yeah. Just to let you know we'll probably be quite tight for time as well  because I think you've probably got a lot you'd like to say  I guess. Okay. Excellent  right. Um uh. File open. Trend watching. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Well  um I would say that the most you could probably hope for is gaining a year's lead on most people anyway. You always have to bring out new designs  so if we can get next year then that's possibly a good place to start anyway. Um. Seems like a a lot of the components could be off the shelf  so I don't exactly what cost would be incurred. Um I can see your point about the number keypad  but I've I would say that we can probably incorporate it into the menu system if you need to do traversal of a large number of channels. My feeling would be that even if at a later date this was to be taking control of um boxes as well um having the use of the L_C_D_ and the joystick would probably allow you to manipulate enough channel numbers for you to be Mm-hmm. Okay. So what it looks like to me is we'll use a large number of standard components  um  say something like um lithium ion battery  the kind that you find in most um small hand held devices now. Um Looks like we going for a double curved design. Um I don't know what cost implications there are in that. Um  looks like we're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber. Though I'd have to say depending on how flexible it is  we might need to have some kind of inner frame. Do you think there's any way we could maybe remove the articulation? I can see why it looks appealing  but it could be a weak point in um the structure  do you think? That would be a worry of mine. Yeah  we won't add that functionality. However  one interesting point is  I don't know how serious you were there  but we if we take some of the ideas why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo? I dunno. It's an certainly a different colour from your average um That's true. Was there anything in your research Mm-hmm. An interesting point is that if the person doesn't have the computer  we can still make the process easier because instead of having to look up codes  maybe we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the L_C_D_ and then they maybe look up different names of um different actual units that have been produced. Or we have the remote control just go through them until it's like does this do the correct function  and such. Doesn't have to be used very often that's right  yeah. Okay  this just to give us a rough idea of what we're meant to be doing for the next stage. I'm pretty sure that you got that anyway. This is the conceptual one. Um. I think we've come up I think we've covered everything we need to here. Um I think we've decided on what  you know  decided on standard items for most of um rubber and such  so we're now looking at the detailed design and what we need to be doing for the next meeting. Um So for example  um I'll just start at the top  you've got yourself and the Industrial Designer gonna be working quite closely at this stage 'cause it'll be hard not to  obviously. Um looking from prototyping of some des description using clay. Um I suppose you'll be told a lot more about that as uh progress. Um The user interface design  They're kind of it looks they're the idea I've pushed forward so far is maybe more of a physical one there  whereas possibly be more interested in maybe how the L_C_D_'s going to incorporate  do you think? Or do you s perceive that most the design design decisions still need to be based on the physical layout? Mm-hmm  that's very true. Um. Okay. Um got product evaluation as well. Um. I I think we'd be yeah  no  it'd be more a case of how do we envisage us performing the product evaluation once we have a model to test with. Um so it'd be a case of do you think that just bringing users in to have them test it out  uh maybe putting a certain number of products into the field in certain places which I suppose is quite similar. Or just kind of hitting the streets and you know saying this is a new remote control  what do you think of the look of it? Um I think the target audience is pretty much anybody under the age of say maybe sixty or something ludicrous. Um the reason I'm saying that is we're just looking at a a replacement remote control  something that's stylish  so maybe you're even just maybe you're narrowing down your target audience simply by saying if they're buying it that often or they're maybe looking to replace something then  they've got a bit of free cash  so that puts them potentially in the younger age bracket. Maybe even single  just for the reasons of um uh excess cash flow. Although of course I mean at twenty five Euros  I don't think we're looking at charging the earth for the uh device. Think that's well within the normal bracket. Um your idea of the U_S_B_ would I think would largely depend on the cost. U_S_B_'s definitely one of the cheapest interfaces out there  but it might push the cost of the overall unit up 'cause it would require not just the connection but the chip for communicating with the rest of the system. That one might have to be based on The the idea was that maybe it could connect up for um allowing a software interface on the P_C_ for a larger programming due to the fact that we've gone for such a nice  easy minimal design  normally. Um. It's just for T_V_  but for programming it to use your T_V_  you might hook it up to the P_C_. I I'm not sure  but I'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of the U_S_B_ might be prohibitive. We don't know unless it would make sense to. Mm-hmm. W It would make sense to. I would say to. Um and we'd better be careful about the time as well. We've already had the five minute warning  so. Um. I would say yeah. International would make sense. Um you're gonna look at product evaluation. I'm I'd better start writing up a hell of a lot of crap. Um you're gonna look a bit more at the kind of the physical make up you say. Um looks like we're gonna need a maybe a kind of prototype in clay. Uh we'll see how that goes. Um. So um do I think we've got an idea of where we need to go for the next meeting  would you say? Yeah  I would s that would be my my feeling. We seem to have quite a general consensus that the idea of the the r rubber could be quite Yeah. So we always need to remember that somewhere we're meant to be getting the slogan on. Possibly I'm think I'm not sure but I'm seeing a little bit of space around maybe the joystick area which could be used. Um. Okay. And I think that says it all really. Right. See everybody in a half hour. Uh uh okay. I'll just Uh I have a presentation I just saved it in the uh the folder. Uh. It's uh Components design.. Alright. So Uh. The case uh le that's what I wrote first of all  could be plastic our plastic. Uh but later on we found out that um it can be rubber as well  or titanium or even wood. So uh we decide what it's gonna be. Probably plastic. Uh we need the infra-red transmitter. Get that off the shelf. Uh joystick we'll probably if we're gonna use it  um could be plastic w or rubber even as well. Um if you go on to the next slide. Uh If you go on to f uh findings  it's like two or three slides down. Right. So  this is what I found we can use. Uh three different types of batteries. Um can either use a hand dynamo  or the kinetic type ones  you know that they use in watches  or else uh a solar powered one. Um. Yeah. Uh. Yeah  I don't think it would. Um. And solar cells  I dunno about that. Uh. We should probably just use conventional batteries. Um  just like in usual remote controls. Um. Yeah. Um. And these are three different types of or two different types three different types of shapes you can have. Uh one is a flat one  and then more original ones are single curved one or one with a double curved. Um the materials are tha there as you can see  but uh you can't have a titanium one for a double curved  uh which would be Yeah  and light. Uh  i think so as well  yeah. They make mountain bikes out of that  don't they. So it's really light as well. Um. T yeah. Uh. Well for a curved  well I was thinking to f for to sit in your the palm of your hand. Uh maybe like this  with the uh joy pad here. Joystick here. And maybe um an okay button around here  so that the thumb can uh use it quite easily. Um I don't exactly Double curved. It probably means this is probably double curved. Uh whereas a single curved would be like that. I guess. Or not necessarily. Yeah like that. Whereas this is two curves. Um so I guess that's what they mean by uh double curve. Um which obviously it looks better than the single curve  but uh you can't have it in titanium  which is uh a nice material. Uh and for the buttons  um it can have the scroll wheel which they use in mouses for com P_C_s. Uh but um it requires a more expensive chip to use  and if you wanna use L_C_D_ it's even more expensive. So you have to decide  there's trade-offs there. Um if you want the buttons to be oh yeah  if you have a double curve uh control and it's rubber  then you have these rubber buttons as well. But you're gonna ha I reckon you're gonna have to have uh key a number keypad anyway for the amount of channels these days. You wouldn't want to just have to scroll through all the channels to get to the one you want. You wanna enter just the number of it  if you know it. So um I reckon we're gonna have to have a number keypad anyway. Do you think? Yeah. So  depends where gonna spend the money if you want the f fancy L_C_D_ display. Yep. Yeah i Um Uh the previous slides just explain what's in the internal components of the uh remote control. If you go to the one before that uh so it just says what it does  translate the key press into an infra-red signal and this is received by the T_V_. Uh the chip just needs to detect the signal or detect the key press and then uh it'll send it to the tr the amplifier. And uh then the next slide just shows how the uh copper wires uh interact with the buttons  the rubber buttons  uh to uh get sent to the chip. So that's just how the control works inside. Um we have to decide on what buttons we're gonna use.. Um I think we can do it if uh we use conventional batteries and not have solar cells or kinetic. Um and then maybe use single curved uh case. Because we might need it to be curved for the uh thumb to use the joyst joystick easily. Um and then you'll need the advanced chip obviously for the L_C_D_. Yep I'm finished. Ah  okay. Oh yeah  I forgot to mention that. The uh rubber material is the type of stress ball material  not just normal rubber. Forgot to say that. Yeah. If you're going with the fruit and veg thing  looks like a banana. F if you wanna design it that way. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. monkey. The U_S_B_ for which? Oh right  okay. But didn't they just say it's just for T_V_  or are we gonna Okay  yeah. they're going with the fashion thing  like the design  spongy rubber. Yeah. Uh. Cost is Yeah. Yeah. yeah. Titanium  the really strong metal  titanium? Is it not also it's expensive? Two curves. Need an advanced chip for the L_C_D_. Is that did I Advanced  like three eight six advance. Okay. Okay  sure. Mm  if we only have twelve Pounds fifty  twelve Euros  not even twelve Pounds. Twelve Euros  what's that  like eight pounds or something like that  nine Pounds? Okay  that's good point. I also have a preference for rubber. Based on my research. digital. Is this the joystick? Okay. Mm. Mm. 'Kay. We go. Okay. So uh to gather my research  two basic methods. We compared uh whether people want the remote control to do a lot of stuff or they want it to look cool. And then we we research uh fashion trends in Europe  what's what's the new black  you know  as it goes. Next slide please. Uh we found  in order of importance  people want the remote control to look cool more than they want it to to be cool. As in they want it to do a lot of good s they want it to look like it does a lot  and if it does do a lot that's a bonus  but they don't care so much  you know. They want it to be that's sounds a bit like a contradiction. Technology technical technologically innovative. People want it to be that  but s still they care more about the way it looks than what it does. So like the interface is really important. And easy to use  it it just so happens that uh from the second point to the third point is twice as important I mean the second point is twice as important as the third point. People want it I is it has to be cooler than easy to use  you know  if it has the newest features  even if it's difficult to use  prefer it to have the newest features. And if it's easy to use that's a bonus. The fashion  now this is seems a bit odd to me  but fruit and veg is the new is the new black for furniture  for clothes  for shoes. How that relates to a remote control I don't know. But I I see I come on to that in the next in the next slide. Spongy. I've als I've been saying everything's the new black. Well spongy's the new black as well. So we have the choice between rubber and plastic. If it's the type of rubber that you can squeeze  you know  it's spongy  then can I skip the rest? Okay. Okay  so kinda spongy material. So um so my personal opinion? Um we want something fancy and techni technologically innovative  obviously. But what we what we need is something that looks like it's from the future that looks cool  that's that's different  you know  that's everyone has a white remote control  black remote control  you need something cool. Like  titanium is cool but it's expensive. And maybe it's a bit of overkill for a remote control. Um now the fruit and veg options  either we we go in that direction or we stay totally away from it. Um I mean the research did come up with fruit and veg  so maybe it is important for it's the up to the interface guy. So if we stay away from it  s you know stay away from it  but if we're gonna go along with it then it doesn't necessarily have to be like an apple or something like that  or a kiwi fruit. It could be something like  I say potato peeler but I'm sure you guys have a have a much cooler idea than I do. So I think cool is the key. Few questions about a spongy remote control. I've never seen one before. I've seen plastic remote controls. I think maybe they were I don't know  back in the day when they first came up with remote controls  they had a reason for it being sturdy  you know. For being strong and sturdy. So um if we want something strong and sturdy  I say stay with plastic or titanium  but if we go with spongy  we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want  it doesn't matter  it's spongy material  it's not gonna break  you know. I just don't know how the L_E_D_ and the lights are gonna fit into a spongy material because it's not gonna be completely squeezable. So how do things fit it? And if we are gonna use spongy  we can say it's long lasting  you know it's damage resistant and stuff like that  so. So just to summarise  people want stuff that's cool  that's that looks like it's cool  and if it is cool then that's a bonus doesn't have to be um people like fruit and veg. We can either go down that alley or stay totally away from it. People like spongy material. If we're gonna use spongy material we have to think of how practical it is  and how we can further promote that idea. And also  this was this year. So  things change all the time  every year you know they they always talk about this year  this is the new black. Well next year something else is gonna be the new black and we're stuck with last year's fruit and veg type stuff. 'Kay. That's me. That's a good point. You can incorporate names into the menu. Okay. Even news  music. Like they do on uh sky digital kinda. Yeah.. Okay. Course not. Sure  yeah. Sure. The noise for when you lose the banana  um f yeah  for when you lose the remote control  it could be like a a monkey noise or something like that  rather than a standard beep beep. Y you know  you lose the monkey the banana  y you lose the banana  you press a button  and you hear like monkey screams or something like that to direct you towards the banana. S oh  I was gonna talk about the programmable remote control. Now I think it'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all T_V_s  you know you s you click a button and it finds the frequency that works with your particular television. But why you'd need to program it like as as a standard feature  I I don't know. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That's because televisions  they don't give the remote control any type of feedback when you send it. Okay. Is it is it actually a book of names to digits  or is it like a few pages? I was just thinking  if we were to store this information  some type of mapping. This person probably need to use this feature like once  you know  when you first buy the remote control  or whenever they buy a new television  so once every s Yeah  and it's Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah  you see I don't some of these things kinda logically follow the others. How can t product evaluation  doesn't that come after actually seen a product prototype. Oh  that's the okay  sure sure sure. Mm-hmm. Okay  sure. At this stage we still have no no target audience or 'Kay. And it's stylish. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yep. Okay. Programmable memory as well. For the remote control. We've w definitely talking some type of Different. But you're gonna need some type of flash memory or something. Well something that doesn't you wouldn't have to redo the whole thing once the batteries are changed  you know  once you turn off the power. Yeah. Different languages  uh different skins and stuff like that. Sure. I if it was customisable as in different languages and stuff  that does open it is supposed to be international  right? So. It would make sense if you could Okay. Yeah. The fruit and veg. This one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. I mean we are trying to promote a remote control  but we wanna keep the company brand as well  so. I think so too. Sa Yeah  that's me. Mm. There's also a watch moves around a great deal more. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Um I'm actually gonna be bold and go oo go straight for rubber um for reasons I'll go into uh in more detail.. Mm. Yep. Now I'm gonna have to work between the uh the slides and the uh and the white board 'cause I actually I have some fairly concrete things this time. Uh um I was given a an H_T_M_L_ file giving um various ideas from uh from other previous remote control designs  and pretty much decided to just dump them all. I wasn't very impressed by them and they didn't seem to re uh nothing I saw seemed to meet the sorts of design specifications that we're going for today. Um so what I ra rather than looking at other remotes  uh ra oomp be better to simply look at the human hand. Um and try and f um and try and figure out a way of laying out the elements we've already decided on  um so that if r a if so that the finger is e each finger or thumb is wherever it needs to be already. Um so uh next slide  if you please. Um and what we've basically decided on was the the um the joy uh the joystick  two function buttons and the L_C_D_  just keep it paired down to the absolute minimum. I don't actually think we need the um the numeric keypad because if you m because one of the menus that we could have available um v via via the L_C_D_ is one where you scroll through channels  so if there's something f and be bear in mind since this isn't meant to work for um f f f for di for digital or um or for or for cable  whatever  you're basically looking at four or five terrestrial channels  and then um your V_C_ uh and then the channel through your V_C_R_ and or D_V_D_ player. And or um box. So it's not I'm not really excessively concerned about that. You must have two two modes  basic mode  where um the joystick's uh left right left right for channels  up down for volume  um and the uh uh and the menu mode for uh further functions. Um now the reason I was particularly interested in using rubber for this is that if we're going to have a highly ergonomic design  um it needs to be ergonomic for left or right handed people. Um  so you Mm-hmm. Yes  absolutely. Um  basi basically what I basically what the what be having um  I would say  the the whole thing articulated at two points  so that if you if you're handing it from a lef uh left or right handed user you can adjust it so that the um the L_C_ the L_C_D_ and the uh The joystick would be in the right place. And also this is a rather nicer de uh design gimmick that the the um you know the whole thing you know it should have sort of organic feel to it that it should be  you know  soft to touch and can be moved around all nice. Um okay on to on to the next uh to the next slide. Okay. Yeah  'kay basically um I can add pretty pictures to this. The um Assuming the hand the hand to be in about sort of this position  um hol uh holding the remote  the um the joystick unit should rest over the uh the joint of the f of the uh four finger so that it's directly accessible for the thumb. Um and it would need t there would need to be a it would need to be articulated just below that so that it could be switched around for uh left or right handed users. So. You then have a grip section that can be more or less the same irrespective of handedness. You just have big two big buttons that cover most of the area so it can in the upper part  one for the four finger  one for the middle finger. Um  and that Th this part here is the joystick. This would be the actual grip. Probably where you'd want to have the battery as well. That would be probably the bulkiest part. And you then have  at the uh at the bottom  the L_C_D_  and this would need to be articulated as well. And basically I'd want this to rest here  right at the base of the wrist. So it would fit just nicely in the hand. And again  this part could be rotated  so it can So so so that it can be adjusted to either left or right handed user. Um So the t uh the top function button in basic mode would be the on off switch and menu mode would be the enter button. And then the bottom function buttons switches between between modes. Um now programming it actually thi this is one thing I've found with um the replacement remote control. Programming them can be a right pain. So I thought th the simplest way around that would be to have um a cable to connect it to the computer some some fair iv fairly fairly simple software on the computer just so that you on your computer just so that you could um pr program it at a rather in a rather more comfortable interface. And you could download programs for it from uh for uh T_V_s from all sort of main manufacturers. Um though you i it would be necessary to have uh have a m uh have a ha have a mode for programming it without the computer  uh just in case there are there are still people left out there who don't have them yet. Um. But uh. Yeah. That's that's my idea. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah  actually if you've got a lot of channels  the number keypad can be quite annoying as well  becau it's you know if you're trying to remember what uh  you know  what number's the discovery channel or whatever. It's just irritating. But if you h but but but if you have a me but if you have a menu structure  then you can sub-group them. So you Yeah. Yeah  I I would say definitely  I mean I mean I mean the the idea of having it sort of articulated i th there would be basically two points of articulation. W um one below and one above the m the uh the main sort of grip. So Mm. I d I don't thi I don't think that it would be a a structural weakness  I mean if you have a firm s sub-structure  you can then incorporate articulation into that. If you then have a sort of outer skin of mm flexible  spongy rubber then you have something that is you know very much you know organic  and I think would look rather co I mean mi rather cool. I mean my drawing there doesn't doesn't do it justice  it makes it makes it look more a little bit more like a vibrator than a than a uh than a remote control  but uh. Mm-hmm. Make it harder to lose  as well. I th uh I mean if it I think that's something that could perhaps be programmable  though maybe have monkey as default. Um. Mm-hmm. Well basi basically the um for f for uh I mean e each manufacturer will have a partic will have a particular command set that uh the T_V_ responds to. It's not simply a matter of frequency. So um usually what's done is you have this big booklet full of different possi you'll have all of them sort of programmed in to the uh remote  and you'll have this little booklet of codes you then find your um ma uh find your manufacturer and try the different codes that come under that manufacturer's name 'til you find the right one. It's Yeah  that's right. So that's that's quite annoying and we probably would still have to do that. But if we had um some sort of hook-up to your computer as an option  then if you've got a computer you can avoid that rather irritating thing. Yeah. Yeah. Um booklet. Some pages. Yeah. Yeah. But it's a but it's a nuisance. And it's a nuisance very close to the to um to actually purchasing it  so it's something that you're likely to be thinking about. If you if there's w i if there's one in the shop that's that says it can avoid much of that nuisance  you might be favourably inclined towards it. Um mm. Mm. Um well I I think other than ge getting a sort of more aesthetically pleasing form for it  um mo most of the sort of layout design decisions are are made  I would say. Um but then again  the um the menu structure to to a considerable extent that's gonna vary according to the model of television  and also any customisations that the user might wish to incorporate. So um and one of the nice things about having an L_C_D_ and a menu structure is that there is that flexibility to it. Yeah. Mm. Yeah  I mean it's Yeah. Yeah. The other thing I mean it I mean it would need to ha it would need to have um some sort of on board memory anyway. Um f for one for one thing because I do think that the menu system should be um uh I mean although you know  it's not going to be terribly complicated if it's just controlling one device  the menu system ought to be um o ought to be customisable and uh Mm-hmm. How uh how uh how you want say the um the the menu structure for flicking through channels if you've got lots of channels. That sort of thing. Yeah. Are we going to be supplied with the clay is what I want to know. Where is the clay? Mm-hmm. Mm. I th I think I would largely want to actually steer clear of the whole sort of fruit and veg thing. Bu but um but the spongy idea I like. I like it a lot. I having it i having it sort of br bright yellow I think that's quite a good idea  though maybe we could have options for colours as well. and again this has the advantage of being harder to lose. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. I was like like I said before I I think we should have the R_R_ on the uh on the top function button. ,The project manager opens the meeting by going over the minutes of the last meeting  detailing the main points of each person's presentation. They do the prototype presentation which includes a model of the remote control. The group discusses this proposed model  approving of the small size and look of it. They goes over finances and are pleased to find that they are well within budget. However  while the marketing expert is doing the product evaulation the group realizes that they neglected to calculate voice recognition into the financing. Their cost had been 8.20 Euros and they have  4.30 left to cover it  so they decide to settle for whatever quality it will buy. They rate their product on its shape  size  color  feel  and functionality. They discuss the project process  talk briefly about adding more features  and one member suggests eliminating a mute buttons and include a diffferent feature. They are happy with the creativity  leadership  and teamwork within the group  and close the meeting by thanking one another. 
Hi. Oh. Good morning. I'm Juergen Toffs. I'm the User Interface Designer. Ach. Ooph. Very artistic. Okay. Wow. He does have body uh Huh. You don't have to change the colour and the pen width during uh the drawing. Or You have to draw uh push hard on the pen or uh Oh. Uh hmm. Okay. Oh. It's a very bloody cat. It's a frog. Uh it's an apple. A dog? Huh? Oh  it is a turtle. It's uh inside its shell. You'll be uh finished sooner. Wow. Yes. Okay. Wha Thank you. Yeah. Um How did it work? Performance? And a pen? Um Well  very good. I just uh thought I'd pick the easiest one. Well  we had a dog  a few years ago. And and it  yeah  when it died we didn't get a new one or something. But uh Uh a Graphical User Designer  so Hey. Oh. No. Can work together. Ah colour. Well  it's okay. Yeah. Uh-oh. Oh  he is the artistic design. Remote control animal. Well with the interface  it might be easier to ha to draw here and display there uh. Than on the  with Yeah  I m I mean like uh like on here  drawing drawing uh. And then displaying on screen  but Too expensive  yeah. A green rabbit. There  the g white green rabbit. He's a little bit stoned there. Yeah  how much is it? Hundred million uh remotes or something? Oh yeah. Um well I think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels. And my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible. Uh Is it possible to open pen drawings in this uh on this screen? Uh but um which The ones we made on the Oh  only in Word  okay. For what purpose? We And and the price. Okay. And him. Yeah. Um one thing uh  we must first agree on uh what we're going to m going to make. Do we Are we going to use um it it for multiple systems? Or uh We should have some agreement on that before we Okay. Ah okay. Consensus on the  what we're gonna do. Yeah. Well yeah  if the technical functions have to be designed  I I've gotta know for what kind of machines they will be. Or do we use it a text screen? Or uh will it be with uh with bluetooth or Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Sorry. Yes. Yeah. No. Come up. Hi. Morning. Hi  my name's uh. I'm the Industrial Designer. By the way  why was your cat uh red? Oh  okay. Oh  yeah  sure. No  it's a turtle. Must be a dog. Yeah. Uh. Hmm. Yeah  sure. Uh thanks. I figure I should do something like that  but I'm gonna do something much more difficult. Exactly. Uh Yes. No. No. Yeah  exactly. So. Uh I figured this is a pretty b good impression of a rabbit. Uh uh Uh well. Where does the pen go? Just uh Uh I figured the rabbit was actually the most uh impressive. Oh  sorry. Twenty million. Two million  oh yeah  two million. Yeah. And and him. I figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually. Yeah. Yeah  actually it is. Then looking at individual components  so that's actually a f step further. Yeah  we can take it from there. Yeah  I agree uh  we can take it from there. Or edit. Okay  cheers. Good morning. By Big Brother? Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Of our faces. I'm uh Tim. Um my function is the Marketing Expert. Speaks for itself. I have a question. Um this exercise  um did the company board tell you to do it  or uh did you just make it up yourself? It's part of the introduction  okay. Okay. Um  yeah. I don't know really how it works. But maybe you can show us first? You g you get electrocuted or It's like Pictionary? The the one who says it first gets a raise. It's a pork? Mm yeah  I have it at home. What's it called? Ah. Miniature size? Okay. Okay. We have to speed up. Remember you use uh different colours  and different pen widths. I Okay. Save it. You have to save it. I've done it. New? 'Kay. Mm uh Not really. Um That one. Yeah? Okay. Open. Which one is it? Smart board? Okay. And now? Okay. Okay  thanks. 'Kay  I've speed up. 'Kay  that's fine. Line width. It's not an apple. Hmm. Colour. Something like this. Smaller. Um 'Cause I liked Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles. Uh? No  it's uh No no. It's coming up. Mm. Uh. Something like this. Okay  you know Very artistic. Yeah? Here you go. Uh the big lines were like nine. Uh  it's p It's pretty good uh An artist. Think you uh picked the wrong uh function. Wrong job. Wha That's enough  thanks. I wonder. I'm gonna design a remote uh remote control animal. Oh. Sorry. Yeah. That that might be easier. But at the other hand  uh a pen like that is easy to hold in your hand  and I think it's easier to draw. Yeah. With a pen than with a mouse mouse. Mouth. Oh  okay. Yeah. W with this paper it's too mu too expensive. It's a rabbit with uh broken legs? Yeah. It will do. Project Manager? Uh Have you been uh counting the time? Okay. Let's go on then. It's pretty abstract. Like how much? Yeah. Yeah. I think so. Uh but I have some points. Can I show them on the on the big screen? Maybe? Yeah. Yeah  I can find Uh. Screen? Okay. Okay  I have some uh points from marketing point of view. Um just the standard thing li things like uh intuitive  uh small  fairly cheap. Uh it's pretty cheap  twenty five Euros. Uh brand independent. Um I think  it doesn't have to matter uh which brand your T_V_ or other thing is. Um Five minutes? Okay  I'll wrap it up quickly. Um I personally think it has to be multi-purpose. Uh most of the remote c uh remote controls are uh just for one purpose. And uh by making it multi-purpose  it uh has a new feature  adds a new feature to the market  and distinguish from uh from current products. Um maybe some other technology than infrared. Uh I rather find it very annoying um  like when someone is standing in front of the T_V_ then you can't switch it. Um think about um sending it over radio waves or bluetooth. That might be a little bit uh expensive. Um And something like an L_C_D_ screen. Um uh like I said here um Maybe it's easy. It's nice as an added feature feature  that um  when you're on a certain channel  you can see on the L_C_D_ screen uh what programmes are coming up or From my point of view  yeah. Yeah  it has to be uh Yeah  our company is very uh good in making new innovative uh things. So i i i i To the current market. Look  you got some cheap uh remote controls there. They just uh Yeah  you got a dozen of 'em. But when you enter a new market with a remote control and uh wanna gain market share you have to do something special  I think. Yeah. Yeah  of course. But it's But but this is just from marketing uh aspect. I don't know anything about user interface or design. Mm uh I I don't think we have to be  we have to agree on that. Uh I think th that's a pha Yeah. That's a phase further. Ju just uh make some mock-ups  some some general ideas. And and then we can plan Yeah. We can plan further  I think. Mm yeah. I don't know. You decide. You're the Project Manager. Uh tha that's a same step further. Yeah. Uh. Yeah. Like we all have a list of uh things that has to b that have to be in it  or how it has to be like. And then in the next meeting we decide w what it's gonna be. A And then you s then you can delete uh the o the obsolete uh details. I think. Yeah. Yeah. Damn. Success? Hello. Good morning. Uh before I start with the with the meeting I have a few things to tell you about the the setting we're in  uh because we're uh being watched by uh Big Brother. So um Yeah. Yeah. This uh These are cameras  so are these. This thing uh that looks like a pie  are actually all microphones. So you must be careful with uh with uh all this. And uh as I can see you uh you have placed your laptops uh exactly on the place where it must be. And that has to do with the camera settings  so we don't have our uh laptops in front of the cameras. And Indeed. So they can see our faces. Okay. Welcome at the kick-off meeting. My name is uh Danny Wolfs. Uh this is the agenda for today. Uh first a little opening. Uh I will introduce myself  uh and uh I think it's very uh good to introduce uh yourself. Uh then uh a little bit of acquaintance  acquaintance to uh to to ourselves. So uh we get to know each other. Uh that will be done uh with a tool training from the he these two uh smart boards. Then the project plan. What we're going to do  and how we're going to do it. Uh and discussion about that and a little closing at the end. Okay uh  my name is uh Danny Wolfs. I'm the Project Manager. What's your name? User interface  okay. Industrial  yes. Okay  thank you. First a little about the project aim. Uh the the the aim is to make a new remote control. Uh maybe you have read uh read the website. It's a very uh  yeah  very uh ambitious uh company. They uh they wanna do something else. I w Uh there must be a new remote control. Uh first of all uh it must be original  uh and trendy. That's two things really uh close to each other. But at the same time uh user-friendly. And they have uh Yeah  that's uh very important uh for them. Uh there are three stages. There is a functional design. So uh what are we going uh to uh to do? What are we going to uh uh make f uh kind of functions in the remote? And why are we going to do it? Then the conceptual design. How are going to do it? And that's uh really global. Uh because at the detailed design  how  part two  uh we go uh to dig in uh really about how the the te the technical of If it's uh it's possible technical-wise. Uh each stage is uh uh is broken up in two uh two stages  individual work and a meeting. So it's uh it's very straightforward. Okay  the tool training. We have two smart boards. This one is for the presentations  the PowerPoint presentations or the Word presentation of whatever you uh you had. Uh and this is uh only for uh drawing. So uh we uh must let it uh stand on this uh this programme. This is called a smart board thing uh Yeah  it speaks for itself. Um and as you uh may have heard  the documents in the shared folder uh can be uh showed on this screen. Not in y the the My Documents. So if you wanna show something  put it in the shared folder. Uh This uh is very straightforward  with the save  the print  the undo  the blank  the select  the pen. Well  I don't uh gonna explain it all  because I think you know uh how it works. Um we must not forget uh everything we draw on here  uh all must be saved. We we may not delete anything. So uh if you have uh drawn something  save it. Never delete it. That's a very important uh thing. Okay. Uh little uh little kinda exercise to uh know each other. At uh the white board on the left. Every uh every one of us uh must draw our favourite animal  and uh tell uh tell us why we uh had uh chosen that animal. Uh important is that we use different colours  and uh different pen widths. Widths. Widths. Yes? Yeah. No no no. It's uh it's uh I I I must do it. Yeah  yeah  yeah. 'Cause we uh really don't know each other  and uh it's kinda new. So getting used to each other  we can uh have a little fun then  before we uh dig in really to the hard stuff. That kind of thing. Would you start with drawing your uh favourite animal? Okay  okay. Yeah  okay. Drawing goes with uh this thing. Do not touch your hand on uh this little uh thingy here. That's uh important. So hold it uh like this. Yeah  kinda. So  um You must p p uh push a little uh Good. Because And uh wait uh wait a few seconds. It's not uh fully real-time  so uh watch it. Oh yeah. Well I'm gonna paint in the red. Oh. That's the background colour. Well  undo. Um The pen? No. One minute please. Yeah  that's the one. Well  five. Okay. My favourite animal huh? Yeah  you can guess what it is. May uh paint uh next. No  it's not an orc. You don't see it uh at the ears? You have an orc at home? Thank you. So it's a cat. Simba. 'Cause uh we have a cat at home and he's called Simba. 'Cause he looks like the uh the the lion from The Lion King. So we uh found it kinda cool to uh name it after a lion. He's happy with us  so uh he's smiling. No  only the face. Because we have we have twen twenty five minutes. So we uh Yeah. Yeah. Okay  who wants to go next? Yeah? So choose a colour  choose a pen width and draw a Yeah. Save it  okay. Kind of firm touch. Yeah. Because uh my cat is red uh at home. And I have red hair  so uh must be red. It is a turtle. Why a turtle? Why? Tim? You watched it a lot? You watched it a lot? It's a scared turtle. Okay  Tim. Thank you. Jurgen  you want to go next? Format? And then you have the the current colour  you can change. So no red or green. And uh line uh width. I had five. Tim had Uh Tim  what kinda line width did you have? Okay. It's a dog. Okay. Why a dog? You have a dog at home? Had a dog? Yeah? Ah. You have an artistic uh inner middle. So I think you can see it's real uh really a easy programme to use. Not difficult at all. Okay  thank you. Janus? The last one? Yeah. After a cat  a turtle and a dog. I think he's gonna draw an elephant. Uh-oh. No. Better to draw with a with But what is he uh? Is it a rabbit? Do you have a rabbit at home? Is it a white rabbit f It's the white rabbit from The Matrix. Okay  then yeah. Okay. Finishing touch and then we're going further. Yeah? Yeah  a little. Well  I think the dog is the the most uh artistic. Don't choose for youself. That's selfish. Okay  now we're gonna dig into the to the serious stuff. Uh the selling price for the remote will be uh twenty five Euro  and the production cost uh may not be more than uh twenty and a half Euro. So uh from my point of view  I don't think it's uh gonna be very uh very high tech  high definition  uh ultra modern uh kinda remote  for twelve uh fift uh twelve and a half Euro. Uh the profit we must make with uh the new remote is uh fifty million Euro. So that's a lot. We have to sell uh a lot of uh Uh I think uh w when the selling price is twenty five  uh uh you got two million  two million remotes. But our marketing range is uh  market range is international. So we have uh virtually the whole world we can sell uh we can sell our r remotes to. At least that uh countries which have uh a television. Um So now it's time uh for us to uh going uh to discuss a little uh things. You can think about uh experience with a remote control uh yourself  at home. What you think might be uh a useful uh new feature. What uh what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others. Um so uh let's uh let's uh discuss a little. I'm gonna join you at the table. Well what what's the most uh important thing at a remote control? Okay. So not a not a remote control who uh uh which can uh can be used for television and a D_V_D_ and radio and Or just only If you have them on uh I can uh Okay. Oh  in case you want it This is a dead kind of fly. Between the the the  yeah  the the uh Yeah  be The screens. No no no. Only All the drawings go there  at the left uh Oh  that pen drawings. Uh no  I think uh when it is uh in Word and you have saved it in the Shared Documents folder  you can show it there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Five minutes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay. So it be uh a multi-purpose uh very technically uh high uh remote? Yeah  it must be really uh innovative  technical-wise? Yeah. So yeah  I I agree with you. So we must focus on things who are really uh really add something to uh to Yeah. No. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. But we have to keep an eye that it's Uh at the beginning of such a project  it's it's it's very uh cool to talk about  well  this would be cool  that would be cool. Uh but we must not uh lose uh sight of the the user uh uh friendly uh Yeah okay. Yeah. Okay. And that's because we have him. Okay  uh next meeting will start in thirty minutes. So uh you uh will have uh individual actions where I presume uh will be some feedback  uh via the m the mail. Um the the the Industrial uh Designer has to uh look at the working design. Uh the User Interface Designer has to look at the technical functions. So that's the thing we uh discussed. Yeah? Okay. Um wha Yeah. Yeah. But maybe  because uh you are working on the user requirements  you are working on the technical functions  we uh must uh have a little or kinda uh uh uh How do you call it? Uh Uh a little plan on on what we're going to do. So you don't uh uh come up with the user requirements who don't fit the the the the technical functions at all. Some basic things we co we want to going to do. Uh I think that's well uh Yeah. Will come in handy. Okay. W He says Yeah. Well  th that's that's really a step further. But if you say uh is it uh uh one way or multi-purpose  that's a Why? Why? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So uh each individually i individually uh must think on what's uh at uh his point of view is the most important. And uh then we're going to fit uh all the pieces together the next meeting. I must finish off now  so it's over. You uh will receive specific specific instructions uh by your personal coach. And I see you in uh thirty minutes. Thank you. Be careful. ,The project manager introduced himself to the team and then acquainted the team with the audio and video equipment in the meeting room. The project manager briefly described the company the team works for and discussed the corporate website. The project manager then described the upcoming project and the roles of each team member. The project manager introduced the smart boards to the team and led the team members in an exercise in which they each drew their favorite animal and described why they liked the animal. The project manager briefed the team on the project budget and selling prices for the remote they are to create and led them in a discussion on their experiences with remote controls and what features they would like to include in their product. 
Bongiorno. Punish. You wish. Welcome. Uh Yeah. No. Alright. But they like dark colours  you said in the p Okay. Well then I suggest that the corporate colours are grey and yellow. I had Or we could make oh. Yeah  o o I'm thinking about uh the Bananarama telephone uh telephone from uh Siemens. The yellow uh rubber telephone. It's the it's the rubber uh cover. And it's uh colourful. It looks likes a banana. We have the fruit  we have the colours. We have the simple design. Um thirty five. And the b the light blue and it's also in yellow. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well  I don't ha really have much to add  um because most of things we already said in uh the previous uh discussion. Um Uh the previous ideas were voice recognition and uh the round button for uh the p channel programming and uh volume. Well  a few interface I uh I found on the internet are are these. These are both with uh with voice recognition  but they're very advanced and very high-tech and just um  well  a weird um shape. So I suggest I couldn't uh I had a small uh mock-up uh sign on the on paper. But it didn't work. My pen didn't load um the information. So I made a really simple f uh a shape on uh in um PowerPoint. But we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control. Uh yellow. But if you have something like uh the Siemens phone  it's rubber. So it's easy in your hand Uh indeed. Yeah. Great. Oh and um to add on um Ruud's information  in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh  well  the the fancy colours and uh and so on  and still have the ease of use  because we have an easy interface. And all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and uh and so on. Yeah. So if you have the voice recognition  you can you can programme like thirty uh um thirty c uh controls on it. Yeah. Right. Great. Like the watch. But if you're watching a movie  how many times uh you take the the remote control and and if uh if you have a watch  you have the kinetic uh idea in a watch also. You you walk and uh but uh you you're sitting on a couch. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Oh  we can just make four push-buttons in a form of a round. But I th I don't think uh the scroll-wheels I had some I had some information about it too. I don't think there's any possibility for us to use scroll-wheels. I d I can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it. Yeah. Yeah  uh that's a possibility  but But Flores  think about a scenario where y where you would use the scroll-button for A volume  okay. Yeah. Wheel. Yeah  I believe uh if you have uh what we've earlier said  um the grip uh places in in the remote control. You have your hand on one place on the remote control  so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb. So in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect. Yeah yeah  you can um I have some information about it. Uh in the voice recognition you say a word you can programme words like uh v uh volume up. Of mute  let's say mute. Um you programme it  you m mute and you g you give um an uh an action to it that that's really the mute function and uh when you speak in the the remote control  it repeats uh your saying. So that's the sample sensor. So if you say mute  it says mute again  and then it's um well  I believe it's uh Yeah  and then uh he he repeats its action what which he believes it is. So you say mute  he repeats mute and you makes a computer sound mute  and then goes to the mute function. Yeah. Well  I don't have um I haven't looked for uh for information about it  but I don't think information uh y I don't think you need it on a display. Especially when when we have to look at a cost  I don't think uh 'cause uh uh all any T_V_ can uh can uh view a digit on uh on screen  yeah. But what about um the markets uh wants colourfuls uh designs? So if you use titanium Okay. Oh  sorry. Yeah. Yeah. And I would think And they can be implemented with a regular chip? Okay  but we also uh we already need the regular chip for the sample uh sensor speaker oh  evalu But most infrared uh remote controls don't have to be pointed at all. Well  if you if you take your hand before it  okay  it won't work  but you can point it just to the other wall. Yeah. And the regular chip. And and the scroll uh scroll-wheels. Yeah. No. Think so too. But we already have the scroll-wheels  the sp uh the speaker uh the speak recognition  the rubber  the fancy colours. Um no. Nothing more. Uh but uh can't scroll-wheels uh work with one uh one-curved case? Yeah  okay. Sorry  yeah. Oh  sorry. Yeah. Yeah. The project drawing is for the next Yeah  right. Single-curved. But can there be uh wor can they work together? Or do we have to choose between them? 'Cause if we have to choose yeah? Okay. What if not? Okay. Yeah. Grey and yellow. Yellow case and grey buttons  I think. I believe the But you have already um you must have a red uh on and off button. And um Well well Well  there is. Just a week ago  a keyboard manufacturer would print  with and uh No. A scroll-wheel. Voice recognition  of course. What what did you say? Yeah. Yeah  or you could use plastic buttons. In the rubber. Yeah  b But then you just have the the fact that um the drawings on the buttons will disappear eventually. What I said in the in the first uh discussion  uh the digit six on the button  it will disappear when it's from rubber. It is not uh something uh it's no information I read about it or so  but it's just from No  but but uh it Yeah  b yeah. Yeah  that's possible  but then you have still the images on the rubber of the case. So still then  if you feel uh li uh if you feel your remote control  you just rub on the cover  so you rub on the painting. Yeah. Yeah  but but the the plus or the minus. You have to draw the Yeah  it's on the cover. So if you uh You just move the problem. Y uh can you separate these uh these I do. Or the s uh the sideways. Or the the back. Or the back. I think Yes  especially when there are l a few buttons on it  you have uh a lot of space to touch. So you just have it in your hand completely or or i you play with it. Yeah. Yeah. Regular. Use with.. For the finishing touch. Uh yeah. But um Sebastian has everything. Hello hello Mister P_M_. Well  that's where the thinking goes on. I think you should punish him. You're the P_M_. Possibilities  yeah? Yes. So Not at all. Okay. Just press the okay button  it works. How surprising. Oh wait uh wait up. Uh so do you think um when fruit and vegetables are important for clothing and shoes that they are in remote controls also? Not something dull. Okay. But can you can you go back to that slide? The uh just one slide back  no no no. Yes. Okay  and the feel of the material has to be spongy. Has it something to do with that uh natural feeling also  do you think? Okay. It's quite interesting. Yes. I don't know the phone  but I can imagine it. Oh  that one  yes. Now I kn uh oh  I know  I know. Yes  I I've seen it. I've seen it. So So ease of use is important  but technology is twice as important. And what was even more important? Okay. So that's the most important thing for our customers. Mm-hmm. But it's it's kind of uh it's kind of o organic  so that's very good. Yes. Slippery. You have to grab it. Yes. There are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in  so you can get a really good grip on it. So you you don't have to um attain much pressure to it. It's it's a lot easier. So m Yes. But I'll I'll go into that deeper in my presentation. Okay  but I'll I'll go into that  because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities. Um I had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division  and uh we had a talk about all the different components um who are in this design. Uh these are the things we've looked at. And of course I used the web to uh find my information. About the casing  we have three different casing possibilities. We have the uncurved or flat case. Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh we're used to is just a it ju it's just a box. I'm sorry I I don't have any pictures of uh of this thing. We have uh a curved one. It's uh curved in two dimensions. You have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form. So it's uh a little more advanced in its in its shape. Uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape  which is curved in three dimension. I c I think you can compare it a little bit with the uh big grey image uh you had in your presentation. The the big remote control  something like that. But it's quite uh advanced and it's it's quite daring to to use I think. Um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing. We can use plastic  which is uh very slippery and maybe not so nice  but you can give it any colour  uh which is the same for rubber  but it's not slippery. We can use wood and titanium. Well  um we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases. And these latex cases  there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source source. Which brings me to the different energy sources. Um well  we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh remote controls. You really have to imagine like winding up your uh I d It would be very new  but it's a kind of a retro uh style  I think. Uh Well  this is quite interesting. Uh there's there's also a kinetic energy supply. So um when you're watching T_V_ uh or when you're you you have to um make some kind of energy kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall  whatever you wish. It have it it has to move  that's the the sense of it. And you can store the energy in the in the thing. Mm-hmm. It's very funny indeed. Mm-hmm. Indeed. Mm-hmm. Yes. But you know you know from your own watch your watch uses uh a minimal con it consumes a minimal amount of energy. the the shaking of your body  which is almost uh every activity makes your uh body shake  uh it charges it. But uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy. So I think uh you have a problem when you're watching a movie and uh you haven't moved the remote uh i remote control in a in an amount of time  and you want t to switch uh the channel or something  well  m it might not work. So that's something you have to keep in mind. So  but maybe maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries  so we can save on the batteries and um when there's enough kinet kinetic energy  use the kinetic energy  and otherwise use the batteries. Uh yes  it does. I'll come to that later. And we of course have the traditional uh solar power  which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity. The user interface controls  um of course we have the push-buttons and uh we also have scroll-wheels. And these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons. So it's just like a mouse. You can scroll 'em  you can also push it. Um uh in the indicators we have the L_C_D_ displays  which means uh you can watch uh in a display w which channel you have chosen or something like that of the li amount of volume which is uh currently uh and we also have double scroll-buttons  which are just two of these things. So we don't really have the the kind of button we had in mind in our uh uh in our last meeting  the the thing with the the round with the four Yes. That is possible too. Yes. Mm-hmm. Well  mayb uh well  m me neither. Maybe when you integrate some functions. Uh it's do it's done before. Yes. It's quite quite good  yes. Well  it's it well  i what he means is there's an button integrated in the scroll-wheel. There's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll-wheel. You just use the wheel. About mute. Well  yes. Okay. Yes. Well  okay. Well  that that that's one possibility  okay. Well  okay. It's quite goods. Mm-hmm. Yes. Hmm. But it's done before  uh there are many other devices um like uh telephones and our uh radio  pocket radios. We use this. And Well  it's it's been done years ago and I don't see it anywhere now. So maybe it's not no. Hmm. Yes  but it uses two separate buttons. It doesn't use a. Well. Uh something for uh Roo here. Wi within reach. Yes  you have to. Yes. yes. Yeah  yeah. Okay. Okay  um we have to know  if you want to use uh these rubber double-curved c uh case  um you must use these push uh push-buttons. There's no way you can integrate L_C_D_ displays. There's no way you can integrate scroll-wheels  because it's all curved. There's there are no uh flat areas where you can incorporate these things. So that's a limitation. About um the components  uh just the hardware. We basically have uh three types of chips we can use and uh these chips incorporate all the Logica and um um uh hardware that is needed to send uh to send a signal. Uh we have a simple  regular and advanced chip. And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker  which is a little cryptic uh to me. But I think that's the the voice recognition thing that we are uh thinking about. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So so okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay  so that's basically the the voice recognition item we were searching for. Okay. This sample sensor uh requires an regular chip  I thought. Um no op I'm not very sure. No  it's not in here. If we want to use the L_C_D_ display  we really need the advanced version  which is a bit l little bit more costly. If we want to use the scroll-wheels we need the regular version. And if we don't want to use uh any of these uh more advanced functions we can keep with the simple uh chip  which is a bit cheaper. Okay. Um no  but I think that's something for uh Roo here to think about. I I don't think either. No. I don't think you need it. Okay. Okay  well my conclusion  um unfortunately the market has decided the a little uh other than I thought. I thought um the market would like uh a sort m sort of titanium casing  but they seem to like natural uh stuff. So maybe we should think about uh wood finish. Um I've chosen the more battery with solar cell uh solution for the energy. It's more reliable  it's cheaper. So I don't think we should use the dynamo thing. The kinetic thing it it's it's a possibility. It's it's more advanced  but I'm I think you should combine it with batteries. Otherwise it will not too advanced  uh well. It's in in in some way it can give us an advance  because you will save on your batteries. But Yes. And I think it's more robust. It's more uh Uh it's more functional. The titanium thing uh we have to skip it. So I think we should skip the titanium uh stuff  and we should uh use wood or something like that. Oh okay  sorry. So it it needs to be rubber. Okay. Okay  spongy materials. Okay  um well um these scroll-wheels  I think uh they they can be they can be handy. So Yes  they can. But they really need the regular chip  you cannot use the sa simple Well  I'm not very sure. Maybe that's an uh a different I think so  if you if you stick with the the simple uh straight-forward uh not curve design  i uh it's too dull. I don't think c our customers will like it. And um if you uh take the double-curved  uh then you cannot um you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll-wheels. So I think this is the best of two worlds. Yes. It's it's uh I uh I can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device. It's very unlogical. Well the there has to be some pointing at. But All lights get absorbed  yeah. Yes  because the walls they they reflect the infrared light. So it has an it's easier. Um I suggest we use the the sensor sample. Uh the sample sensor and sample speaker. Um with a with a regular chip. I think uh it gives us the advantage of Yes  yes. And uh skip and skip the L_C_D_ part. I don't think it it's any uh value added thing. So Okay. Technology. Yes. It's not very flashy and new. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yes. Uh I think our customers will go insane. It's it's too much. Okay. Uh the n the next phase will be um the um not the what is the next phase f Flores? Okay. So i Okay. Okay. Okay  okay. Yes  they can work. They cannot work with double-curved. That's that's problem. I'll check it for you. Yes. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. So you will be on the Bahamas. Uh Okay. So can you uh give us a summary of all uh decisions we've made? I'll do. Okay. W start with the casing. Okay  single-curved case. Okay. What about the energy source? I I think they can. Yes. Well  uh It it should be. There should be really no problem. They can be supplementary. That's no problem. So So uh uh just uh the energy source is um the batteries and the solar. Okay. What about uh the finishing of the case? We have decided we wanted to use the rubber? Okay  and I think we should use the company colours. Something like black and red. uh black and yellow. Grey yellow  okay. Oh  I think it's uh it's not very dull. It's quite modern actually. Don't you think? Hmm. Okay. Okay  but uh I'm afraid it's not possible to print a picture on uh the device. Because uh I agree it would be nice to have have something like that on the device itself. But Oh  I've read. Yes. Yes  but our manufacturing department is not so advanced in its uh techniques. They're actually very slow in its techniques. So So I'm afraid it's not possible. Okay  so scroll-wheel. But there will be some additional buttons  I guess. And th the they should be spongy also  because they're they're rubber too. Well uh you can use well  when you use the buttons  they'll they'll be made of rubber too. So it has th the spongy uh feel also. So I I think that's okay. Yes. That's okay. Yes  the signs. Uh I see what you mean. Well  maybe that's possible  because um uh our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing. So maybe they can combine these two. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well  I'm I'm not so sure  I think it c should be Well  I'm not sure  I have to ask with manufacturing  but I'm I'm not sure that's what you want  because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel  and that's what you get with rubber. So if you want the spongy feel  you need uh to make these buttons all all of rubber. I think both. I do. I think Okay. Um not quite. Um what about uh the chips? We use the regular chip? Okay. And Well no  I think that's about it. Yes. The only difference between the advanced and the regular version is that the advanced uh version of the chip supports L_C_D_. That's all. And we've decided not to use L_C_D_. So Okay. Okay. I'll put it online. Um Mm  don't think so. Unless uh things have suddenly change again. Uh don't know. Maybe uh you've got new information  like uh last time. Okay. Oop. No. 'Kay. Hmm? Oh.. Yeah  Okay. Yeah. Yeah. My method? Well  findings. Uh Ease of use is important  but uh innovation is more important  and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important. And uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their uh clothes  shoes and furniture  and that they want spongy material. Probably watch too much Sponge Bob. Uh the older group uh still prefers dark colours. Simple shapes uh m material. But we since we are concentrating on uh the younger group 'Kay. Well  uh one example given was this  so um I assume they just want something colourful. Not uh specifically uh an apple as a remote control or something. No  uh the younger group likes uh more colourful uh objects. But Which one? This? Yes. Uh well  it might. But personally I wouldn't like a sponge as a remote control. But Maybe soft material or something. But not a real sponge. Yeah  exactly. Yeah  and like uh the older group likes familiar materials  but that doesn't mean we should use wood  So Well  this this is an example of what they would like. But since we're conten concentrating on uh the younger group  I think we should use soft materials and uh make it colourful or uh like cell phones  exch exchangeable covers. So we could provide both for the young and the old what they like. I've seen it  but 'Kay. Uh that's about it. Yes. Uh soft material. Uh the fancy look and feel. Yes. Apparently. Yeah. Um Uh well  it's obvious obviously new. So it might attract uh the young customers. Hmm. And yeah  the yeah  the older people liked wood. No the Yeah  the younger people liked soft material. Yeah. Yeah. Standard? Nah  um n no  I don't think so. M Hmm. Or black and yellow. Yeah. Uh didn't did we inc uh include the digi digits or uh leave them to the speech recognition? 'Cause things like uh volume could be uh placed next to the button. There the icons. So you don't touch the icons that much. Do you need to change anything on it? Because otherwise I will already open it. Okay. Is it much changes? Uh I didn't No no. I do hot have Only the same information. Hello  Sebastian. I believe uh Miss uh Tentel is with us as well  in the control room. Oh  it's that Roo again  always late. Bongiorno. Hmm. I see some interesting okay. People  welcome back. The third meeting. Um I have some points I would like to uh some some issues I would like to point out. Um first of all  um if you make minutes yourself as well  uh like Sebastian does  um could you put them on the shared folder? If you do not make minutes  no problem  but it's easy for me to see what you uh wrote down  so I could uh can uh um use that in the in the report. Um the second thing  um I was th uh s thinking to myself  I have this little remote control  and I'm talking to it  but I still need to point to the television  because it works with infrared. That's quite strange. Okay. We'll come to that later  I g I think. Um the agenda for now uh uh are there any pre-discussion questions? Okay. Um we wi we will have your individual presentations  uh then the decision on the remote control concept  um and uh the closing. Forty minutes in total for this. So um I think we we can immedis immediately start with the individual presentations  um the progress you've made. Um I think it might be smart to look at uh Ruud's um information first  because I understood there are some uh significant changes in the market situation. Um yeah. Uh w wait a sec wait a se uh could you go to the previous slide? Um because I'm taking minutes and it Um were the important themes enclose. Yeah okay. The feel of to be spongy Okay  so so  yeah  it might not be t uh it it shouldn't be too hard. It it maybe it rubber or or yeah. Okay. Yeah. Well  that's interesting. You could make a few v very colourful ones  and uh a very traditional co cover. Yeah  yeah. Yeah  it is  it is i yeah. Yeah. Do you know the phone? It's the Siemens uh C_ twenty five  I believe it's it's the one the Post-bank uh gave away  the very You kn you know  Ruud  as well? About th Okay. Okay. Um uh okay. Do you have uh thit that was Okay. Okay  so the the m uh important findings are uh innovation is more important than ease of use for the our target group. And um colouring is important and and uh soft materials. Okay. Okay  Roo  could you do your presentation? Okay  well it's good to to sum up uh the things we already thought about. Shape. Yeah. And what I'm thinking about  maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip um I mean this is how you hold a remote control. Um it shouldn't be too uh glatt  too slippery  s because um Yeah. Yeah  exactly. Yeah. Yeah  ex for your fingers  yeah. Yeah. It grips automatically. Yeah  okay. Okay  good. Yeah. Way too much I think for our goal  yeah. Okay  b but I think we'll yeah. Okay. Well  it would be very new to the market  but Yeah. I think um  if if I can hook on to that  um the kinetic thing is very funny. I mean solar is of course it's nice  but it's  well  your uh your calculator has a solar panel. Um hand dynamo Well  maybe m Yeah  I know. Yeah. Yeah. And wha Okay. Yeah. Okay  because I guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f uh a lot of power. Yeah. Okay. Well This will be the remote  right? Um with uh maybe a channel selector. What about integrating a scroll-bar on this side? Because this is how you keep it Volume? Well  what about mute? Thi i i m I guess uh th this is my volume button. And I can either on this side or this side um And click it to muten the device. And and it makes it different from the traditional uh devices on this market. So I'm looking for a way to uh make it a little different than the traditional ones. So maybe um I guess that that's something you two uh need to think about. Uh Ruud  wha what do you thing about uh a scroll-bar? Uh scroll-wheel. Okay. Yeah. Well  all the Sony telephones use it  for example  for volume. Nokia has a well  okay  it's not really a scroll-wheel  but on their side th the the volume button is on the side  because you gri grab it like this. Yeah. I know  it's not really a scroll-wheel. No. Yeah. For you too  yeah. Okay. Sebastian. Um Yeah. It performs the action. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Uh well uh d did we already decide on the display? To No. On screen display. Yeah. Okay th Okay. Good. Kineti okay. Okay  it's maybe a bit too too flashy  too yeah. Yeah  but that that's the same with the solar cell. That's no different. Yeah. Okay. No no  but the uh um that's what Sebastian said. He said uh this is what uh this is my personal preference. But but yet  I understood that the market is different. So um No  r rubber with colours. Colourful and Yeah. But but do we want the curved uh uh design  or I it's too dull. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay  what about um the issue I um addressed at the beginning of the meeting? Um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue. Because it it's of cour Yeah. Well It depends also on your on your Well  it depends on your walls actually. If you have uh have um smooth walls  it it it probably you're probably right. But if you have carpets on the wall  which our natural loving friends probably do have  then um yeah  th th it might be a bit more of a issue. So Yeah. I like the scroll wheels uh idea. Yeah. Well  it looks uh yeah  well um according to Ruud  the the the market likes um new flashy technology  and I mean L_C_D_ is well  ok I know  but it's m it's less um s standard than than Well  we are not very w we do not know uh much about the the f the financial part. That's the problem. Because if we do have enough um space in in our finance  I would say do integrate it  because it it adds a little ext extra high-tech feeling to it. Mm yeah. Okay  okay. Yeah. Okay  I I agree. I think i Ruud  do you have any um anything you would like to um add or or maybe thoughts or No? Sebast uh nee  Roo? Roo  do you have any other Nothing more. Um Sebas Well  we we need to describe uh decisions now. So um on the energy  well  we decided. Chip. The case uh rubber with uh c one one uh one curve. User interface um Um then the corporate identity should be uh in the product. I guess that is something for Roo and Sebastian. Uh you talked about it before  the colours  grey and yellow. Keep it in mind. And um the buttons  well we talked about it now. The next phase  um Sebastian  um is um the design of the look and feel. The user interface design. And for you  the product evaluation. Um I'm sure your personal coach will give you more information on that. Um and uh the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ need to work together on the prototype drawing on the SMARTboard. And I'm going uh to plan my holidays. Yeah  it's it's uh when we come back in thirty minutes  uh you will have a uh prototype ready. Yeah? I can. Um maybe one of you could write it down. Great. Um Uh you you need to help me. Um The casing is curved  single-curved. Traditional batteries uh and solar. No  they can be complementary. Uh al al I uh Every device Yeah. Okay  um th Battery and solar  yeah. Yeah  with colourful rubber. Uh if it's possible with uh different um covers  but I'm not sure if our suppliers can uh can help us with uh with such uh uh a wish. Uh grey and yellow or black and yellow. Yeah. Yeah  although I don't think that's very colourful. Except for the yellow of course  but um I could think of a more uh attractive uh c uh set of colours. Well  I was more thinking about the fruit colours that the Ruud showed us before. Well  it it doesn't have to be red. Uh I mean th uh I think these colours are really what our young people are looking for. Um so maybe it shouldn't even be two colours  it should be a full colour cover with such an image or or I mean thinking in two colours is is too black and white for our m uh c uh market group  I guess. Black and yellow  yeah. Okay  so we have to deal with wh what's possible here. Yeah. Okay. Um more f more more decisions we made. Um Um The scroll-heel. Yes  the voice recognition we already decided. Yeah. Uh I'm going to leave that up to you two. Yeah. I think rubber is nice. Because it uh i I mean what do you touch the button  and what do they want spongy uh uh devices  or or i. Uh is that uh does our our supplier say so? Yeah. You could place a um uh this this would be the button. The scroll-wheel  I mean. And you could place the indica th th the signals the No no  there's no painting  only uh yellow or But it's into the rubber. Yeah  but this is on the pla yeah  I know. Um I think uh I know which you understand af uh I know what you mean. What about um making this rubber and making this plastic? Yeah. Well actually  we should have it the other way around  I guess. A plastic cover with rubber finishing. I mean  this is this is the finishing. This is um what's on the edge. What you feel. But the front  on which the the buttons are doesn't have to be rubber. I mean I know  but do you touch this or do you touch this? I mean  I I never touch between the buttons. Yeah  the side  exactly  the sideways. The side  but do you touch between the the these buttons? Okay. Well  we do not have very much time uh left. Um I guess you two have to figure that out. I'm going to leave the decision to you  um because you have to make its prototype  and um yeah y you have the most knowledge about the suppliers  the possibilities and uh so I'm going to leave it the decision with you. Um Sebastian  did you write enough decisions down? Yeah. Okay. With those regular chips we can still uh control advanced functions. The chip is is not really Okay  well. Yeah. Okay. Um okay  then I think we are uh quite finished. Um I'll see you guys in thirty minutes and um Yeah? Yeah  um if you write wrote anything down  uh could you put it on the shared folder? Yeah. I know  but well Great. Right. ,The industrial designer talked about the options available for materials and components. He suggested that the case should be double-curved  and be made from plastic and rubber rather than wood or titanium. He also recommended using basic batteries rather than solar or kinetic power. He also mentioned the possibility of using an LCD screen to add something special. The user interface designer went over the functions to be included in the remote. The group discussed using large buttons for the most frequently used functions. The marketing expert gave a presentation on trend watching. A fancy look and feel is most important to users  followed by technological innovation and ease of use. The younger market also likes the theme of fruit and vegetables and spongy material  which could be implemented through fruity colours and using a spongy material for the base. The group discussed how to incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme  as well as the company colours and logo. The group discussed whether to include an LCD screen  and eventually decided against it. The project manager closed the meeting and told the group they would receive emails about their tasks for the next meeting. 
Good afternoon. So Hello. No problem. Okay. That's possible on uh this time of day. Starts at three o'clock. Uh Uh  let me see. Our fourth and last meeting. There he is. Yes. Okay this our last meeting. In this meeting we will discuss our final design. And we will do some evaluation about the  not only the product  but also the project. And then we're going to close the project today as well. So after this you will be uh free to go and uh spend all your money. And this uh design  detailed design meeting uh we will discuss uh the look-and-feel of the design  the usability interface design  and we will do the product evaluation. Um  in order to do that we have this agenda. We'll have the prototype presentation first. Then we will set up some evaluation cri um criteria. Then we will look at the finance. Uh we will have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget. Because everything costs money  and the more functions you wanna have the more money it will cost. So we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half Euro per remote. But we will see that later. Then we will do the project uh evaluation  and the closing after that. We've got forty minutes. So we will be finished at half past three. But first um we will do the this is prototype presentation. So  if some yeah if somebody wants step forward. Okay. Okay. Uh but um I thought in a few meetings earlier we uh uh tried to keep it uh simple. Uh just a few buttons and large buttons. But uh I think these are altogether quite a quite a few buttons. So I'm wondering if we if we neely really need all of those buttons. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Long time. Yeah. If you put Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Uh teletext and subtitles are yeah necessary. Okay. Yep. Okay. So we had somebody about th interfa Something about the design of the buttons there? Just n normal plain buttons. Yeah. 'Kay. No. No. Yeah. Okay. Yep. Okay. That's nice. Then because we only have thirty minutes left  I will move on to the finance part  which is pretty exciting  to see if it's all possible what we wanna do. And I can tell you that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half Euros. If we see I don't know if I've filled in correctly  so just correct me if you see uh something wrong. I counted two batteries. But maybe we can also use one. I don't know if it's possible. It's rechargeable. That's right. Okay. That's two Euros off. We need the advanced chip. So there's not much to uh to save there. Here we have the single curves. Uh we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one Euro. Um  I don't know  but I think the single curved is good for design  and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control. I think we have to keep that. Then we have the case material supplements. It's plastic. It's the cheapest one we need. So that's uh not much to save either. But then the biggest costs are the buttons. So maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to uh keep our costs low. Because you have to we will have to get the twelve and a half Euros at the end. Um  so if we Let's fir first count the buttons we have now. Because I Sixteen. Nah  that will be even more then. Eighteen Euros. So  seventeen. Okay  including the help? Yeah. Uh seventeen. I think we can uh discard the help and the mute button uh by pressing down volume long  or pressing down a a number long. That saves us uh one Euro already. 'Cause then we have got fifteen I think? Fifteen buttons. And this is No those are one  I think. Yeah but th it's not stated in this files. So maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one  by pressing That's possibility as well. So And it's good for the design as well. So you can make Uh let's see. If you make this Looks a bit like uh a cross. Plus. Min. Uh s yeah channel. Yeah w Yeah th I think they count uh the materials. Yeah on the chip there. Yeah. That's right. That's right. But I think because we have the advanced chip we can just count this as one button. But No but I think Yeah. Maybe it is  but then it seems to me that it's impossible to get the twelve and a half Euros. Also the L_C_ display  I think it's  I think it's too expensive for the display we use. I think they uh try t That's right  but what's the big advantage of our remote then? Yeah. No. That's extra. That's extra. That's right. That's an option. Poland. Something. Polish supplier. Don't you think we can  if we can count this as v as one button  and integrate th uh these buttons in three  then we save a lot of money as well. Yeah. That's a point. Yep. No. Yeah but uh we have to stick to the twelve and a half Euros. We don't have any more budget to develop it. Yeah. So It is. If you leave out the L_C_ display. And if you use less buttons. Say Or you can take the single chip. There it is. But then w Good looking. Yeah. I think it's uh difficult as well  but Or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers. Then w Because then we save ten buttons. Then we have five and one. And and see. If we have this one and we've got the advanced W uh  we're getting close. Then you will Or maybe you can um scroll. If you scroll you will see the numbers on the L_C_D_ display. Until you've got the right number  then you push it. Alright. It's gotta scroll and push. Okay but then you you can push uh some other button as well. Yeah. That's right. So if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second  then it g turns to that channel. But it would definitely crop cost  a lot. And we need the battery. And the regular chip is not possible? It has to be advanced? It has to be advanced. Yeah. Okay. And we can save a Euro by a flat design. That's an option we can Then we're almost there. Yeah. So if we Yeah but I think that's That is a big advantage  if we're But Can we use can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button? If you push it three times? Yeah. Ah that's not really that No. I think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide  you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel. If you just make it real simple. Because it saves it saves a lot of money. And we can keep our L_C_D_ screen  which can provide extra information. How to use the scroll wheel. How to use the other bu buttons as subtitles. And it's good for the innovative design as well. If you would erase these. Mm eraser? And we put uh Looks a bit odd maybe. That is Something like that. Then  yeah. We've got the scroll-wheel. One  two  three  four  five buttons  if we erase this one. And these are two buttons then. Yeah. Yeah. That's really a good good idea  I think. And it will make the use of the scroll wheel uh more obvious indeed. So we make one for the volume  one for the channel. Plus scroll. That's right. So we've got one  two  three. Yeah  we can leave the teletext in if we want. That's m that's better. Y yeah. Mm yeah. Uh yeah  and then you can That's right. So we can decrease this one to four buttons. Yeah. That's no problem. Yeah. Yeah. It's uh it's more the moulds in which they are being made  I think. Single curved is really easy to just fill in. And cases come right out of the machine. And single curved you have to have a different uh different machine  than a flat one. I think this is a really easy one. Um  what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design? Freek  what do you think? Yeah. Yep. We have to cut costs. Yeah. Yeah I'm ag Ask for more money. Yeah. Yeah. I am agreeing with the usability. Yeah. Yeah. But th um I think we can then keep the single curved one. Just to express our L_C_D_ screen a bit more. So people will use it more  and especially for the help functions  it will be good if we have scroll bar  scroll button. It will be necessary to have good help function  as well. So this is scroll. I think it was better to have this price list a bit earlier. Before we went on to the to the whole design. But I'm glad we could make a bit. It's pretty different  if you saw the last one than this one. Yeah. It will. Yeah. No  but I think I think the most That's right. We can let l We can stick it out  a bit. Like a old old buttons. Maybe that's recognisable for them as well. Yeah. That's a good one. So  I'm afraid we have to move on. And it's uh it's b uh less frightening  I think. If they see this design they think oh  there are only five buttons  and uh But we will see. Yeah. That's definitely right. Yeah. I would buy it. That's right. I would buy it if I was six. No I don't know. What it costs under twelve and a half Euros? No? Uh  yes they are. No. But we can go on with the project evaluation. Let's see. I can sit down I think. We still have fifteen minutes left  so we're nice on schedule. Um  the project process. Evaluation criteria. That's right. That was the the point I forgot. I should There we are. Evaluation criteria. Go ahead. We've got five minutes I think for those criteria. No we've got fifteen minutes but Uh yes. What? Uh yeah. Okay. Yeah  that's because my pen failed to upload his data. I tried to but it's uh it's giving errors by downloading the software. I think it's fancy. Yeah. Six. Very. Subtitles  buttons. Yeah. Seven. Yeah. So we've got twenty cents for our docking station  huh? Yeah. That's right. That's a bit dodgy. I would say four. Four or five between. Between four or five. Yeah. Is it functional? Yes. No. Think it's uh seven. It was. I had them worked out. Mm. They are ugly  not very functional  and getting lost. Yeah. No I think with our new radio button  I think it's uh I think it's better. I think it Yeah. I would give it a four. Then we have to do the three. It's the Yes it is. Yeah. And they wanna put fashion in their products. Uh in the slogan of the company. And we have the removable front cases. So  I think it's very recognisable. Yep. We've got a calculate it. Mm? N We've gonna We're going to evaluate it. Forty nine. Forty one. That's Around eighty percent. What is it? That's eighty four percent. I think that's a pretty nice score. Okay. Thank you. So  that brings us to the project evaluation. Yep. Thank you. Project process. Did we move through the right phases  you think? Along the process? That's right. So lack of information about prices. Okay. Uh Okay. Satisfaction. Was there room for creativity? No? It's because of the finance sheet. Yeah. The room was Yeah. Restrictions. Internet access. 'Kay. Leadership. Was it clear what everybody had to do uh according to their roles and functions? Yeah? Teamwork? Did it work out? Working together? Also  you two of you with the uh last phase? Nice. tasks. Okay. Were the means sufficient for the tasks uh we had to do? Or were they too much? Smart-board. If it wants to download its uh data. Failed download. Smart-board was irritating. So you rather wanted to have a flip-over? Or something else? Faster as well  I think. Yeah. Flip-over. Yeah. Uh you need a smart board uh application I think. But I think you can Yeah. Should be possible. Yeah you can export it as image. Must Yeah must be So the sharing of the information was uh was okay? Uh  network. Yeah  pen is here on the table. Yeah. It's possible. Okay. That's nice. Have we found new ideas for having this kind of meetings? Or Yeah. Yeah. So Yeah. So everybody puts his own score. And then it mediates the score  and you can get one Yeah. That's better. So that's uh How do we call? Evaluation criteria. Okay. Mm  any more ideas? Or questions about the project? Or about the product? Because I think then that we get to our last sheet. Are the costs within the budget? Yeah. Do we Docking station. That's a good point. But maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher? Uh and I think you can compensate that as well. So I think that shouldn't be the biggest problem  because it's very cheap to make as well. Do we think we gonna get the twelve and a half million? Or what was it? Fifteen fifteen million. I think we will. If we gonna export this product. It's innovative. Especially in America. People are pretty decadent. Sometimes. You can do more. Yeah. Just put it on the market for everybody. You can you can change markets where by changing the front covers. That's one thing you can change it with. So you can also try to uh reach the younger people by uh putting fancy covers on on the market. Just as a test. See how it works. That's I think a good advantage. Yeah. Uh  uh then I think we can have our little celebration  right now. That's it. Yeah. I think we still have to fit in one more questionnaire. I think. I don't know. I didn't get a message from the from ending of the Oh I think I have one now. Five more minutes? Oh that's nice. Then we still have some questions. If somebody has some questions they can ask them now. Or we can put these in the project folder as well. Maybe that's Export as picture  I think. Hmm. This is another network  I guess. Does somebody see the project folder? I don't. Hmm. My Documents. Yeah  I'll just put it in My Documents and uh That's okay. Okay. I think I'm going to make our final presentation now. And then I will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation. Summary of the project. Yeah. Questionnaire. I think you all get a questionnaire in in your room. And then I'll meet you in I think about ten minutes  or something. Okay. Thank you. Hopefully my pen will download its software. Oh. Or data. So Yeah. Yeah. Uh  that's just uh the normal uh as th as the normal uh remote controls uh So um You put it uh you um came in uh page uh one hundred. Now you can use the normal uh one to zero buttons. And you But you can also uh use the um button th for uh changing the the channel. S so uh the shifting uh button. Uh for uh yeah shif shifting up in uh on t on t uh teletext  and shifting uh down. So Oh yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah. Uh  or you can build in uh when you press uh one button uh uh Yeah. But m Yeah. We disc discuss that already. But uh we think uh old people uh don't know that uh option. So uh they just put in uh put press uh the button and uh And uh Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  it Yeah yeah. Just to recognise it  so uh Uh yeah and now we don't need uh LEDs or um Y uh s some uh remote controls uh do it also  but um uh because we use the little display we don't uh have to use it. Uh so Nay. Mm. Yeah we can u just uh 'Kay. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Uh Sixteen  I believe so. Uh seventeen. Uh with the help button. Yeah.. Yeah. Where did uh Uh  it's just one button. But  um Yeah. There were uh two uh for one big button. But they are uh more expensive than the small ones. Uh  yeah. So It's just a. But I don't don't know if if it's cheaper. So uh  we've still got four buttons  but just um So You got uh not not a butt button itself  but uh on the um Yeah. On the chip you've got still uh four uh four buttons. So Yeah  but. Are we gonna buy a um a remote control uh when you can uh use it? So um Yeah. We m uh we must um stay below the um below um twelve uh fifty or Can't uh go um Nay. Is it impossible to But it is possible to make one uh for uh twelve fifty. I don't think so. S Yeah. But  you can't use uh Yeah. But we want to make a uh so uh uh fancy and a good uh Yeah. Uh  wi with n Oh  with uh attractive uh o options. So uh  you can stay uh below uh twelve fifty. So Scroll-wheel's one. No  it Yeah. Yeah. Mm. D yeah. Hmm. Ja ja. Yeah  or we have to uh skip the subtitle uh button. So Yeah Yeah it's a big advantage. But um  it's Uh  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But if you push the teletext button twice It's uh One m uh one b uh  a few buttons. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Uh yeah. But uh  you can make a f quite a big uh remote remote control for uh just the same price as a small one. Just uh you only have to pay for the double curved or single curved. It uh it's a bit uh.. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The th No. But um But they know the scroll-buttons from uh old radios. Uh they cal also uh buttons like that for uh changing uh channels. So maybe it's uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. But very special  so uh No. Mm. Yeah? Mm. 'Kay. Uh six. Yeah. Mm. Sh Yeah. Mm. Not really. For old people I I W Yeah. Four. Yeah. N Yeah. No. Mm m Yeah. Mm  th yeah. Yeah. Uh We have to test it s But Uh  yeah  true. I go for three. So Yeah yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. But it Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.. Mm. Yeah. So Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. But Uh Yeah. A flipper's uh easier  so Yeah. But if you want to share uh of uh when you make um a picture like this uh on the presentation  it's easier to uh share it with uh other people. Uh so uh you can sh save it uh and uh put it on the internet  or uh uh in shared f uh folder or uh sh uh shared directory. So So Yeah? No? T can uh can you export it uh like a Yeah.. Uh. Uh  yeah. So you can Uh It's possible. Okay. Um  yeah maybe um uh when we n uh just uh give the numbers of of uh Uh uh o one of uh out of s uh sev Um it's uh easier to uh to do the th things that are like that on a computer. Uh  so uh just l uh like uh at u university uh So Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Mm yeah.. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Hmm. Where's the champagne? Uh  I believe y uh Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Uh maybe uh they will save it. So uh Okay. Uh maybe we have to fill uh another questionnaire. So uh Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Well this is what me and Richard came up with. The default spot for the on-off button. The mute button just below that. Then there's the volume and channel selectors. Simple plus-minus button. Uh we thought of a help button. If you hold it and you press another button  uh the help goes to the L_C_D_ screen. Then there's the zero to one to zero buttons. A button for teletext. A button for the subtitles. And the company logo. So it's rather simple prototype. And uh we'll have to see from testing uh how the users take it. Sure uh just pop in at any time. I think if you look at most controls  they've got more buttons than this. And well the on-off button  it's it's a necessity. You can't drop that one. The volume and channel buttons  you need you obviously need those those. The mute button could be replaced uh by pressing the volume-down button twice. So we could cancel that one. I think the help button really is necessary because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does. Well  you can't leave out the number buttons I guess. And Yeah. So it's rather basic already. Yeah  they're It's rather hard to draw on the white-board. But they're supposed to be equal sized  round  with a with a little logo on it for the for the volume  the the triangle and stuff. Just for recognition. So and for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons. With a a different colour than the case. So they jump out. And uh that's about it. Yep. Yes. Yep. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Uh that's that's a big cost. If we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip. Which isn't the the docking station isn't even in this c s schematic. So it's not even taken into the price. We we could save money on it. But would it make the remote more usable for elderly people? My mother can't even send send an S_M_S_ message. So Yeah. The margin will get too small. Yeah. Ten. No remote. That's We're getting closer. Yeah. You could just not scroll for a half a second. So you won't need a button. If you want to use an L_C_D_ screen you you need an advanced chip  yes. Yep. Yeah if you v could just leave out one more button. Yeah. I think so. Yeah. What if you have to scroll to page eighty eight? Eight hundred eighty eight. Yeah. Okay. No. We could make two buttons out of that. And just um If you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll-wheel. So that would save two buttons. If you do the same for the channel. More obvious. So if we Yeah. So If we leave out all those buttons  perhaps you can go with the flat flat case. And make it smaller overall. So if you put the the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on-off button  the screen right behi under that  than the scroll button you get a a much smaller remote. And it sh Yeah? Yeah. Richard's argument was very good. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Six. Yeah. Four or five. Yes. No. Mm  we haven't thought of that one. I think that's a three. I still I think it's too m too fancy. Too too flashy. Twendag sieven an twendag. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. That's true. Yeah  there w there was enough room  but the finance uh Yes. Yes  was okay. The tasks are very structured  so you can just do step by step and it's very easy. Well  the smart-board  the d d drawing is just a pain in the ass  but The digital the digital pen is very nice. Yes. Yeah. A flip-over or a more precise uh digit Yes. No. Didn't work. Yes. Yeah. Considering we are not going to make a docking station. Perhaps. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Good afternoon. Sorry I'm a little late. Got stuck in the traffic. Yeah. Um  is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality? Um  when you're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Um Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Think so. That's what I pointed out earlier. If you just make a control for just the T_V_ there's just not much to gain here. Since it rechargeable. Um Damn. Wouldn't Yeah. No. That wouldn't be an option. Uh  d I assume you'd count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each  right? Well  think actually there're two buttons  aren't they? Well I was thinking  maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button. That would cut the cost. Mm-hmm. Yeah. But  I think this really is four buttons anyhow. Yes. Only the docking station  I guess. Maybe we should to a different supplier. Yeah. Yeah  that's what I'm wondering. Um Well  since the market research indicated that older people spend their money easier  more easy  maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little. Especially since we have those nice features. It would be a be a pretty rigid one. Or b Basically becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost  or just any other remote control. But how does scroll-wheel work here? That would bring up the price of the scroll-wheel also. Integrated scroll-wheel push-button. But Yeah. I think that would be like the end of our usability. Yeah  but Well  think it's pretty much the teletext subtitles are right now you just push the teletext button  go to page eight eight eight  and teletext disappears. But the subtitles stay there. I think that's the case on most Well  that could be just uh like the scroll to eight  click  scroll to eight  click  scroll to eight  click. But then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people  who don't even know what a scroll-wheel is. Holding a remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero. With only five buttons on it. And a scroll-wheel. True. True. That's a pretty big scroll wheel. So this is five buttons. Right now we have five. Mm. Well  I still think we should go for the single curve design. But then again  all these changes are not really okay with me. But since we just have to. I'd rather just go to the board and get us to spend eighteen dollars a a remote. Or do some market research and see what the options are. Yeah. Yes. Definitely. Yeah. It's pretty different. But this is not really like for the group we were making our remote. This will really require a lot of marketing to get this to sell. 'Cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff. This is not familiar for them. So we're gonna have to do a lotta convincing them. Yeah. That's true. Might uh might be confusing too. They'd be like  what? Only five buttons? Yeah. But you're not sixty. Mm-hmm. So um  I like set up all these criteria. And evaluation of the thingy. Thank you. Five more minutes? Okay. 'Kay so I did some literature study study  and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier. Translated it into criteria  which would be these. Um  is the remote fancy? The shape  look and feel. Innovative? What new functions are there? Uh  easy to use? Uh  learnability is a very important factor here. Uh  is it functional? Are there not too many functions uh among the functions? And are the those functions that are there  are they useful? And the cost. The target group. Is the remote really for the group we're making it for? And recognability. If our company is If it is easily recognisable that our company made it? And So we're supposed to evaluate it right now. Let's see. Oh I have to say this was a little hard  because the minutes of our last meeting were not here. Okay. Interesting. So Is the design fancy  on a scale of one to seven? We all go for six? Good. Um  is the design innovative? I think so  with our L_C_D_ screen  docking station  scroll-buttons. Seven? Should be do-able. Is the design easy to use? Well Would be for us. But I'd go for four  too. Is the design functional? Um  do we have all functions that we want to include? I think we do. Do we have too many functions? I don't think so. It's pretty slim. Seven. Oh  and do we um take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control? Like it getting lost and R_S_I_ influences? Think we do. Are the production costs within the preset limits? Well they are now. Does the design fit the group of focus? Yeah. I think it doesn't. I don't know. I think I think a radio button is not exactly what older people expect to have a remote control. I'm not sure. I think I'd go for two. 'Kay. Is the company company recognisable? Well  we have the logo there. So Yeah. So that will be this. I was also supposed to calculate the score  but thought we would have another private thingy after this. Is this Like after this  are we done? Or We're gonna go to our other room again. Well  anyhow. These are seven factors times seven is forty something. Two? No. Nine? Uh  minus one. Minus three  minus four. Minus four. So that would be minus eight. Forty one out of forty nine. Okay. Guess I'll just type that in on the bottom here. Hmm. 'Kay. So that will be the evaluation. Think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier. In the design phase. Yeah. Definitely. No. Not too much. No. Yeah  true. But And I would've liked to go for the younger users also. And just to be able to access internet and get something of your own. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  I tried to open the file on my laptop  but not possible. Yeah. no. Should've done that then. Pen is here. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. They are. Yeah. Fifty grand. Yeah. Yeah  still I think I mean if we're n gonna make a scroll-button anyway it'd be more for the younger people than for the older people. So maybe we should just re-focus. Or specifically for younger people. That's true. Yeah  I think then it would be way more uh popular with younger people than it is  than would be with older people. Even if it were their covers. But Party party. 'Kay. Oh you did. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah  it probably will. Oh yeah  you're supposed to make a final Are we supposed to go into our own rooms again? Yeah. Yeah. That'd be nice. ,After introducing the remote control objective  the project manager demonstrated the SmartBoard technology they would be using. They tested it by drawing animals. The project manager informed the group of the budget  before beginning the discussion of current remotes and initial ideas. They considered taking the best of their competitors designs and making a multifunction remote. It needs to be useable internationally  with few buttons. The considered options for the shape of the remote control  imagining how it would fit in the hand. The group ended the discussion by touching very briefly on some materials issues  and discussed remote covers. 
Okay. So. Matthew is uh late again. Probably an important man. Um. So well it is important for him to be here uh. He he he You did work together didn't you? Yes. Yes. Yes. Mm. Um yes but w we Yes  maybe we should phone him. Um well Um  when he is not here we will just we just have to continue. Um so just for record I I will take uh notes again. And um well first thing uh I was uh uh I got an email from uh from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget of the uh twelve Euro and fifty cents. It's uh well he said to me well uh when you stay in it's good  when you don't stay in you have to redesign. There is no uh no negotiation uh possible in this matter. So we have to consider that. Good. Um so maybe Anna  you can have your presentation. Okay Matthew. Nice uh you are here. Great. Great. Oh ma maybe then you can start now with mm presenting your uh your designs. Mm. Eye. Uh-huh. Yes. Ah  okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Exce except for the for the special shape  the surfing board  it has a quite a a conventional layout of buttons uh. Mm-hmm. Yeah no you can carry on  I just look how it feels all. Yes it really feels like like like a mobile phone. Just I'm I really want to talk to it. But. So but but continue with your uh mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. From D_V_D_ player to television or something. Yes. Mm. Yes and and and then you get feedback via the L_C_D_ yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah but but but but uh i in there uh when this is closed  will it also uh cover up the L_C_D_ screen? But but the L_C_D_ screen I mean is a very uh well an eye-attracting feature which shouldn't be shouldn't be That th that's true. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yes. Yes  more robust. Yes okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. But w Mm 'kay. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well well Mm. Be before ta talking about the money and what's possible and what is not possible  maybe Anna you can uh give our uh give us your um Yes. Evalua evaluation and also the evaluation criteria  so what what is important to look at. Mm-hmm. Well just do it quickly if if we al already. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Um  n no why not why not discuss uh discuss it now  Mm  well my my personal view is uh w when when this one is eight Euros we must think how can we improve it. And then I mean w w w you must just see it we can still spend this four and a half Euro and to r because th th th the the selling price is already prite fik uh uh quite fixed on twenty five Euros so we just have to offer as much as as well value for the for the customer uh he can have for twenty five Euro. Mm. Um well w w we can still discuss that. So um  and together with evaluating this uh we we might come with new ideas I mean adding things or uh removing uh of options because they are too expensive  but um I've received uh a framework which we can do this. I mean did you have this this Excel sheet? No okay  this is these are the the the latest prices of our production uh uh production unit for several components  so we can uh see whether the the price is is within the twelve Euro uh fifty cents uh. So maybe we can start with this  uh  calling this one. Th th this is the first design. Yes. Uh there is another pen. Okay. 'Kay. Okay. So. Look and feel. Well you already feel that uh pretty much I think. In i in my opinion purely feel is is is very good  is very good in your hand  so I I I would consider two or or may maybe even one for feel. But that's just half  we should also consider look  and then i it looks quite conventional. Don't you agree? So maybe two. Hmm. Hmm. Ma ma ma ma maybe say say five I It's my opinion  but I don't know what what Four  four. Now we th th then we settle on four. 'Kay. Can you maybe fix the other Mm  try it  just try it. Oh it will not ri mm  mm. Yes  it it has a mm. Good. Good. Okay. So then then Ah. Mm. I I I When we want to include I I I'm doubting about this this component. It it it it breaks in your Mm  yes I see  mm okay. Well r r Mm. I think the look is better but the feel is is is worse. So so I would also say this is four. But w w do you what do you think? Mm. Mm. Yes. Yes  it basically is the same shape. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes  okay. Two? Mm. Two's good yes. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. The only innova innovation is the shape. S so that Mm. Yes. A and the L_C_D_ screen is That's that's that's well it's quite innovative. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. We just diske discuss it as you designed it and then we will will try to get it in the budget. Eight. Yes. Two. Why it is one. A man w w Yes. This this is it w with the speech recognition? Well. Gi given that that it works  then it's I think one. Mm. Hmm. Three  I would. Three. No. Yeah. Yes but then when when he is used to it  i i it is quite easy. So so I think th three is good. Yeah. Good. What's the next? So Twe twenty to forty  yes that's Mm-hmm. Well exce except for the surfing shape. I mean that's that's something which which has an appeal on this group I think  but Mm w w w we after this we can can consider uh for instance  making this more attractive to to the demographic Mm. But as it is now  I w would say mm  six  something. Do you agree? Mm  yeah  indeed. Th t t Ju just think  twenty five Euros  I mean it's not going to be cheaper. Mm. Mm. Okay. Yeah tha tha tha tha tha that's I think it's better  because of the L_C_D_ screen which is really an appeal on the on the on the on the and on the Mm. So  the L_C_D_ screen uh attracts  yes. Because it Mm  ma maybe that's something to consider  yes  so. Wh what what No s say t two. Two? Okay  the final point  trends. Mm. Mm. I think Mm. Mm. And the then we can al yes. We can we can consider uh uh is it possible do you think  to to make a cover for s such a phone? I mean Well just with the with the flexible plastic uh I th I th I think O o or just two things which can be put on each other. Yes  exactly like it. Uh  so Maybe we can but we have to decide it  we can put the the the fancy f look of vegetables for instance  to to these covers and s now try to invest in the in in the features. Mm. Mm mm mm mm mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Yes. So so so that that would make the trends equal  so we we we really have don't have  I mean Mm. Yes  indeed. Yes. Say  say one and two. One and two. So le le let's see. So d this one has spongy but buttons? Mm  I see  yes okay. Good. Just add it. You know. Three  six  seven. Mm-hmm. We we must try to get them closer. Both in i i or we just have to choose. And adapt. Because  when we choose for this one we have to we have to make it more attractive and w when we to d for this one we have to make it more cheap. Yes  well But I'm now did y did you work with the same prices that I have here? Mm. Mm  tha Well yes  well uh re reconsider it. So let's let's try to to model this this phone in this sheet  uh what kind of energy source uh I I we didn't speak about that. It's a it's a normal battery  or Yes. Just so one battery. 'Kay. Electronics. given speech recognition I think w you should go for the less fancy chip. Yeah  yes  or sample sensor  yes. Yes  this one. Okay. Case? Um  I see I Double curve. Mm. Oh yes  we are talking about  but they have the same shape  but  actually bu So th th this would be double curves? 'Kay. Uh  plastic would be the material. Uh special colour  now we leave it to the covers. Push. Mm  yes  but Yeah th now this is per per unit  this number of components. So  one  two  three  four  five  six  seven  eight  nine  t Yes. Twelve I believe. So this comes to eighteen. So So I think but th do you agree th that thi Yes I Yes I'm I'm no I'm no I'm not sh sure. Yes I kno undes I understand what you mean  yes. Uh-huh. Both. Yes. Uh W d we have we haven't talk about a  but that's no a is very exp inexpensive I believe but it is not in the list. W ho h is this a scroll wheel or is this a a a sort of button which can be pressed on two sides uh so for higher and lower? Mm. Mm-hmm. So um We're We We could go for the for the for the for the for a simple chip  but then we can't have the the speech recognition  yes? Yes? So so w when we w a this would this would be cutting the speech recognition. Transti Say say it's regular  regular chip  and we still on fifteen  so Yes but that maybe Well we can just say one. Ca l we are just when we just want to uh to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to to fit in in twelve twelve fifty. So is it possible? Mm-hmm. No no  he he he I I Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Otherwise y you ha you have a s ve very normal uh thing like this. Mm. Mm-hmm  mm-hmm. A Mm Mm. I I think we have to come to a decision now  just I I think we we what we just do i is vote about the uh the L_C_D_ uh display so Yes. Yes. Yes. One man one vote. S so who thinks the the L_C_D_ disply display should be i should be in it? Mm. Mm-hmm mm-hmm. Mm-hmm  I know  but Yes. So uh uh having an L_C_D_ s display is just uh uh have very very limited amount of buttons. Is that acceptable? Ca can I have can the functions be implement in an You've you you agree. So hav hav having seven buttons  instead of twelve. So that wou would be cutting cutting suh say about these buttons. Mm. Mm. So um I I think we should we should cut the L_C_D_ screen. That that's that's my opinion. Just Uh where  L_C_ Okay w we now we can just uh Yes. Yes. I th I th I think w we just go for this one and that that now twelve Euros is the is is the price  okay. My m my supervisor will be glad that it's fifty cents cheaper than he expected. Okay. Okay  good. Then we the same. Thank you. That was it. I guess I have to change the pen otherwise. Will be completely different. Yeah. And do you think it's. Yeah. Yeah. So what can you? Yeah we will yeah  so I will be able to to summarize uh our meeting  but still I think uh it would be in very important if the uh as um main designer. I think we can put on the here. Uh basically w yeah we we designed the two uh items. Um  can we have a phone  can someone it's really w well designed. Yeah. 'Kay. Yep. Great. Yep. So I will start by the the basic one that uh fits into uh eight Euros actually  right  seven eight Euros  and uh well first for both they have um a special shape  maybe the designer can uh explain better than me  but uh it's like a surf board. And you you are supposed to surf to browse to surf T_V_  maybe the web  and uh it's kind of interesting shape because um unconsciously people want to s to surf when they see this stuff. And also it's not too far from um a mobile. So people are used to that kind of shape  right. Don't take care too much about the colour because w yeah we don't take yeah. So here would be basically the the the infrared uh uh led yeah L_A_ L_A_ L_E_D_  the on-off button  in red. Here would be the volume. On the on the left  okay  so easy to turn on t and off. And um so this is a very cheap version so there are maybe you can carry on uh Matthew. How can you change from V_C_R_ to uh T_V_  by the way? Okay yeah. Yeah yeah. Yeah. Seven  eight  ei eight Euros. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah actually  yeah. Play  pause. Exactly yeah. To audio and to video on demand. Yes. This is the orange button  the microphone. An yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Crazy dis designer  okay. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Yeah. Oh actually well. It's low weight. You have to see yeah yeah the the components we put inside is very low weight. So the the cost is actually a bit more  it's uh it's it's sixteen Francs. Sixteen Euros sorry. Then it's out of budget. But the the main point we we talk about that with our uh manufacturer. And they say basically that the S_R_ system would be uh something like three Francs per item so three Euros sorry. And um No no no  part of that  yeah. Yeah  yeah. Well I think th th yeah we should stick with uh a number of keys because if we add too much then it's too Locati. Location. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Functionality. Easy to use. target. No. Yeah. Yeah. Four maybe. Uh. Yeah. If you press like this not like this then you But Okay. Try a Perfect. Yeah  yeah. Yep. Wow. 'Kay maybe It's not a button it's a led  it's a Ac actually yeah it should be embedded. Yeah. Oh you can push push it again  you can push it. Yeah. And the L_C_D_ makes it better. Yeah. So I will say two. I would say two  three. Yep. Basically there is no innovation in the first one compared to what exists in the market  right? Yeah. The surf uh design. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're right. Yeah. And the And the second one is really uh state of the art  uh in terms of innovation. And um with many more functionalities  and can open and close the the bottom part. Yeah. And all the scrolling uh buttons and menu and pro programmable device behind this. Uh could put it at one or two I would say. Personally. Uh Yeah automatic speech recognition. Yeah. So Eight. Well actually we have yeah to check again yeah. Sixteen. W W un to be one what would do we nee actually  yeah  I don't see okay  one would would be without buttons . Bu Yeah. So maybe we can put one. It's using speech recognition  yeah. Yeah  one  yeah. So the first one is really standard  so everybody i including our grandmothers can use it  right? Yeah. Um  the other one is quite easy  tho though. One me um we hope maybe sometimes people get uh scared with the number of buttons. And there is a like I would say three. Or maybe four. Yeah  yeah because it's n uh it's not like a big one with uh one hundred buttons or so  This one would be uh for grandmothers. No. Yeah  grandmothers  yeah. Yeah that's true. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah because it's so important it's i it was written that it really so important  the um the the look and uh taking care of its it targets  the right range of people  right? Yeah. But w Yeah. But for us it's yeah we have a constraint that we need to sell at twenty five Euros. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And if you want to target yeah if we we wish to to sell four millions of this  I think for this audience we need absolutely the L_C_D_ screen. Yeah. Or even Even one and two. Or two. Yeah. Two yeah. Yeah. Spongy  uh  that means that it goes in in the water. Uh okay. But this one includes this feature  right? Spongy buttons. So Uh the maybe in the colour we can make it uh fruit and and veggie. Yeah. Yeah. This is possible. Yeah exactly like Nokia phones. Yeah. 'Cause sometimes look at this computer  th this laptop  it's all black  and uh it's quite conventional  and sometimes people don't like too much flashy colours like this one presented here. So maybe we could do like in the range the set of what we propose a black one  very standard one  that meets the the requirements of th such people that want really standard uh things. Yeah. Yeah  so a a point better for the for the number two. Okay. Yeah  the blue one uh spongy. Nine. Very good. Yeah  it's right  yeah that's right. So I I give yeah I just give a call with the manufacturer uh and uh I explained them and they told me this could be possible for sixteen Fr Euros. Uh unfortunately we didn't see this chip  uh Matthew  so maybe we have to recap with this one. For this one it's a normal battery. Uh sample speaker  yeah. Sample  yeah  this one. So So which one are we talking to? Well Yeah. Is it zero Franc? L_C_D_ is. It's okay. Just say L_C_D_. No but for this one it's twelve Euro. There are twelve? Wait a minute  it's not it's not double curved  it's single curved  right? Because it's there is no like. Well it's you know this curve like this so  it's w there is only is is is there is nothing like y you know in the other stuff there are yeah concave. So I think we can put um the single curved in the sixteen. That makes uh seventeen. And what are just The bt buttons  we have twelve buttons  are you sure? Yeah. So I had a bad uh bad estimation. No no no. Yes  a kind of scroll wheel. Okay  so based on that  yeah  um where is the es okay sample speaker But still  yeah it No we cannot  yeah. So But the um Yeah but if you have the near the L_C_D_ you can um choose select between um you know like uni universal between audio  T_V_ and V_C_R_  and this needs a needs a advanced chip. Right  Matthew? Or regular chip? I think yeah regular  today we you can do that with regular chip. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So. And what about the number of buttons buttons uh my Matthew? When you look at this w  this u uh item  But You cannot make a phone to your boss saying twelve fifty is really really low  no? And uh we don't want to to change that right? We we really want a L_C_D_ other otherwise we w wouldn not get the market. It's evident. Yeah. And I dunno So wha what what each of us think about the because it's measure point the L_C_D_  um Do you think it's important? Because sometimes whe when you watch the T_V_ in fact  you have a big display and maybe you don't need one more in your hands? I dunno  I'm just asking. Yeah  it's true yeah. But uh  do we want that? On the market point of view  yeah. What do you think uh  L_C_D_ is a major feature  or? You assume  you want a democratic voyt vote  right? Okay. Okay. We need to be. Yeah.. Yes. Because one yeah th show me that uh actually we could in fact we move these three buttons and have three uh possibilities for each of the three here. Here one  at the middle  and at the bottom. Okay . Okay. The speech recognition is out. Because of the budget  yeah. Yes. Yeah. Actually yeah  we we we will not need the really uh expert designers um because the amount  yeah. Thanks. Or browse. Mm. Now we are supposed to give some oper offers right now. I yeah. L_E_D_. Mm-hmm  hmm. Also so you have uh uh browsing the channels  actually so you can go up and down the channels  uh  if you have a video or something you can forward  back. Oh no no no  this is a single this this is a model with just the T_V_ one. No no just sorry  this is a standard T_V_ one  we are not talking about that. So and then we have usually there twelve keys but we know that we rel that we have only ten digits. The extra two are for uh having or giving an option for uh having more than one channel. And the other one is for the teletext or something you want to browse through from that. Actually. It's a very basic minimal thing which you can which is which is also available in the market  actually that's what it that it i and would cost us to build it about eight Euros. Yeah. Yeah. So this one model and uh yeah. Sure. Th this is a magic one but I know we don't want to talk about that  you know like uh i i i it is a very futuristic  it's like uh it's like a brain machine interface and all this stuff we are thinking about in the future  it can come. So that uh then what we look t yeah. This is a model  yeah. Yep. Uh so well then the this is the a more a little uh smooth and it gives a lot of functionality  uh in this way  so all we have uh th you see there are only six keys  but don't worry they are ma they are doing the job of twelve keys actually here. And so they have more space actually and uh it's easy to uh use this and uh you have um so this is a standard uh uh infrared eye  and then you have a power button  which l volume  what you have  and then other than that you have uh channel up and down and uh f slow pause or s slow lo yeah s pause or stop  and uh then uh you can uh you have a L_C_D_ display  here and uh y this is a functional thing which can change like it's a toggle switch which could change the function say  y you press it Yeah. I really can change it  so Instead of having many switches  y The L_C_D_ can display what is that on that  and uh well you can have a integrated microphone over here  or in the button th here  so which can uh basically you want to do a speech recognition and uh that channel a lot of information can be di displayed here directly on the um on your on your display. And here is a small L_E_D_ which is like blinking one  which tells you like uh are you running out of the battery  and which is can be useful for the locating as I was talking earlier okay. And uh well then we have a cover basically  basically you don't need much of the time this  when you need you can use it  and this gives additional functionality that tomorrow you want you can add a tactile thing to this cover you know. Design enter. Yeah. Yeah. It's basically to do that. Actually when you are watching the T_V_  when you are watching anything or listening to them  you hardly care about what is getting displayed here  you know  uh you want to uh and this gives a protection to the L_C_D_ actually  giving a cover to that actually. Gives a protection because when it falls down or something it it is it is is is it gives a protec it's more robust that way. Uh yeah. And you have very good chances Yeah. Yeah. It Sixteen Euros. Yeah. Three Euros. Part of that. Yeah. Well uh if you we can have if you have new more ideas we can add new more uh some more keys if you want to you know Yeah it it should not be cluttering up everything. Ah that's for the it's kind of a L_E_D_ for indicating your battery and as well as it's like a blinking one you know you can keep it aside. Yeah. And now it easy to use. No. Mm yeah. Well I will give it maybe we have anyways the way we have designed it's like the surf as you say you know. It though the look is fine but uh still I will give four in that case you know. Four yeah that Yeah. I will gi yeah. No. C can you get the batteries? No no the battery has fallen down  that's i Yeah. No no it's not that  it's how to close a battery. Okay? Now it should be. Is there another battery there? Oh yeah. No actually this is this is not going to protrude actually  it it's n i it is jus It's a led actually which which 'll be covering in a curve It's will be embedded there so it won't be really you know protruding or something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No you it it not protruding actually  it will go in better into that Uh it's fine I think. My just that um the feel is that um you right now you you don't see the feel because right uh for example if you press it quite inside now like this  now it's embedded one. This is how embedded one will Yeah. It's a bas basically the same thing actually. You will be Except that in this c Yeah. And you might have a slight thing for to forward and Yeah  yeah. Yeah. looking like No but except for the design of the surf. You should be rea Uh no I think it's more of the feel. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Say about that. Yeah. Yep. Yeah  it gives it Yep. No  we ha Yeah  eight Euros yeah. Sixteen Euros. It's a two  I would say two. Yeah. Okay yeah. Uh He is used to it act They are used to it actually. Here there may Uh  though it has more functionality I think it shouldn't be for the user to learn it actually. It shouldn't be diffi Uh yeah  actually in fact I think it will be Yeah Yeah but y Well we have reduced the keys actually you see. Three is fine with me. Yeah it's a actually the user has to put some effort to do use that actually  it's not so easy  like this one the normal. Is quite easy yeah. Initially there there is a lot of effort  yeah. Mm. Oh no  this would I I would I would give this model to the old people actually. Yeah. And Oh yeah . I Well I think Yeah. Uh yeah but but if you sell it in the market it's going to be cheap  actually. So And people can still decide to use the cheaper one instead of a Okay. Okay. So in that case well it's fine then. We can yeah. And the demographics of Yeah I think it's uh it has more market actually. Y yeah  you know two. Yeah two yeah. Because tomorrow this will be more appealing because you can add lot of sophistication on that. Because then you you have it uh d you have lot of things which you can include for the people to We have to practically test it. The field test will tell you how good. The trends. Mm-hmm. Yeah I know. Yeah. We we we we we yeah  it's the way they are going to be  actually. But why do you want to cover that actually? In that uh w in the mod Uh uh y are you sure? Yeah I think yeah it should be possible like what we do with the mobile phone  yeah. Yep. Yeah  it's one. Yeah  it says a One point six  one point One point eight yeah. Four point Uh four point two. Wow. Yeah. Yep. Maybe we ought to reconsider everything with this  yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah  it migh It it'll need uh more than a conventional one  it won't be uh just maybe you might use a A_A_ battery actually. What do you say  Mael? Yeah. Curved. Double curved yeah right. It's uh Are you talking about this or that? Mm-hmm. Yeah. A special colour? Uh Ah good. Yeah  we might need a scroll wheel  right  for that? No  for that one also. Yeah that's a scroll. Yeah  one scroll wheel you might need. Uh Bad estimate  right? That is the sample sensor and sample speaker. We just need that actually. We need one. S Oh I i it I think it's going to be y y yeah it's th with the regular chip  yeah. Yeah. Uh Yeah. That'll be then we have uh have to ask the user to press it several times. Uh Or we could even replace them by buttons actually. A actually it depends  it depends what kind of functionalities you want to add into it  for example if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons  or and you'll have L_C_D_ display which is that is going to bring the cost by two two Euros at least. Okay so we can get rid of it and then add a couple of buttons. I think but Yeah but the only thing is that what is the multiple functionalities you want to include with that. Yeah. W I I I just Yeah. That will create another problem. For the people to use it. It's not going to be easy. Doing that. No  it's okay  you uh cut the L_C_D_ screen and introduce two more buttons. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That's it. Cool. Did you get my email with the slides? Ah. Tricky. Dunno. Maybe they're supposed the pen's supposed to go over the seats. Might be seat floor rather than person. Yeah  put it back. Yep. Yeah. Jo's making faces at me. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm  object tracking. Okay. Well we can't no we can't do evaluation 'til we have a design. Mm-hmm. Mm 'kay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Oh yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay so it's it's t a very basic remote then  it's only Mm. Mm. Can I see? Thanks. Okay I like the volume control  that's good. Uh-huh. So it doesn't actually have buttons. Did you wanna see? Mm. It won't talk back. Right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. So it's well outside the budget then. That's on top of the sixteen  or is it part of that? So that takes it down to thirteen Euros without the speech recognition. Mm-hmm. Mm. What's this one on the side? Ah okay. Mm-hmm. Mm 'kay. I like the shape of them  I do like the the size and the the shape. Mm-hmm. Okay. And maybe we run the evaluation on both of the products  both of these two. Okay. Basically this is what we've talked about already  um  from the marketing point of view. We just wanna make sure that we've taken into account Yep. So it's just a shortlist of criteria on um the things that we've identified as being important to selling the product. Um we just go through these and rate them as a group and then at the end we'll make an evaluation based on that  so just average the score of those items  so These are the things we identified as being important. Um the three things were look and feel  innovation and ease of use  were the three important components um appealing to the correct demographic so using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic. And then goin following the company motto  following the fashion trends and putting that into the product as well. So well do you wanna go through and put through those on the the two products now or do we wanna discuss them further and then evaluate them? Okay. So f just go through onto the whiteboard I guess. Not sure how this is gonna come out. So the first one was really very far below budget  would you want to take the price down of the end product according to that or just have the high profit on it? 'Cause if we're only going to make it for eight Euros then we have a Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yep. Mm-hmm. Okay so look and feel  innovation Mm-hmm. And trends. Oh  you following the idea of using the um removable covers on these? Is that part of both of them or? Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Yep. So it's the pink. And the other one's green. Okay  so look and feel? Where um one is I've broken the pen again. S yeah. Get that one. Um w one's bad and seven's the best. Sorry  one's true and seven's false. One's the best. So on a scale of one to seven? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm  yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. On the scale u it's between functional and fancy basically we're looking at  so Mm-hmm. Four? Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm. No that's the ink's dried. Battery's low  isn't it the ink? The b that's the that that one? battery there. Mm. No I think it's lost a battery. No it's It would still write but it wouldn't pick it up with the sensors. You got a second? Well we won't be able to tell. Is that working? Did it come out? Good. Okay. Because we'll be able to see it still even if it wasn't working  it's just a normal whiteboard marker but it wouldn't be picked up on the the actual whiteboard. And the other one? I think it's slightly better  um  it's hard to tell from just the plasticine  but Mm. Mm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. The other thing is  is the left hand one protruding? 'Cause if people are left handed they want to use the other hand  maybe it won't work so well. Okay. I'd say two or three for that one  personally. Probably more towards three than two. Okay. Mm  okay. Yeah it's d it's definitely more fancier than that one. Okay. So  consensus? Two or three? Two? Um  'kay. Innovation. The first one  not really muc Mm. Yeah. Do we Mm. What What features are we actually including? Are we including like a location kind of thing like trying to find it? There's nothing like that? But th is there any there's no actual innovation in that at all  it's just a straight-out remote control. Okay. Okay. So there's no this uh look and feel thing  though that's not a technological innovation. So I'd be up for seven for innovation. Okay. So what is it  what are the innovations with this? Got the L_C_D_ screen. Is that in this one though? Is this 'cause this is the Th th there were different options we discussed then  we discussed the one that was in budget and the one that was out of budget. Okay. So the cost for these were what was the cost for the first one? Eight Euros? And this one was sixteen Euros. Okay. So. Innovation for this one is two? One? Two? Mm. Well the speech recognition is a very good innovation I believe it  so Give it a one? Yep. Okay. Ease of use? Mm. Yeah. Yep. So that's maybe a a two for ease of use. Okay. So maybe a three or a four. Mm. Okay. Consensus? Three or four? Three? Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. So three's uh how well it goes to the target demographic. So we're d we're still thinking twenty to forty year olds? That's Mm. So sh completely changed our demographic there  it's not part of the the funky young thing. Yeah. If it was the very bottom price range or it was like between this and another one we did the same thing then I can imagine it being applying to the the demographic yeah. That's it's still Ye Mm. 'Cause we have got room  we've got some budget there to add a few things to it  that's right. Mm-hmm. And Mm. But it's going to be cheap whatever though  it was set with i we've got a set price. Yeah. There's nothing that would make me spend an extra k few Euros on that one rather than another one. Okay. Um and the demokraphi demographic of the second one? It's got the got the the toys in it  it's got the L_C_D_ screen and Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think especially if we're gonna n have an L_C_D_ screen on a low range product then that's good. Mm. Okay. I'd probably go with three again for that one. Mm-hmm. Okay. So  two  yeah? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yep. And especially I guess 'cause this has the speech recognition as well  and that makes it more appealing  it's more of a a new fun toy. Mm-hmm. Okay. And following the trends. So the trends were the fruit and vegetables and the spongy feel. So as it is  not really doing either of them. Well  the spongy could be part of the the feel of the buttons as well  I know some have you tried the mobile phones that have got the kinda spongy buttons and not not exactly spongy but I'm thinking one of the Nokias that's got like you ca it hasn't got individual buttons it's got just a one bit on it and so you can that feels kinda spongy. So it's sort of  yeah. Mm. Okay. But that's if you're using the covers. Or is it just one Well they make it for mobiles  it can't be that much more complicated. So you got the option of having different colours or different textures. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. I think the if we do the cover that's really going with the company's philosophy of having the fashion in in electronics  it lets people have the latest fashion even next year when fruit and vegetables might be out  you'll still be able to put a new cover on it and then it'll still be in fashion. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yep. Yep. Mm. And then you have the option of having the different colours  different covers. Mm. There's n yeah. 'Cause that's the that's the feature that could be included in either of them. Although it is more with the spongy buttons on the um on the other one. Okay. So. Two and three  or one and two? Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay so the average of that is three six nine divided by five  so five mm nine by five  one point s eight? This one  eleven thirteen nineteen twenty one  divided by five is four point two yep. Okay. But we still got a very different price for those two so they're not really comparable yet anyway. Yep. Yep. Mm-hmm. Well it's easier to just make that one cheaper by just taking the speech recognition out. That'll basically take us down to the budget. Mm. Yeah  it's gonna be more than just the biggest case  definitely. Either of them. Mm. They're both going to be not basic cases. Mm-hmm. Yeah. The basic one  yep. So now we're either going button or L_C_D_s  L_C_D_ display. Is that price per unit  or for the whole thing? So it would need twelve buttons. Mm. And that's without any special button supplements. So we'd have a special colour  special form and special material on all of them. They're not just standard buttons. But I thought it would be curved on two it's like it's curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as well  that's what I thought. You talking about concave curves? You think a single curved? Mm. We have more  we've got those the scroll wheel on the side and yeah The sc Mm. We've got a scroll wheel for the volume don't we  or is it some other thing that's not on there. 'Kay we've only got five minutes left guys so we need to wrap it up pretty fast. So this is even more than the um than the cost you gave  the sixteen Euros. But that's seven basic buttons right  seven buttons without any adds-on  without special colours or form or material. Well So the L_C_D_ display is is three Francs  sorry three Euros  by itself. Mm. So twelve Euro fifty  we got two off of the battery  we can't do anything about that  so ten fifty  if we want an L_C_D_ dispra display  that's seven fifty um  so we've got seven fifty to use for the case and for the buttons. And the chip. Sorry the chip's up there already. So we're gonna have to scale this down to get within budget  there's no doubt about that. Mm. Yep. Mm. Yeah. I think  unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the L_C_D_ display. For the price  it's gonna be what we can afford  and it's looking like we can't afford the L_C_D_ display  there's no way we can get it in there. Mm. Mm-hmm. I th I'd like t it to be in but I can't see it happening. I can't see it fitting in. Bu y you're a power voter uh veto anyway as Project Manager. well we have to make a decision now  that's it. Mm. I think then we we're really losing ease of use. Okay. Okay. So L_C_D_'s out  is speech rec out now? We've Yep. Yep. So are we basically back to the original one now  back to the first version? Which turns out to be on budget exactly  pretty much. With these new costings. So just look at forget that one and look at that one now. Mm. Yep. Okay. Well that's that's Yep. So. Mm. Yep. So w we can go back and l talk to the suppliers maybe and see if we can drive the prices down to add a few more things in but that's all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment. Mm-hmm. Okay. ,The Project Manager presented the project to the other participants by discussing the aim of creating a new  fashionable remote control device and defined the roles and tasks of each participant. The group introduced themselves to each other and trained themselves how to use the whiteboard tools. The Project Manager discussed the financial goals of the project  including the projected profit aim and price point for the device. The Project Manager gave each participant their assignments. The group then began a discussion of their initial ideas about the remote control and possible features. The Project Manager announced that he would make a report containing the discussion of the group's initial ideas about the device. 
Wow  good expression. Well after us. Actually  I'm ready to sell it. I'm ready to sell it. No y no no no  the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard  extremely hard wood  but there are some very pretty woods out there. That's actually very innovative idea. Well  it's actually a very innovative n different idea that uh you know you can choose your colour of wood  your type of wood. I mean it's each person is gonna have their own personalised  individualised speech recognition remote control in wood  that's not on the market. In turns of wow. Wood? They do that anyway with the rubber and plastic  so  and chew 'em up. And chew 'em up. No. Hmm. Simple design. It's what consumers want. It's almost like  Houston  we have a product here. Problem is obviously gonna be cost. Okay  I also have a f very simple presentation  because for the marketing point you have to see what the consumers want. I also have uh copied a different type of remote. If you can find me  where I'm at. There should only be one in here. trend watch. It's being modified. They're stealing our product. We've been giving simple questionnaires in different areas because th obviously we have to see what the com consumers are looking for today  'cause uh trends change very very quickly. In six months maybe this idea is already gone out the window  so it's gonna be a question how fast we can act. Uh they already erased the rest of mine  huh. No no  no no. 'Cause I had another comment there. Uh the market trend. This is what we know from the last uh from the questionnaires from the the all the p surveys we've done  fancy and feel-good  that's what we've been looking for  something that feels good in the hand  that's easy to use. Looking for next generation of innovation  because all the remotes out there now  they're all very similar  they all do the same thing  we have to have something completely different. Okay? Easy to use  has always has become has become another major interest that uh  with the whiteboard we can see that it's a remote that's easy to use. And I think this is another thing that's interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology. So even if we have a product that may be more expensive  if it comes out right  if they look it looks and feels good and has technology. The second two  you can see the last one is a very easy simple design. The second one  there is about uh forty-five thousand different buttons on it  which makes it fairly hard to read  uh very hard to use. The first one  I see that they put in a display. Now there's something else uh with the little flip-up  now we're adding all kinds of things in  but with the little flip-up  if you have a little display on the flip-up that when you close it everything is locked. Maybe the display also makes it easier to use  because sometimes when you're looking for buttons  maybe if you see a display Okay Because I've seen mostly the standard ones  yeah. Now you have it now you have one with the very simple also. The idea is simple  but with a display  so you can see what you're doing. So maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use  trendy  fancy  feels good  uh with a display  wood  designer wood  designer colours  we might've Mm-hmm. How hard they squeeze? Resistance resistance  right. No  but incorporating the three uh obviously it'd be something totally new on the market  totally different and from Although  what it was it uh it was uh Nokia that came out with this changeable colours. Right  you take it apart  and put on another face  take it off and put on another face and then they sold millions  millions. So. So say with the f with the findings  with the research  easy to use something totally new. We have to come up with something totally new that is not on the market. Where w Where it would be manufactured is is another step. We're here to design  come up with a nice product. No. No no p spec It's 'cause we have to find out cost on it. Um  no that's no problem. I'm here for the pushing it after it's made. I will market it. Once we get a price on it then we can market it. Nice beautiful mahogany red wooden case. And marketing strategy  thank you. Fired. Okay. So uh  if you could open the PowerPoint presentation. I'm number two. Components design  there we go. So uh can we put it in slide show mode? Yeah. Right here  is that little that one  yes please. Thank you. I'll take the mouse. So uh we were looking he specifically at the components uh the following components  uh the case  the power supply  uh the means of communications with the television set. In instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition  you have to have microphone well no you don't actually I haven't have to have microphone in the device  but um maybe you do have it a a way it has to it has to hear the speaker and um  so it could be in the television set  could be in the device  but somewhere you have to put the microphone  um and a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it's gets lost. Um so the other w thing that we So. Our method for going about this is we've looked at uh the histo hi historical record  what's worked  what hasn't and then we also um we wanted to evaluate some new materials and we contacted manufacturing for their input because  course  we m might come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us  so uh this is the approach that we took during our um our research. So um for the case  um we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design. Course  you know  I wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable  but um that uh doesn't seem to b be one of the choic non-option we can uh we can really seriously explore  so then we were thinking about um rubber  but um unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat uh factor and th um there might be some problems with the m uh how it's uh goes with the board. Uh and uh then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle it gets brittle after a while  so um we still had titanium and and wood available  but um unfortunately uh uh titanium's also been eliminated uh  the m people in manufacturing said that you couldn't make d curved cases out of titanium  although how Apple did it with th PowerBook I'm not su quite sure but uh nevertheless um they've eliminated all of our options except wood. So  this is our finding. And a as she said  it's an environmentally friendly uh material  so we're we're currently uh proposing  uh we'll get to all my personal preferences in just a second. So then there's this other matter of the chips and um well we could use a simple design on the board  but uh these simple chips  but that's only works for the bu you don't get very much um intelligence with this simple one. And um then there was the regular which I regret that I've forgotten exactly why I'm eliminating that one. Uh the other option was this advanced chip on print  and uh we liked th we we found that it it includes this infrared sender  which w 'member the beam was that was an important component of finding the right chip. And uh manufacturing has told us that they've um uh recently developed a uh a sensor and a speaker that would uh be integrated into this advanced chip on print  so uh we we uh now jumping right to our personal preferences um I I'd really think we should  you know  use some of uh some really exotic woods  like um  you know uh  well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods. I think that people will might really want to design their own cases  you see  they could do sort of a this um three-dimensional design on the internet  and then they could submit their orders  kinda like you submit a custom car order  you know  and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather and things like that  and then I uh think we should go with the solar cells as well as the um microphone and speaker on the advanced chip. So this is the findings of our research and my recommendations um for the new remote control w um would be to have um have it be made out of wood. Do you have any problems with that? I'm not sure  how do I Oh  I know  let's see. Let's go back up here. I think it's um um a multiple uh chip design um and it's uh maybe printed on to the circuit board. Uh I could find out more about that uh before the next fi next meeting. I don't know  but I'll find out more at our next meeting. Sounds good. Because um it gets brittle  cracks Um We want we expect these um uh these remote controls to be around for several hundred years. So. Good ex Good expression. I don't know  speak for yourself  I'm planning to be around for a while. you're what? You think? And you could you could sell oils with it  to take care of it. Well I'm glad you Okay  good. Sorr having a hard time keeping wi control over my face. Mm-hmm. Mm. She works in the cubicle next to me so she's uh she was already a little bit prepared for this. Luckily Ed was not. Mm-hmm. Yeah  you wouldn't wanna have to have splinters in your hand while you're using your It's really good if your dog gets ahold of it  they can use it for teething. Yeah  they do it with other materials as well  yeah. Oh  I'm sorry. Right  my hand is uh different size than yours for example. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. A hinge. Be like a copper hinge or you know. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm  mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Sure. No  f go to findings. Context-sensitive instructions  depending on what the tel what mode the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ or something else is in. You know  maybe what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like um a uh uh b some sort of a foam rubber um ball  and then they would squeeze it  and it would take the shape of their hand. To t an and then you would know like um what the geometry of their hands would be and uh Yes you'd know what kind of wood to get. That's right  that's right  you wouldn't wanna go too far down that. Oh that that actually would uh increase the um the revenues we could expect  yeah. Mm-hmm. Right  mm. We'd also have to wor um consider that uh who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes  we might wanna um learn about um labour laws. You know in different countries and stuff wher so we can do it cheap  but you don't wanna exploit uh labour in um third world countries. So actually you could turn it y turn around and say that you're uh par the reason the cost is high for the device is because um you're paying a a working wage to the person who made the device. Cost of living is low. Good  well th that'd be something that manufacturing would have to um explore more and to where Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. What do you think Ed? Do you he liked the display in one of the concepts that you showed  um  do you know how much it costs  um  to to add a little display like this uh? Do you wanna take an action item to go find out? Okay. Sorry about that. So the the advanced chip on print is what um what we've we've deci we've determined and the uh engineering industrial design is the recommendation  and um I think we've kinda come to some agreement regarding um this concept of a wooden case. A customisable and Uh I don't think so  no  I think they could be rubber like they are now  so you have that tactile experience of So um are we done with this meeting? And a marketing strategy. Mm-hmm. At least it's environmentally friendly. Thank you. Yeah. Why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material? Mm-hmm. Whic Which Although I think I think with wood though you'd run into the same types of problems  wouldn't you  I mean it chips  it if you drop it  uh it's I'm not su I think if you re if you use really good quality wood  then it might work  but you can't just use Yeah  exactly  yeah. The stain. Um  in terms of comments on this or in terms of my own Y yeah. I think we can get the quality materials then it shouldn't influence the design principles too much  which you'll see with my presentation. One thing we'd have to check though is what the users whether how quickly the novelty wears off of having uh Yeah  for example. So  have to see how kid-friendly it is and and all that  but Sure. One point three  yeah. Uh  yeah. I think so  yeah. Yeah  that's the one. So  it's a very short presentation  'cause I'm actually gonna draw you the layout on the board so if you want to just go straight to the second slide  um  which basically shows  sort of I took the ideas that we were talking about last time um and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch  volume and channel control  the menu access button  ergonomic shape  which I completely agree with Christine's idea to have it sort of molded  so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls. And actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea  is that people can actually do sort of quasi-measurements on their hand size  so if someone has larger hands  you have a wider remote control. So  that's actually a really good idea for customi customisability. Um  one thing I thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it  just like you have on flip phones  so that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it  especially if you have little kids around  they're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch a T_V_ show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off. And also um you had issues with the batteries running out  so I thought maybe we could put a little battery life-light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is starts to die. And in terms of invisible features  audio and um tactile feedback on button presses and  like you said  speech recognition. So  in terms of what this thing would actually look like Despite working in interface design  I'm not the greatest artist in the world  so you'll have to forgive me. You'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big  sort of in the corner and by itself  so you don't accidentally turn your T_V_ off while you're trying to manoeuvre other buttons. And then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for  oops  channels and volume  sort of for surfing channels and then volume  so the volume would be the up and down  'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to right. And then here you'd have your sort of standard  telephonish number pad. And then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your T_V_ and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control. So that if the user doesn't want to use their voice  they can just turn it off and you don't have the remote control accidentally changing things on you. Um  so again you can have a little L_C_D_ light somewhere  the flip thing and Have I forgotten anything? I don't think so. So  as you can see  it's a very very simple design  which is one of the things I really wanted to keep  is keep it simple  not have too many buttons  not have too many functionalities thrown into it. Think the design can pretty much carry over to everything  although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different. Yeah. But you also have to d start watching out for the weight  'cause depending on how much the the flip screen will add to the weight of the remote control  you don't want it to start getting too heavy. But that's the general layout with the general functionalities  if we come up with something else. As you can see  there's still lots of space on the actual remote control and if you do it customisably  you can make this thing fairly small or fairly o large  depending on personal preferences. So  that's pretty much all I had to say  I mean  everything else in terms of design issues. Um the centering of the key pad and the channel is just depending on where your thumb is and you tend to use the the volume control and uh the browsing more than the actual number pad  so that would be sort of in direct line of where your thumb goes when you are holding the remote control  the number pad a little bit lower 'cause it's used less frequently. So once we decide exactly what we want  then we can figure out the exact positioning  but more or less I think it should go along those lines. Mm-hmm. Yeah. No  no. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Right. Especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Oh yeah. Yeah  so it's really molded to to your specific But th for that you'd also have to do sort of an average across families and things like that if unless everyone has their own personal remote. The sales  yeah. Yeah. Well  already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick. Yeah. Yeah. And that took off  yeah  yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I think it depends  I mean I think it's a good idea  but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be because theoretically with the T_V_ you already have a big display right in front of you. So  if we're trying to keep costs down  then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go. I mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for very specifically what it would be used for  'cause if it's only used for one little thing  then putting in a big display case or a big display that's probably expensive just to do the training on the chip for the speech recognition or whatever  may not be the most cost-efficient way to go  but that's just sort of speculation  I mean. Mm-hmm. What about the buttons  would Would the buttons be wood too  or Mm-hmm. Okay. Sure. No. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Uh welcome back after lunch  I hope uh you had a good lunch together. For uh this meeting the main agenda okay uh to discuss about the conceptual design meeting. Okay and the agenda will be the opening and uh that's uh the product manager or secretary that's me and uh the presentations from the Christine and uh Agnes and from Mister Ed. And finally in this meeting we have to decide and we are to take a decision on the remote control concept and uh the functional design So we have forty minutes  I think it's uh little bit uh low  but I I hope we can finish it up so I'll handle to the the functional team  to the Christine  okay  to discuss about uh the components concept. You're number two. 'Kay The next one. Can you go back uh one slide? Yes  uh question  uh  what's mean exactly  advanced chip on print? What's the meaning of that? Mm-hmm. Yeah  is it means it's on the yeah is it on a micro-proc micro-processor based or uh Okay  tha that would be great  so if you find out from the technology background  okay  so that would be good. So so you're not convinced about the the wood  yes. Yeah  so it it's looks good the the design the functional design uh  what about yo you? Yes  in t yes  in term in terms of comments first Okay then  uh  let's move to Agnes. S you're You are in participant three. This one? So what's your  uh  the comments or uh s Okay Mm-hmm. Yeah. The Yeah. I hope so. Yeah. Yeah  but we can get a production in  uh  countries like  uh  India yes  yes  countries like India or China or Malaysia  so you can go a better features and better price and you can sell more. So Yeah  yeah  so Yes. So Yeah  so Yes uh  but uh that that we can that we can talk about the production later  okay  depends on the the quantity  okay. So we don't need to have our own uh fabric factory or something  so we can have a tie-up with who the do the fabric  okay  for the different uh electronics items  then we can have a business tie-up and to get to cut the cost  okay  to sell more. So  but uh le let's decide first about the components concept and uh interface concept  okay  if is acceptable for both of you  what uh Ed was talking. And your design whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple  so Yeah. Yes. I don't think so. Yes. Yes. Don't looks nice uh. Yeah  so uh what we'll do is  uh  we will stick with the the simple design for time being until uh th Ed find outs about the how much it's cost to the extra  in case we go for the display. Okay. So maybe what you can do is uh  both of you  you can come up with the the prototype  okay  the model. Okay? Yeah  I hope  if is it okay if uh they will come up with the prototype design  okay. Then they can show you how it looks like  and then we can uh submit to the I will submit to the management. Okay? Then meantime you can come up with the price  how much it's cost as extra for uh the display. An and the marketing strategy  that's very important  okay. Yes. How much you can how mu how much how much you can sell extra. Of course you'll make money too  so it it's not only pay-out  you make money too  your commission. Okay  so  any questions? So  by next meeting  so  please come up with the the prototype  okay  then uh  then we can proceed from there. It's okay? So thanks for all your uh efforts and coming for the meeting again  and see you soon then. Okay? Thank you. ,The Marketing Expert presented more information on user requirements which showed that users wanted the look of a high-tech device that was still simple to use. She presented the fruit and vegetable fashion trend that the group will integrate into their design. The User Interface Designer presented several ideas for the interface design taken from existing product designs. The Industrial Designer discussed the necessary internal components and presented options for energy sources and materials. The User Interface Designer also presented the sample speaker technology recently developed by the company. The group had a discussion to finalize the prototype features. It was decided that the device will be small with a locator function instead of having a charging stand. Voice recognition will not be included outside of the locator function. It will be covered by interchangeable latex casings. To incorporate the company logo and color  the buttons will be illuminated yellow when pressed and the logo will be displayed through the latex casings. The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to build the prototype  with the User Interface Designer deciding which buttons will be included. The Marketing Expert will prepare a prototype evaluation. 
Good to see you all again. Let's see if that comes up. This is our functional design meeting. Um. Just a sec while my PowerPoint comes up. Et voila. Okay. Mm um we put the fashion in electronics. Let's start. Okay  our agenda today um just check the time  it's twelve thirteen. Um. I'm gonna do an opening  talk about um did you all get the minutes? I e-mailed them to you. I'm also putting 'em them in the shared folder. So um then I we'll talk about our general objectives and have your three presentations. Um I'll talk about the new project requirements I've just received  and then we have to make a decision on our remote control functions. Finally we'll just close. We're starting this meeting at approximately twelve thirteen and we have forty minutes. So First of all the functional design objectives. Uh we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification  what needs and desires are to be fulfilled  the functions design  what effects the apparatus should have  and the working design  how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function. Okay  three presentations  um you can go in any order you choose um. Sure  please do. Yes I do. Yeah. Function  F_ eight  yeah. The blue one  F_N_. Is it plugged in all the way and you screwed it in and Mm 'kay. It's taking it a little bit 'Kay there you go. Press the little presentation. It's the um it looks like a Y_ kind of over there above Draw. There  that one  there you go. Thank you very much. That was that was great. Um 's move on to the next presentation um on effects. Was that you? Great. Push. User interface  right. Interface. Mm 'kay  thank you. Okay. Hmm. Hmm. Mm 'kay. Thank you very much. That was very useful. It's funny to see the drastic difference between those two remotes. Um. And neither of them were very pretty  you know? Mm. Mm. You there it is. Lovely. Hmm. Um the it's right above Draw. There are three thingy if it's way at the bottom. Under three icons and it's the one that looks like a desk. Yeah  that one. There are Y_s. You just press yeah  just click. That'll be fine. Um yeah use that thing you can go back  previous. Pardon. Oh  well. Okay. Ye Double click on it. With the right with the left hand one. There we are. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Excellent. So  um. Yes  absolutely. Ah I can never tell which way to turn these things. Lefty loosey  righty tighty  right? Lefty loosey  righty tighty. Oh yes. Mm 'kay. Um I have nothing on my screen. Just a sec. Here we are. Okay  yeah  it's fine. Okay  requirements. We have a couple new requirements that I was just e-mailed right before the meeting and that we have to keep in in um in mind as we're creating this. We didn't bring it up yet  or at all in the meetings so far  but we're not gonna work with teletext because um well it that's been taken over by the internet  so we're not gonna worry about um we're not gonna worry about that. Um. It no. W d could would you care to explain it? How? Okay. Interesting. Okay um  well  we're not gonna the management has decided we're not gonna work with that. Um Okay um and we're also gonna w like your question earlier um whether this is going to be t for television  video  or etcetera. Just for television. That's what we're focused on. Um otherwise becomes to complex  we wanna get this out um very quickly. We only have a a short amount of time. Um and finally there's more marketing  I think  um  our corporate image has to be recognisable. So while we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use our colour and our slogan i in the new design. Looks like  yeah  kind of a yellow and black and we have that the emphasis on the R_s in um mm-hmm. But it's  yeah  we put the um fashion in electronics. So we gotta keep that in that in mind. Yep. Yep. Yeah  or ha maybe some buttons could be yellow. Like  we can we can play around with it a little bit. Um. Okay  we need to talk about our functions and our target group. We need to decide who our target group is. You um in your analysis of different market um of the marketing  you identified that different groups wanted different things or had certain preferences  for example that um that older people didn't really care for um voice recognition  but younger people did. Um and so who are we aiming this at? Mm-hmm. It's gonna be twenty five Euro remember  so um it has to be avai marketable to um whomever it is. Well at least right now what we're doing is um deciding on just the remote itself  so it will probably be sold separately  twenty five Euro by itself. Now  those are that's all specific for speech recognition. Are we gonna use that as one of our functions? Mm-hmm. Mm. To produce it  yes. Mm. That's a good thing to keep in mind. Upgrade? Well  we can look for we can look at upgrade or we can look at um user-friendly. Simplification  so Uh-huh  mm. And we also need to talk about if we're only gonna have the very simple ones or also have the other ones just separate somehow or Kind of pull out of the side. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Um we have to be careful that that that doesn't impede um the chip transmitting information  but um that's gonna be mostly technological thing. Um. Okay um  so what are we emphasising? I what in this project? Simplicity and fashion. Okay  those are very good goals  I think  um that we have to keep in mind in with everything we do. Simplicity and fashion and  yeah  or usability speci however you wanna say that  which includes um an emphasis on making the infra-red very functional  so that you don't have to travel around a lot. Um. I think it's a lot to do with battery  but that's just my Mm-hmm. So our target group  we're saying  fifteen to thirty five? S voice recognition  which I kind of I kind of feel like voice recognition is not necessary in a remote control  like it might be necessary for a T_V_ but not for the remote c  you know. Seems a little bit Mm-hmm. Yeah  and it might be too expensive. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Under sixty five  okay  that's a good start. Um. I'd say we're uh can we narrow it down to maybe um teenagers and families? 'Cause that would go up to like fifty? Okay  single It's it's hard to narrow it down. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So maybe it's more useful to d d to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is because  yeah  things so different will appeal to different people  but Okay. Um oh  there're a couple functions do we want something so that do we want some kind of thing to find it if it's lost? Like a button on a T_V_ you can press and it'll ring or something  I don't know like or beep? Mm-hmm. Mm. Okay  we have to we have about four minutes left to define our functions. So let's do that quickly. Um so we want something to keep it from getting lost. And we want um we want large buttons for the essential things. Large  accessible buttons for the essentials. We want a possibility to um to get um a possibility to get the extra functions. Mm-hmm. Um  yeah  hidden way. And we also want it to be fashionable  which I'm not sure if that's a function so much as a um yeah Mm-hmm. Okay  do it. Any other essential functions that we need? Battery? Do we need a long-life battery? But we might as well. Yeah  I would imagine. Just 'cause it is an electronic device  the Charging. Mm-hmm. We have to think about um space in living-rooms  too  like 'cause they're I mean  would you put it on top of the T_V_? I don't know  just think okay  that's that's a good idea  we'll keep it. Think it's And maybe fun. Okay. Um 'kay we're gonna conclude now  has everyone said their functions and 'kay. Um after the meeting we're gonna each complete a sks um a questionnaire and a summaries summary. I don't know what summarisation. Um and then we'll have our lunch break. After that we have thirty minutes of individual work. Um I'll make sure to put up um the minutes and the project documentation and including these PowerPoint slides. If everyone could do that as well  that'd be great. Um you each have individual actions  I_ um I_D_ Industrial Design you've your components concept  User Interface  the user interface concept  market trend wa watching. And as as per last time you'll get specific incrat instructions from your personal coach e-mailed to you. And hopefully  I hope  next time you'll be able to access more of the web site that they they seem to tell you that you could. It's kinda frustrating  but um Be sure to note any frustrations or any um issues that come up in your um in your um summary. Mm 'kay? Great seeing y'all. Looks like there are um looks like there's a second one kind of of mine that's that I didn't do  it's from like an earlier project  I think so um Under the shared folder  I don't know it might not even be under yours as well. Projects. Okay. You don't have mine? S Mm. Okay. Well I'll figure that out in the meantime. Okay. Yep. Well there's a wee a wee plug just just that one there Ah that's it  yep. And then you have to press function F_ eight I think it is on your laptop. That's it. Repetitive strain injury. Repetitive strain injury. So if you Cheers. Here we go. Right so I'm gonna talk about the technical technical functions design of the remote control um. We need to start by considering what a remote control actually is. It's a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television  so i it's basically a communication device. We we tell the remote control what we want to do  it sends a message to the television saying change the channel  change the volume  uh yeah  adjust these settings  adjust the brightness. Um how do we actually go about designing a new television remote control? First thing to do is to come up with the design specifications. We need to know what our final product is gonna be like  so we need a a clear idea of exactly what this product does  uh how it works  and what the end-user is gonna want from this product. Um. Oh  a way I'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing uh several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product  um and then uh trying to get some feedback uh about h how well these particular prototypes work  uh sorta find out what people think of 'em. Um using a remote control is is quite a subjective experience. Um  and different different people sort of prefer different things. Um we should remember that remote controls are a a fairly standard piece of equipment. When a users using a remote control  he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places. So in some sense we're gonna we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design uh so that we're not completely shocking people. But I think within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas uh and to make something that's that's perhaps a little bit different  something that stands out. Um also in in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities. Uh the first of these is is technological ye uh what can we do with the current state of technology as it is. The second is is economic  uh we need to find a balance between features and price. So as you mentioned things like voice recognition would would add to the price uh but it would also im improve the design of the product. So I had a look on the on the web uh to see if I could find a few examples of existing television remote controls. In analysing these we can consider what what things what's good about them  uh what things do they get right  what's bad about them  what's wrong with 'em  um how we can improve on the designs that that that I found and what can we do to make our product stand out from from the large majority of remote controls. Here's two examples uh probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum. Um on the left here we've got uh an engineering-based design for a remote control  so it's one that's got lots of buttons  it's it's fully featured  everything you might possibly want to do is there  you know  it's got forward  backwards  up  down  channel numbers  volume  uh freeze frame. Yeah  it's it's fully featured and it might take a while to get to learn to use it  but once you've learned it you can you can do whatever you want with your T_V_. The one on the right is a lot more basic. It's just got the essential functions of the T_V_ changing the channel  play  stop  volume. It would be a lot quicker to learn to use it  but again th it's it's swings and roundabouts. There are disadvantages  you can't use it say to to freeze the television picture. Uh there's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control. So we've got to to find our find a way of striking a balance between the two. Um as I said before  remote controls are subjective  different people want want different things. Um personally wa what I want from a remote control is a device that's simple  it it's easy to use  uh it's got big buttons for doing the things I do most often  changing the volume  changing the channel. It it does everything that I need it to uh  as I said before  I'm quite lazy  I don't wanna walk across the room just to adjust my television. I also want something that that looks cool  um and that that feels good  that's ergonomically designed. I think there's there's certainly a market for technology that looks cool. And I think that's that's why companies like Apple've 've 've made a lot of progress. Uh that was just on the d on the company web site  yeah. What's up? Lefty loosey. Uh. Never heard that before  that's good. I'll think of that every time now. You don't have it in the States? Oh  I didn't realise. Um yeah  it's like a I suppose it's kind of similar to a very very basic web browser. Um you have like you have uh numbers on your remote control  uh y and you type in the page number you want  so like you type a hundred on your remote control and this this kind of index appears on the television screen with just some some text and some very blocky looking graphics on it. And you just type numbers to go to different pages and it gives you information  mostly rather boring stuff like what's on T_V_ next and share prices and that kind of thing. Yep  news headlines. It's earl it's pretty old technology. It's like nineteen eighties. Right. So what's our corporate image like? It's It's kind of yellow colour with uh we put fashion in electronics. It's like double R_. Yeah. Is it is it something that's gonna be sold separately from the television or is it something that comes w with a television? 'Cause that would affect the way that we market it. Right. Right  okay. Yeah. Um. I I would say no  because it's gonna add too much to the price. Especially if we are marketing it as a separate product  people are gonna be paying uh  well  uh we've got a price limit of was it twelve twelve and a half Euros for to produce it? And I wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half Euros without having to make too many other compromises. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The remote There are remote controls like that  yeah. Like some T_V_s they have a sort of uh a sliding screen on the remote control of it that hides all the complicated buttons. So if you wanna do something complicated like programme your television or re-tune it  then you you open up this little hatch or or slide the screen down and there's all the all the special buttons. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's a good idea  yeah. Yeah. Si simplicity and fashion. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's  yeah  it's pretty it's pretty high-tech. It's for  like  the ultimately lazy people  who can't even be bothered to pick up the remote. Yep. I think the product appeals across a quite a broad range of ages. I mean  we we said simplicity is is one of the features  so it's going to appeal to people  maybe people who have problems with technology  you know  people who get scared by having lots of buttons  and that might be older people  but then we've also got fashion  which is something that definitely appeals to younger people. Yeah. Yeah aim for a an income group. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Which are kind of hidden away in some way or well not hidden but they're uh they're not as prominent as the main features. We should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all. I suspect the remote control does need a battery  but I dunno if you can Yeah. Yeah  without the energy  yeah. Yeah  that's that's possible. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Mm shall we go in the order that you just did it? I dunno. How do I hook my screen up? Where does it go? Mm-hmm. Hmm  I'm not supposed to move this  but Where's function? No signal. Ah  wait  's screw in. Push the screw. Mm alright I've never attached to anything. Alright  so  I don't know if you guys are able to get access to um the report that was online or if I'm the only one who is. But  I don't even know how to play this. No. Alright. So we're just gonna talk a little bit about the functional requirements that people specified when they were asked. Um I guess Real Reaction did some market research. They had a hundred subjects and their usability lab and they watched them watch T_V_ and recorded the frequency that they used particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had. What they found was they analysed people's desires and needs. Focusing on their desires  um people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly  seventy five per cent of the a hundred subjects noted that and that they more importantly though  eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote. I don't know anything beyond what fancy means  but that's particularly of use to us  I think. Um also they did some questions on voice recognition and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age  so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition  whereas the older people in the like sixty and above segment or so did not really think that they would pay more money for voice recognitions. Um people also had certain frustrations  that I think that we could try to take into consideration with our design. That being people k um frustrated with losing their remotes. I think  over fifty percent of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration. People are also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and I think that ties back to what you were saying before just that there's too many buttons  it just needs to be easy to use. It also mentioned something called R_S_I_ and I was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what R_S_I_ is  because I don't know. What? Ah. There we go. Wow. People do not like that. So I guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing  people do not like that  um the repetitive use  I guess  caused a strain. Um looking at the needs people specified  the problem right now is that people's remotes are not matching their operating behaviour. People are only using ten per cent of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote. And what people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume. People also zap like to change the channel  about um sixty five per cent during an hour of use. So we really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings  the screen settings and the channel settings  because they're used much more infrequently and probably just complicate what's going on. So I think that some things that we might wanna think about  the idea of an L_C_D_ screen was brought up although they didn't have any details on what people's preferences on that were  so I dunno know if that's coming to me later  or something like that. But something for us to consider also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote or what we wanna make easiest to use  make sure that  you know  something like an audio setting isn't given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that's used a lot more often. And basically in order for us to win over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like  that it has a fancy appeal and that it's not ugly and that it feels like the way they're gonna use it  so it doesn't give them any hand injuries or things like that. Hmm. Yeah  have I unscrewed it? Here we go. Mm-hmm. And I think that's in the shared  if I did it right  if anyone wants to look at it. No. A fashion fashion remote. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So wait  did it let you go on the Internet or was that just what it let you see? Okay. 'Cause I was like googling and then I'm like wait it won't let me google. Yeah  that's a good one it'll stick with you. What's teletext? Oh. Oh  so Mm-hmm. Oh. That explains a lot. That's good. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yes  I do think  who's gonna have the money to buy that also  that one? The only break-down that I was given in terms of age was the voice activation and basically there's a big jump  after thirty five people don't really care if it has voice  so it's like basically fifteen to thirty five that think that that's a good idea. I dunno I'm gonna be given any other numbers broken down in terms of age later  but if that's sort of the only quality that we have that is divided into age then we would wanna stick between the fifteen and thirty five range. But what else are we gonna put  I mean not that I'm really gung-ho about it  I don't know what else you can put in a remote to make it technologically advanced though. So like other than just making it look good  how is it I mean it can look really great and still have the same up-n-down buttons and why's anyone gonna buy a new remote? Mm-hmm. If someone's looking to buy a new remote  don't they want like an upgrade? I dunno. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Can you like I mean this may be too complicated  but  I wish I had something to explain it  like if it was just a simple  either this way or this way  that had like the main buttons and then you could like pull something out  kind of and like you got the rest the buttons  but the rest of them like went in. Do you know what I'm saying? Mm-hmm. 'Cause then 's like people who don't wanna ever look at them  never even have to see them and if you like get the instruction manual that comes with it and you just don't even read it then you'll never even know that those things can pull out. And you're a happy person and everyone else doesn't have to have like two remotes  one that has the easy ones and one that has more complicated ones  but 's all still in one. Yeah. I think simplicity  fashion. Mm-hmm. What can you do to like make the infra-red more functional  like why would it not be? I'm just wondering. Okay. So 's just the quality of the chip. Okay. Well  I dunno how useful that number is if we're not doing Yeah. Yeah. I don't. And if the whole idea is you're using a remote then why would you have voice  like you know what I mean and then it's like you wouldn't need a remote you'd just talk to your T_V_. Mm yeah. Maybe I mean if I get m more numbers  I'll e-mail you before the next meeting in terms of ages. But this doesn't divide up anything and there was only a hundred subjects also  which isn't  I mean  really isn't that representative  especially if it's a hundred subjects that th they then can subdivide into age groups that means there's very few in each age group  so Twenty to like fifty five. I dunno. Well maybe we don't have to defi define the target group by the demographic of age  maybe we can define it by like the demographic of like h t how much money they have to spend or something like that  like  well obviously it has to be someone who owns a television  and like how recently have they bought their television like that sort of thing. Yeah. H I mean  like I said before  fifty per cent of of the fru f like frustration someone can have that was the biggest one and half the people said that happened and we all mentioned it before we knew about it. And if we're talking about making something easy that sort of goes along with it so it wouldn't be like a random thing to sort of add in. It would be relevant to like the overall goal I think  so Hmm. on your coffee table  it's not like an eye sore  that kind of thing. Yeah. So you never have to change the battery. Mm. It's good. Did you um were you able to like put yours in the group folder? Okay. Yep. Where is that? Yours is I only have three  I just have like our three. Yeah. No  but that's 'cause I think yours is in the e-mail separate  like it's not on the server. But if I open it and then save it  probably will be there. Oh wait  never mind you can't save it to the Okay. Right. I think  you might have to disconnect Rose. Yeah. I I think you just have to push it in really hard. Oh  got it. Mm  neither have I. Alright. Hmm. 'Kay. Hmm. Hmm. Mm 'kay. Okay  great. Hmm. Yeah. I think that could be our selling point. Right. Hmm. Right  I really can't see what I'm doing  so does anyone have a Ah-ha  look at that  showing up already. Yeah. Alright um No  how do I play again? Ah. Okay. So this is our working design presentation. Um I had a bit of some issues with this  because I wasn't able to find everything I needed  but I guess that's we're still in early stages. Um so  yeah  this is this. Though th the thing about working design is the what we're trying to do as a working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function. Um one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder. It works because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans and then you put the bean through a filter and that filters out  and then you get coffee at the end that's nice and hot because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work. Don't know if I'm explaining that very well  but how do I get to the next s ah. So h the method as um working designers figure out what you need to make it fulfil this practical function  what what needs to be done and how do we convert all the elements to make that done. So wha the easiest thing to do is to break down all the points at which you need something to happen. So you make a schematic of the way that the the energy is converted tsh towards this practical function. And then I think the easiest thing to do is gonna be work on each task separately. So um Uh. Uh. So the findings that I got uh very just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infra-red is the best way to do that 'cause you don't need a sight line. So that's one thing we're gonna work on. Um the user interface is critical here  because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls that converts the electrical energy into data  which then goes through the infra-red  so the the chip that uh I think Ian is designing  is gonna be crucial. And really it all comes down to the to the user  because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design. So the components that we find here are the energy source  you know the battery or whatever that's gonna m make it work  then the chip  which converts the data  the user that's controlling the chip  and the infra-red bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver. So you have four main components and they are designed sort of like this. You have your energy source right there which then um brings uh energy or information to the chip  which is also controlled by the users. You have energy going to the user who's controlling the chip ooh 's not what I wanted to do uh uh. Previous. Sorry about that  guys. Oh. No  no  no  no  no. Okay  let's just get back to my schematic here. W yeah  yeah. I think it's frozen. Here. Don't show me that tip again. There we are. Sorry about this  guys. I'm kind of pathetic with things like this. Um alright. So you have your energy source  your user interface who's controlling the chip  the chip also uses the energy  and the chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work your infra-red bulb  which will then bring the data to the receiver. So hopefully that makes sense for everyone in my kind of garbled way. This is the the parts of the working design that need to be figured out. And personal preferences  besides the fact that I can't spell  we need a long-lasting energy source  people don't wanna be changing it a lot. We need a chip that works well with the user interface  that isn't too complicated. We need a straightforward interface  like Ian was saying  simple  not overwhelming it with information and we need a reliable and clear infra-red signal  so that you're not waving your remote around and having to get frustrated and go do it by hands. So that's pretty much it for the working design. Rose  do you think you can give me a hand with this? Yeah. Yeah. It's gonna stick in your head. Mm. Ooh  no signal. Okay. Uh  it's a British thing. No. S Lottery numbers and sport scores. But if you ever see the T_V_ saying like go to page one sixty on Ceefax now  that's what they're talking about. I have no idea why we don't have it  but 'Kay. Mm. Okay  so we want something that looks good and is yellow. Okay. Well if we're gonna say that function um fashion we put the fashion in in electronics then you automatically  I think  a sort of younger group that that's who's gonna be attracted to this. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah  that's probably uh a population w quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway  so that might be a fairly good target group for us. Mm. To produce it  yeah. Hmm. But right. Well but why are we why are we aiming for a technological advancement? Everything we're talking about is ease of use and simple and that doesn't necessarily mean more technology  in fact it could use it could mean  not. If they might be overwhelmed with with remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology. Yeah  simplification. They could have a crap remote that came with their T_V_ that's just impossible to use  or maybe it broke  or maybe they're just missing it. Hmm. Ooh. Ooh. Mm-hmm. Yeah  that's a good idea. Mm. Good point. Yeah. Yeah mm. The battery and that I think that the chip takes the data and presents it well  without sort of scattering. Yeah. I think so. The quality uh quality of all the components really  I mean  we can't really do anything shoddy work  'cause it's gonna be visible down the line. Mm-mm. Yeah. Ooh. Yeah. I Mm-hmm. Yeah  but I th I think regardless we're we're aiming for the under sixty five or something. Or like single professionals or something. Yeah. It's really hard to figure out right now. Yeah. That's a good point. Yeah. Mm. Yeah  t probably. Mm. Mm. Yeah  that'll probably be good. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Alright. Battery battery use. Yeah  but I think that goes in with simplicity and ease of use really. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. It I think it does. I don't I don't think of a way you can operate a chip and convert that much data without without one. But you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone  or like a little cradle for your iPod. You could we could maybe do that instead. So you don't ha you got like a rechargeable battery. I dunno  that might contribute to less people losing it too if it it stays in one place. Mm. Yeah. That's just off the top of my head. Yeah  who knows. Okay Sounds good. Yes  I just did that. Hopefully it is there for people. Yeah? Yeah. Okay. Technical. So in there we have technical functions presentation  working design presentation and the functional requirements. At least that's what I have in. Yeah  that's what I have as well  R Rose So. Yeah. Okay. ,The project manager opened the meeting and went over the minutes of the previous meeting. The marketing expert discussed user preferences in terms of remote controls and the increasing interest among younger consumers in speech recognition. The marketing expert also discussed a user target group for the remote and addressed the issue of whether the target group would result in sufficient sales of the remote. The user interface designer presented two existing remote controls on the market  which the team later evaluated  and discussed what features in terms of appearance and functionality the remote the team is creating should include. The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and addressed the issue of what happens when remotes no longer operate. The team also discussed options for energy sources  such as solar power and rechargeable internal batteries. Th team then discussed their user target group  marketing ideas such as selling the remote to television manufacturers  and what functions the remote would feature. 
Welcome back. Uh let me see. Okay. Roo  welcome back. The waiting is for Sebastian. There he is. Sorry? Uh no. You can't  sorry. Well  this is life. Sorry uh  Roo. Okay. Okay. People  welcome back with the second meeting. Um for now on the schedule are a few points. Uh first of all the opening  which we are doing now. Um second  I received um some new project requirements. I'm not sure if you received them as well  um but I will tell you about it. Um then um the three of you uh prepared a presentation  I think? Sebastian? Roo? Ruud? Almost  okay. Then we'll do your one uh uh as la uh the last. Um the top goal of this m Um we will figure that out. Ca can you try to Yeah  w we will see. Um it is  yeah. Yeah. Um the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product  on the target group um and and the functions of the remote control  so keep that in mind. Um we have forty minutes. So it's now Yep. Okay. Um the new project requirements  first of all  um we didn't speak about it  but we should not um support teletext in the remote  um because our b um board uh feels that uh teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext. So um we are not even going to try to um implement it in our product. It's a board decision. Um the remote control should only be used for television  because it's not uh f uh feasible  it's not uh w uh uh we we cannot make it because of the time to market um that we have to deal with. Uh the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than uh forty  which is important for you  uh Ruud  and as well for uh Roo. Because the product should um be uh interesting and and uh should be bought by people younger than forty. Um then for Roo  as well uh important  the corporate image should be recognisable in our product. So the colour colours and the slogan um do have to be uh in the product. Is that clear? Any questions on these requirements? No? Okay. Um the individual presentations  I th um Roo or Sebastian  who of you would like to start? Uh uh yeah. Okay  great. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Uh-huh. Okay. Uh Ruud  did you get that? Okay  so the important thing here is In the market  yeah. Yeah  okay  w we will s we all uh Yeah. Okay. Sebastian. No  it's not visible. Yeah. Okay. So it's fairly easy. Okay. Okay  good. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah  but but the question is whether um two or four buttons makes uh m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to uh include fancy lightning techniques  I guess. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay  Ruud. Okay well  we ar we are very curio curious to what the market um will feel about such a product. So any income is welcome. Input. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Well  that's interesting. Yeah  that's definitely interesting. It uh it separates our product from others uh as well. Okay  go on. Okay. So that's what the market tells us. Yep. Okay. Yep. Well maybe maybe like clapping in your hands  like um turning on and off the the the lights. Reports rep respend response to it. But uh th Yeah  because we do not have a a a a a home um Okay. So what about the clapping technique? Um because you se Well  you see it a lot in in light uh lightning uh uh Yeah  a peak. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  that's true. Well uh Yeah. Yeah  m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function  if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things. Um maybe Sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution  because that's his his field of expertise. Mm-hmm. Yep. Yeah  it's a distinction in the market. It's a different exactly. It's an uni an unique feature  and um I think um it's worth um uh looking and and probably more i interesting than uh than the lights. Yeah. Yeah. Well  um according to Ruud  um people do not use um all the extra features very very often. So Okay. Okay. Well  we we do have a wise board  so I'm not questioning that. Yeah. Okay  so on the relevance scale uh the channel selection  the volume selection and the teletext. Well  we skip that. Okay. No. Yeah. Uh uh uh I think we should go for the easier one. No. Yeah. Okay  Ruud  how do you feel about that? Uh do you agree  do you think the market would would respond to uh a simple Mm-hmm. Mm yeah. Okay  so this is is kind of uh Yeah. But but are we not in in the in the manual uh I mean if you have few buttons  no display  um I mean uh I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and um one button can uh But but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is? Because we do not implement uh a user history. I know  but but if we use uh like a stick  for example  um Yeah. Uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions. Yeah  draw draw it on the board. Yeah  it can break down. Uh-huh. Okay  yeah. Okay  but w we still we're still in the question of uh um uh putting in advanced options. Um Ruud just told us um the market is interested in some advanced uh new techniques. Um however  uh keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things. We need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user-friendliness. Um well  for we do have to uh decide this this meeting. Yeah. We need to um have the uh the user function uh the functions decided and um uh our target audience. Um well  I do not want a full uh it's not necessary to to have a full list  but I want um the kind of functions  for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting. Well  for example  that that's what we should think about. l how is the remote going to look? Not not in the user interface  but Yeah. A bit of a split mode. Uh l like Yeah. Dual channel watch. Okay  well um m maybe I should write that down. Uh Ruud  um what's your last name? Mielsen  because I I was writing it down in the last uh Mielsen. Right. Um I put all the minutes I make into the shared folder. So if you want to have a look at it  you know where to find it. Um Yeah  that's that's if you want to do it  Sebastian. Okay  um Okay  so so um uh Volume. Programme. Uh dual channel. Uh And and do we want um the ten digits? Yeah. I agree actually. But we do have thirteen different Dutch channels. Often. Well  it depends on the on the on the looks  on the on the You c you can d make them very fancy by um I mean Nokia  they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy. So I'm I'm I do not agree Uh Exactly  exactly. Okay  speech. Yeah. To find yeah. Uh If if we would um drop the ten digits but keep the programme and the volume  because maybe people do not always want to use their voice  um Yeah. But we do focus on younger people. We d it it's a board uh decision. Okay. Okay. Okay  g good. Okay. Mm. Yep. Okay. But But but can we manage it bu uh for the costs? Because it seems like a very Is a cradle very cheap? I know  b uh but there should be an adapter as well. Okay. Okay. We we have uh about ten minutes left this meeting. Um I would like to hear um maybe maybe you all have th uh things not um spoken about  yeah  but that are important. Uh Ruud  you you came up with the voice recognition uh data. Uh are there other things about the market we should know? Okay. Okay. Okay  so although we are focussing on younger people uh to make it uh profitable uh Profitable. We we yeah  we still need to take in account the the bit older people. Okay. O okay. Um Roo. Nothing to add. Sebastian? Yeah? Great. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yep. Yeah  and that was the main issue  right? The the board Yeah. The board. No  it's th yeah. It's the other way around  yeah. It shouldn't be a big issue. Okay. I'm not sure how how we'll f uh determine the costs  I will have a look at it. Maybe you will get some information on that. Um I'm not sure how how that Yep. Okay  great. Um well  I think we're qui quite done. Um for now we will have the lunch break. Um I'm don't know how long the break will be  but we'll find out. Um then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work  uh and I'm sure your personal coaches will uh assist you with it. Um I will put the minutes I just made in the project documents folder. If you want to look at it um well  just do. Um the Interface Designer  um I would like to the next meeting I would like to receive the uh components concept. Uh Roo  um from you I would like to see Uh I'm sorry  yeah  I'm sorry. User Interface Designer  uh Roo  I would like to see the user interface c uh concept. And um Well  i it should be easy  that's w w what we concluded. It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons. S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one. And um um yeah  some some fancy lights. I think that's what we decided. No no no  we didn't but it shouldn't be integrated yeah  it's of course it's user interface  but um i I was talking about really the design of the No. We can decide the next meeting. Yep. Yeah. I guess all of you have i updated info. I'm sure the marketing expert will receive uh t uh you will do some trend watching. And I'm sure the market will um uh uh will change  adapt and um so we will see that. Um yeah  that's it for now. Any other questions or can we have the lunch? Yeah  okay. Good. Hello. There's one of mine. Hello  Flores.. We have a slight problem. I opened uh the C_D_ ROM box uh guys. So just cancel it. Yeah  I opened the C_D_ ROM box. Accidentally. But it's alright. Mm-hmm. Yeah. But you can't upload your presentation from here  I believe. Okay. I don't think it's wireless here. Or it is. Yeah? Okay  great. Yeah. Time  yeah. Yes. Yeah  I'll start. Um Oh  how can I uh Geez  and sli and show. Um Just uh press it. Uh yes. Alright. Um well w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion. Uh the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set. So that was the main uh important thing what a remote control should do. Then I found uh two different kind of remote controls  the multi-function uh remote control with many possibilities  but um the lack of the feeling I already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion. And the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons. Um but um yeah. My personal preferences were ease of uh the easy to use remote control  because uh the user-friendliness and uh it can be more trendy in in user design. But um your new goal f was for uh people than less than forty years old. So maybe um the multi-function can be implemented in uh in our design. But it should b I think it should be a combination  but teletext buttons are not uh in our design. So it should uh take out  well  eight buttons or so. But my in my opinion  the the easy to use R_C_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us. Yeah. And it's also i indeed uh uh Ruud's uh insight in the in the topic. Yeah  what what does the market want? I I don't know. Just for uh for user desi uh user uh friendliness I uh should choose for the the ease of use remote control. Scusi. Energies and uh Yeah. The glow in the dark uh concept uh we discussed. Succeed in it also. And what's the um if we use the LEDs  i does it use much more energy or Okay. For the same costs  it's can be uh in our Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's uh Yeah. But I think Yeah  I think it's the same as in the cell phone  just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons  and not for Yeah  but not for each button one LED  I think. Could you step a little bit more to the right? Yeah  thank you. Yeah. Sound signal. Yeah. The volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used. So Yeah  well it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons. And first um Yeah. Yeah  the sound signal. Just one thing I'm just wondering  the sound signal  from where do you execute th the s sound? Another device is not a solution. It should be uh uh Yeah  but maybe you'll uh get some new technologies for it. Yeah  just like uh the phones the But but T_V_s don't have all uh uh buttons. Uh But I believe you will have an I'm convinced uh Sebastian will uh find uh one solution for us. But we can have just uh uh a home stat uh f a base station next to the T_V_. Just a little antenna or uh something. Well if you lost th I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote. Uh that's just uh just a base station next to the T_V_ is the best possibility. Yeah. And do we even uh prefer the sound above the the LEDs  the lightning uh function? It's a unique item uh It will be an a unique feature of our remote control. Yeah. And just about uh the user interface  I came up with um an easy remote control and an advanced remote control. What should we choose in in design? Well  the extra functions. Used option. Well  so it just th the basic functions. And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players uh and all kind of stuff. So Yeah. Just through uh the easy uh design. We can make uh a nice design when when there's not mu uh much buttons in it. So Uh just a few buttons  trendy design  nice lightning effects wh and the sound. Yeah  I don't know yet. But does it uh I then should n just use uh i instead of the stick  uh like many cell phones  just a round m well  should we just use a Um it's already uh oh  we have a blank. Oh. It's just an easy uh way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions. Instead of a stick. A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down or uh just a round uh button should be the trick  I think. Yeah. Geez. Well  volume and something uh like that. The programme up and down. And the vol yeah  the pen doesn't uh really does what I want. But I think our our next step to look at is just that. So I don't think it's um we have something to do. Uh we can't discuss it right now  because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that  I think. Yes? Mm-hmm. 'Kay  but teletext is so uh is just scrapped. The ten digits. Oh  and just one function. The the the the programme to programme button  the switch to uh two channels  when you have uh something on channel four and something on channel six  just one button which which can uh change yeah. Yeah. Alright. Our B_S_C_ uh W_ uh The ten digits? Yeah  I believe so. Yeah. I wouldn't buy it personally. A remote control without the ten digits. Uh and I think the most Just elder elder people would would buy it  but Yep. The older people only use five of them. Yeah. On the design. Yeah. Yeah. So we have to i to make um a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition. Mm-hmm. Twelve dollar fifty. I have nothing uh nothing to add  I think. But the cheaper the ch uh the the chip or th what was it? The circuit board. The fewer buttons you can use on it. Yeah  okay. Yeah. Well it then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh especially for the voice recognition. No. We're done  I think. Me neither. Interface industrial. Yeah. Uh the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis uh decisions Sebastian makes. About the voice recognition. Well Yeah. Yep. Adapt. That's it. 'Kay. I'll take the lunch. Is there any time for a cup of coffee? Can I get a cup of coffee? Okay. Well  during my work I have no time either. So I think so too. It is. It is. Yes. Okay. Excuse me. Um Okay  it's still the right thing. Okay. Um well  there are some changes in the design requirements  so there are some changes in the method also. Um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set. And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set. Well  I th I tried to uh implement a picture here  but it's hardly readable. Can you see it? No? Well Um  there's a energy source here. And um basically there it's connected to three things. The user interface connected to a chip  which is connected to the sender  which generates messages using uh infrared light  which are sent to the receiver. That's basically the idea. And there's a little picture  just for your imagination  how a device like this should look or can look. Okay. Um what have I found. Usually these kind of things consist of a battery  infrared diode  buttons  chips  and circuit board. That's all. It's cased together  nothing more than that. It's almost every piece of equipment um every piece of uh every T_V_ set is controlled infrared. There are some exceptions  but most of all have uh infrared controls. And uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons. And I think that's what we w yes. In the and it's a little more a little bit more fancy also. So maybe we should consider that. Okay. I have a basic scheme of the things uh which are implemented. Um basically this is all there is. There's just one chip. There are a few buttons connected. Uh the buttons are lit. And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode  and there is not a power source here. So that's basically the total design of this piece of equipment. There's nothing more to it. It's fairly easy. It's been done many times before  and I think we should uh we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this. So Okay  so uh personally I think we should infra use infrared  because uh otherwise our device cannot uh communicate with uh almost every T_V_ set. So I think that uh should be clear. Uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse  friendly components. Uh there are specially uh designed um energy-friendly components which consume uh far less power than uh conventional components. And um if we want to use uh a rechargeable design or uh a energy-save design  we should really implement them. Um for cost-effectiveness  we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board  um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment. And um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques  blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff. I think our uh users will really uh will really like that. No  they're p f uh power friendly LEDs also. So we can use them. So that's no problem. Uh no  they're uh they're a little bit more expensive  but by uh um um making We can we can make its I think. Okay. Hmm. Yes. Well  it's not one light  it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device. No no no  no. That's right  that's right. So well  this uh should be it. Um have a think about it. Mm. Or a find a finding function  you know. That's quite a yes. Yes. Yes. Yes  we should focus on that  I guess. Well  the technical uh there I think there are no technical difficulties. There's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment. So um I don't think we have any hiccups there. So we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs. So maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal. Well Yes. Th that's a bit of that's a problem. Usually Oh yes. Yes. Well  there there are some devices who uh incorporate this technique already. Um there are video sets and um they have a special button  the find the remote control button. You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a uh kind of weird sound  and your uh remote controls then start to beep. And um Yes. Yes  that's it. Yes  same thing. No  so we we should use something else. We do not control the T_V_ set so well. Yes  m yes. S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers  so we should think about It's quite complicated. Well  it's quite complicated. Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds. Yes  yes. Well  basically the characteristics uh the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume  the amplitude of the sound  which is uh generated a few times within a uh certain period of time. But there are many other sounds uh which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control. Yes  so we don't want that. Maybe we can Something like that. Well  is there not something f something more easily Well  I don't think uh. No  and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh. And then uh the remote control uh reports itself  so w we should use have uh we should use something like that. You do not want another device  which can be uh everywhere in the house  which you have to find first before you can find your remote control. Yes  something like that. But that will be very costly  I think. So that's not a good idea. Mm-hmm. I will. Yes. Yes. But um before I do that I w I want to warn you that uh by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated um and it will become more costly also. Because there will be additional components which which uh will be used. And there are some implepe imp Well  I I think so  because um when you have a p newspaper over your remote control  you cannot see it. So Okay. No  no. So that's out of the question. So I think also. Yes. Well  we should save costs uh by not implementing a lot of functions and uh the money that we can save from that we should use for uh having a nice design and uh thinking about the user interface and Yeah  that's right. Mm. Okay. Well  is it maybe there's another possibility. You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment  but it's quite elaborated  uh because it has many functions. Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very uh friendly  easy to catch piece of equipment  but um nevertheless Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Ok like that. Well  I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling  by by these kinds of sticks or something like that. I don't know if if it's user-friendly. That's your field of expertise. Mm-hmm. There's no  but there's no way to do that  because we cannot implement that kind of the system. W Mm-hmm. Well  maybe we can use a light for that. When you move the stick to a to a position  maybe uh a light next to it can lit up. So you know I've just uh pushed the button  or I changed the channel or t uh turned up the volume. Something like that. Yes. Oh yeah  something like that. It's not really a stick  but Yes. Yes. Hmm. Yes  yes. And Yes  and this also looks more fancy  I think. I think it it will attract uh more uh uh public  I think. But you're the marketing man. Okay  that's good. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Do do you want a list of functions? Do you want an explicit list? Uh which uh incorporates all function available on the device? Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yes. Change. Yes  yes. Yes. Well you're the secretary. Mm okay  but make a s make a sub-folder for it  because it's starting to fill up already. Sure.. Yes  that's important. Well  are are you sure? I'm not so sure. Well  that's complicated  but is that so relevant? Because I don't think but you should uh shou you should know that. If it were so. Okay  I can imagine when I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have  well  about six hundred channels  I can imagine you want this. But if you're uh a regular T_V_ user  and you just want uh to watch the the Dutch television networks  well  you can uh you can use uh about ten buttons. That's enough. Well  but how how often do you watch all these channels? No  you're probably right. Okay. But I think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull. Don't you think? The design. Okay. Well  y then there should be should done be done something specific with it. Mm-hmm. Okay  so you can experiment by uh with with shape or with size or with colour  that kind of thing. Okay. Well  maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control. So um when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control  uh it's very easy to change uh the channel. That's one thing. And it's very easy uh to find your remote control. So maybe that's a possibility  but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly. But maybe when we uh Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay  okay. Okay. Well. I I think it should uh should work  it sh we should manage that. Yes. Well  the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage. It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find uh find the remote control button uh remote control function. So that's that's a big advantage  I think. There's only one disadvantage uh by implementing this. Um the power saving power saving will be a bit more difficult. So we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries. But maybe can we we can think something smart about it. There are some uh hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries. So when you just leave the device in a in a light room  it charges itself. You have to do nothing for it. Maybe  maybe not. I'll have to find that out. Yes. So No  that's very cheap. It's Oh  it's very cheap. That's no problem. It's just a a case with two uh metal contacts. It's Yes  but they're they're mass production. They're very cheap. So it will cost us p practically nothing. Yeah. Profitable. Um I just want to make a summary of all all things uh spoken and uh the different possibilities. Um so uh basically we've decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design. So on the outside it looks easy  but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside. So that's one the those are the choices we have to make. But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by uh implementing uh speech techniques  uh voice recognition  that these kinds of things. Um it makes it also more uh attractable  I think  to our uh audience. Um there are some advantages and some disadvantages  and the main advantage is that we can implement uh fancy techniques  which uh I think our customers will like. The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about uh the the costs and um the things like uh battery lifetime  energy saving. Uh another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons. If we just add uh uh a chip which does the voice recognition  uh our circuit board will become even more cheap. So that's another well  it wa it w it was an issue  but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible. And this even uh makes it more cheapy. So Mm-hmm. The circuit board. The fewer buttons you have  the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board  yes. And it's very cheap uh to incorporate uh uh an integrated circuit  a chip. So that's that's another advantage. So Yes  because I don't know Yes. I d I really don't know. So It can be costly. Maybe not. Yes. Yes  I al I I hope my personal coach will uh have a lo uh look at it. How nice. Well  we understand. Well Mm yes. So we drop the voice recognition? Or Oh. Okay. Well um do we really have to decide now or can we decide next meeting? Okay. Because I'll have some updated info on that uh Adapt. We can have the lunch. Hello. Almost. Uh if it if it if it's wireless I could just uh put it in the. Uh okay. Yeah  uh b uh most. Oh  user-friendly. Well you could only lit uh the buttons the buttons that are used most. So  the channel switching. Or Hmm  true. Oh  mine is already outdated. Since uh Okay  make Well Uh then I'm sure the target market is uh ten million units. Of of which we should sell about uh forty percent to make the five million. But um since uh the other part is uh forty percent of the market  I uh thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market. But uh since uh the requirements changed  that's uh not a good idea. Uh well  skip this. Well  it's this till true  of course. That they only use ten percent the buttons. The buttons to zap are used the about uh fifteen hundred times  when uh the power button is only used one time. And the volume button's only four times. So they're obv obviously uh the most important buttons. And uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control. So we might want to build in a feature to uh support them. Some uh audio signal. Like uh home phones. Or Yeah. Well  I just said that. And uh well  this obvious  and he also said it. Uh that's about it  yes. Uh mo uh zap buttons most. Volume  they are uh use a lot. But more than all the other buttons. So Yeah  that's uh a problem. Yeah. Yeah. And you Yeah  and usually And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button  uh you would have to walk to your T_V_  and it's And b So if if you'd be watching a movie  it would constantly beep. Yeah. Yeah. I have the numbers r I have the numbers right here. Well  t uh we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function. Uh well yeah  channel selection is obviously the most important. So Yeah. Yeah. So Nope. Uh well if we um include other uh innovative functions uh then they uh might  'cause young people uh like new features. So And if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection  you have the m two most important functions in one uh button. Yeah. A younger uh Huh. And it's also quite easy to use  so it'll it uh attract younger people because well new  and it might attract older people because it's easy to use. Mielsen. Yeah. Well  if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button. Well But Yeah  and if if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience  they will probably watch more channels than the older people. So Well And And um there are some numbers about uh speech recognition here that uh younger people would like it. Uh it might be expensive and uh hard to implement  but it would be a solution uh for Yeah. Especially elder people uh don't like voice recognition. So then we should implement such a but Yes. M And uh if we if we could inc uh include a c a cradle in which it could recharge  then there wouldn't be uh a big problem. 'Cause when Yeah. Um I think we dealt with the most important information. Just that the younger part of uh the market isn't the forty percent we uh want to sell to. So we we should uh for least a bit uh look at the uh older people. But with uh buttons like that  which are easy to use  we uh might attract them too. So I don't think that's a big problem Yes. Yeah  profitable. Yes. Hmm. Left. Hmm. Yeah. ,The meeting begins and the marketing expert starts her presentation promptly  telling them that her research shows they need a focus- it is not possible to make a device that works on the whole house. The project manager steps in and informs them that they have instructions to eliminate the teletext idea because it is too complicated  and also said they must maintain the corporate image by using corporate designs and colors. The marketing expert resumes  talking about how remotes often get lost and that a light emitter might be useful. The industrial designer gives her presentation  talking about components  materials  and energy sources. They discuss giving the control different shapes to suit both adults and children  making the buttons various shapes  and putting a display clock on the control. The interface designer presents  talking about the features users like on a remote and suggesting that they make the remote a T-shape and add an alarm clock function. They discuss their target group and the possibility of removable plastic cases. They close the meeting deciding to do more research on the plastic cases. 
Your judgement it's is biased. So  we are So let's go for our detailed design meeting. So I will still play the role of the secretary  and we'll have um first the project presentation by our User Interface Designer  David Jordan  and our Industrial Designer  Baba. So we'll have to evaluate the uh your proposed remote control  and um have an idea of the price that uh this thing will cost. And in case if we're we all agree on the fabrica of um building of this remote control  we'll evaluate the um production. So maybe I will let the our two designers talk about so their You have s oh  sorry. Oops. Looks strange. Okay. Genetically modified mushroom I will say  but keep on speaking. Oh. Maybe  I hope so. Chan Yeah  okay  but don't touch don't destroy your prototype. Everything's mushroom. So we can call our remote control the mushroom. Okay. Oh. Fruits and vegetables. Vegetables. Mushroom is a vegetable. It's vegetable. So th it's something eatable. Next slide. Mm-hmm. In the base. In the basement. In the basement. And where is the solar solar cell? Where is the solar cell? Oh. Do you think it won't be It won't cris increase the price? Okay  we'll see after. We will have first to so  mister money  what's your opinion according to this remote control? Mm-hmm. Maybe if you change if you take the buttons out  and maybe do things like that It would be bet more like a lemon? Yeah. Looks like more fruit. Maybe a pineapple? And you know  you have the finger here  with the buttons? It looks more like a pineapple. Sorry. What's the use for that? And where is the voice recognition? Okay. Okay. Is it better like that? Looks okay  let's say it's a pineapple now. It looks like a now you took it. It looks like a pineapple with cherry on top. Mm uh Seven is the ma the maximum? Three  I will say three. Isn't it bitter like that? Feasible? You said previously that you there's um microphone inside an Oh. Okay  and you have the there's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments? And you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative? We have tactile buttons. Oh  yeah. Maybe two? Two? I would say two. You agree? It's better like that  isn't it? Okay. Oh  ok I understand. You take take the remote  so and you can turn like that to change the channel? I think it's quite easy to so s zapping  but maybe it will be too fast. Yeah  you have a  like that  and so on. Oh yeah. Yeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go Mm-hmm. Yeah  but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other  so you're passing through all the channels. So  when you say I want to go to the channel number twenty that's you've decided to go to channel twenty  so you can say channel twenty  or channel four  because you really want to go on this channel. But if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really know what you want to do  you can turn it. Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting? Seems to be good. Good choice  mister David Jordan. yeah  what's what's this cherry? Okay. Yeah  th you have the vocal commands. On off. Most of the time you have the yeah it's a sleeping remote control. That's true. W that why we have the solar ti yeah. So three. Do you agree? Three? And what's your opinion? It's not what you said previously. Previously you said that turning this was the fine Fine to coarse. And from ten to ten channels here. Okay. Oh Yeah  no no  no. You can't put it out. It's just your turning from the base. You need to have everything in hand. If you want to turn  you can't use it and turn. It's impossible. You need to put it on and turn. Yeah  but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say I've lost the remote control. Nobody would take it. So nobody w will lost lose it. S maybe we can change from th Four? Easy to use  four. Gonna say four. Trois. Three. So  th the project is accepted? But I d m I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple. If you re we really want to have a fruitful remote control. So uh mm mm. Mm. Okay and we we had a project prototype presentation with the evaluation. So as we all agree to accept  under certain conditions  the prototype  we'll have look to the final sh financial view. So we need to calculate the production cost. As I said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty Euros. And if not if it's not the case y you would have to redesign it. So  just have a look at the okay here is the Excel sheet  so so it has the energy source. We have hand dynamo. No  we don't use that. We have battery  right? Kinetic  we don't have it  I suppose  but we have solar cells. Um  how many do y do you need  solar cells? Do you think one would be enough  or such as as number of branches? Three? So  electronic. Single simple chip on print? Just one would be necessary? One? Zero for the others. And sample sensor  sample speaker. One? As we have voice recognition  I think. So the case. Okay  just keep on going  just to have an idea. Well uh yeah  but what what about case? Uncurved  flat  single curved  double curved. I think it's more like double curved. One? Uh wood? Uh do we need special colour? Y maybe  two? We have two special colours. Push button. Okay. Scroll wheel. We don no. It it's more like integrated scor. Yeah  maybe two scroll wheel  as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel. So  no button supplements? Okay. Okay we I think we have problem. I think we s if we keep on adding things so we have to Maybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one? Has it changed. Okay. Yeah  but we have you the the voice recognition  no? Okay. Or it would be better. So  do we need special colour? Because we have red. Red and yellow. I think so we need if we try to have a kind of pineapple bee. Yeah. An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button. And I think this is one. Integrated scroll wheel push button. So we'll we have only one? And push button. So if we have all integrated i in the scroll wheel and push button  it's uh Something flat. S uncurved. Yeah  maybe not. Yeah. Mm. Nearly. Maybe don't bat no battery  only solar cells. I think there's a problem with the push push button. We only need maybe just one. Just one. Yeah. So yeah  you will have So one button  and s scroll wheel with push button on it. So So  yeah. It think we we've done good job  as the cost is twelve fifty e Yeah  but it's under or equal. It's not written. Sometimes it's under or equal. Twelve fifty. Yeah  I think. I think  yeah. But it would i be interesting for our marketing team  to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be Yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative  so. So it's easy to use and powerful  as the remote control a has only one button. Easy  powerful. So I don't think we need to redesign the p the product. Yeah. So Now So So did you enjoy your clay modelling? Yeah? Was it a nice way to create your remote control? And for the marketing guy? And new ideas about new products  maybe  wi which would be fashion and uh and yellow. Yes  just lemon. Squared? Ah  the lemon T_V_ with the pineapple remote control. Oh  that's interesting. You could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things. Electronic device. Maybe Yeah  maybe la next year it will be insects. Customable T_V_. Ah such yeah. You've already said mobile phones. Yeah  and following Mm. It's interesting  maybe we can create a a line of uh T_V_ with uh a a tr So I think the costs are within the budget. We're just at twelve fifty Euros. So do you think you can celebrate your creation? Oh  thanks a lot. Thank you  mister David Jordan. The thing now is to to sell it. It's maybe a little bit expensive. Maybe what you can do a test. Put it outside  and if bees come  it's really fruit. But don't put sugar in it  it's not working. Yeah  but the colour  I think the colour is more is most important  because I I don't think you have ever seen something like that before for a remote control. Yeah  but we decided to have something yellow and red  for the costs. So maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side  the double R_. So we have the logo  we have the colour  and we have the fashion in electronics  so we have the slogan too. Yeah th no  it's the it's the pineapple control remote control. It's a pineapple now  it has changed. It's a pineapple. Pineapple. With cherry on top. Will you buy one? Try to. Okay uh One thing I like is the shape  because you know it's not like the uh the remote controls you can put in your pocket  on uh in your jacket. I prefer the laser remote control. No. Oh. Maybe next if we decide to do something we'd can put light inside. Yeah. I think it it would be interesting to just to see if we can if people will buy this one  and maybe add some features to it after yeah. So Champagne  mister Baba. So Okay  I will close this. Mm. So I think we have finished the designing and the evaluation of our remote control and we have a nearly final product. Final prototype  right. So  thank you very much. Very productive. 'Kay. It's perfect. Where? It's here. Okay. Yeah. 'Kay. I have slides. Ah  that is three. Product prod Yep. Okay. Okay. So  this is our product or prototype. This is made by clay. Yeah. Uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red. Yellow is uh our company colour  uh red it's uh is more attractive. So we used two basic colour  yellow and red. And the shape  there's two basic shape. The first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece. It's we call it a mushroom design. It's looks like some mushroom  so we call it mushroom design. So this is a introduction of our product. Next a mo Okay  yeah  so next slide. So there are several key features of our pr prototype. The first is that it is fuzzy. I'm sure this would be the unique design the market. Yeah  so it's a fuzzy design  and a unique design. Um  and uh the second key feature is that uh s circle channel um selection. In the traditional key uh traditional controller use button to to select the channel but now we have a s circle  so we can turn this ball to t to select channel. So it's quite convenient for user to use it. Yeah  s okay. Uh the third feature is a stable triangle base. Uh this sta uh this triangle base is very stable  so uh so it's it's um it's unlikely you cannot found it. So it's v Um  you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel and there's some cute button. You c can can you can see the the shape of the buttons n is a mushroom  so Yeah  everything's mushroom. Mush Mushroom design  yeah. Yeah. Yeah  th that's why if you put it in the table  be careful  somebody will eat it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh  no this our only two slides. Yeah. So we cut it to see. Okay. So where's the battery battery? Base. Here? Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah  I think so. Yeah  the shape is unique  and the colour So it depend on how d do you define fancy. Uh so  my mush. Mm. Yeah. Hmm. Uh  for turn turn the ball. If you want to turn the ball  it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel. Uh. Ah  it's embedded  your microphone. Th this th th there's two two functions. This is microphone array Okay. 'Kay. Yeah yeah yeah. Yeah  this is microphone array  in fact. There four microphone. So they they they they there's a microphone array. Yeah  yeah. So you can capture voice yeah  you c Yeah  so you can capture s voice from different directions. Yeah. Yeah  I agree. Yeah  it's very easy. You can use this in this way. Yeah. Th this is the base. So you can turn to change the channel. You just tu turn d d Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No  no  no. I if y uh if it depend on the the angle you turn the I if if this is a channel one. So it c it could be channel two  channel three  channel four  channel five. So change. Yeah. Y uh fifth channel divided by the num by the by three hundred thirteen degree. So you got how many degree you you it No no  you don't have to y no it's uh when you when you stop t uh when you stop  the the turn  then the angle you stop is the angle you is the channel you It's it's very easy  because you kn you know how many channel are there in the Yeah  yeah  yeah. You can do it. I think so I think so you can do it. I think so  you can just change. There's uh also a number  you know. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And also you can  if you i You ca you can turn this. Or you ca you can you can also turn this. For this you can tune it's for tune. You you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two  you you skip this. If you want to from uh skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this. It's like fine  from coarse to fine. This is coarse  this is fine. So it's coarse to fine design. Yeah. Yeah is is this is  from one channel to maybe to ten channel. This is from one channel to Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah  agree  agree. Uh w w what do y what uh you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller? I think it's easier than traditional controller. If you use traditional controller you have to put a button  but now you don't have to put button  you have you just turn the turn the ball. There's two kind of balls  the smaller the the the so you can c you can c you can control the scale. But in the traditional controller  how do how can you control the scale? Yeah  yeah  yeah  y you you can do it  but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here. Yeah  this function is just for your browsing  from one channel to th the next one  the next s sn s  the th the third one. Yeah  yeah. Y one to ten  ten to twelve  uh ten to t uh twenty. Ten to twenty and this one  t one two three four five six  like this. Uh there's different scale  so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc Mm-hmm. I i this is just a base. You can just Yeah. You use your y So th this is a d next generation controller. Yeah. Okay okay  okay. Four. Okay. Okay. Three? Trois. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Mm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. The solar cell is too expensive. Mm. Yeah  we have four. Five. No. No no. No no no  it Okay. No. We have change the electronics to from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip. Oh. We have to delete the the sample sensor  I think. Yeah it's the one it's m maybe we ha we have two versions  the first version  the basic version. Advanced version we have speak. Plastic is free. Wait. We we can we can we c yellow. How about we change the sale? Ah we have one Okay. Okay. Agree. Cou could we have look Could we have look at the p the the prod the p the cost? Okay. So let's say Wha what yeah. Which part is the most expensive part? Yeah  I think it's not t t Cheaper. Okay. Yes. Of course. This is my job. Yeah  it's uh it's good  to to create a control instead of a computer. Yeah. Okay. Yeah  but y you know the traditional T_V_ it's um Yeah yeah it's flat  yeah the shape is very boring. Could we come up with new T_V_ with such as this kind of T_V_? So you can you have base  triangle base so you the T_V_ you can Yeah. Yeah. Because the T_V_ you also Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. And you can celebrate your leadership. Yeah. Yeah  it's your job. Sell it. Yeah. Okay and the twelve fifty twelve uh twelve Twenty five Euros  yeah. Twenty five Euros. No  it's not so expensive. Okay. Okay. Mm. So we have to give a So we have give him give it a cute name. Mush mushroom controller. Pa Pine apple. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Twenty five Euro. Okay. Yeah you told me you h you d you d you lost your control your T_V_ so so you need to buy one. Okay. Traditional one? Yeah. So this one and this one. What do you choose? What do you choose? Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So buy one. Yeah. Prototype  yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thanks. No not really. Just Crap. Okay. 'Kay  so whe where is the remote control? Yep. What slides? Yeah. Yeah  because mushroom was not in the trends. I mean there was fruits yeah. Yeah. I don't think it is. Mm-hmm. Yeah. But anyway this is not a mushroom anyway  so it's fine. No  I mean  yeah yeah. Inspira inspiration is True. But we say uh we sa we said solar. Yeah. I mean  we gonna try to measure how good it is instead of just talking about uh we had three keys key points to uh for this remote control design  and first one was uh fancy look and feel. So w we'll try to judge this feature uh with a one to seven scale  one being uh no  I think. Uh just let me check. One one being true  and seven being false. Okay. Ouch. So Do we have a fancy look and feel  according to you? But is it Uh I'll agree it's unique  but is it really Yeah I mean  fancy was was defined by s fruit and vegetable look. Yeah. I dunno where the lemon is  but I mean it's not obvious. If I dunno  maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or Yeah. I dunno. Yeah  it's getting Okay. Yeah  that's Wait th that's the second point. First one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel. I mean No  the colour is okay  that's fine. I mean it's but I would say there is more too much red. Um if Right. So  from one to seven? No  seven is false and one is true. Three? Okay. Three. Then uh let me The other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative. Yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh I dunno  in the core  or single. Mm-hmm. No  that's good. Yeah. Yeah  th that's another really good point. Maybe okay. So using the same scale  two? Okay. Now maybe the most critical one. L last one w I would like to judge is is it easy to use? Yeah but this this turning can you can you just re explain me the Please. Yeah. Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels? Like if you want to go from Yeah but imagine you y Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to if you wanna jump from  I dunno  one to twenty? How can you go directly to twenty  for example? Yeah. Yeah. I agree. I agree. But I mean if you're fro from two? Yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh We're not talking Yeah. Yeah. How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one? So you you count one degree  two degrees  no. I don't think so. Yeah voc vocal command is okay. But w we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th l the main And this would be more for browsing  ah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah  I mean you're famous. You. Mm. Okay the uh th this looks better. Yeah. Yeah  but it has to be on to recognise fas Ah  that's not the ecological part  yeah. Solar. So  which number? So reasonably  is four  is one? So  three. Uh we wouldn't say  I mean  those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me. I'd like I mean this is the just a prototype. I'm not really convinced it's so easy to use  but I don't know. Yeah. So you have yeah. Uh by pushing zero after after the first one. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah  if you're changing your mind. Fine to coarse. Okay. But this this has to stay on the table  right? This has to stay on the table. Yeah but then uh when you turn turn it Just It's Yeah. You know tha that's the weak point  because with a traditional one you just have one hand. Sure. Yeah  you would never you would never lose this one  yeah. Yeah. Four. Uh it's even easier to maybe. Ok Mm. So  average? Three? Okay  so Yeah  especially on the easy to use target. Okay. Mm-hmm. No. So we are all already nineteen. Yeah. That's gonna be double curved  yeah. Rather four buttons. Oh no  interface. Yeah  yeah that's special colours  sure. Yeah tha that's wheel. Yeah. I think the price is okay. Um  no. Yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells. Yeah. No y i it did change  but just imagine we have Yeah. Yeah but this one one of the feature we were not really Yeah. Yeah  if Yeah. Yeah  that's one of the requirement. We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black. Black then is a regular colour  so. Yeah  one. Yeah. So push button then it's it's the next expensive one. Yeah  thi this might be. Close to. Okay  so what's the bottleneck? Double curved. Yeah  but flat Case  what's the ca And then one Euro left. Um. Um So we have one button  one wheel. It's good they're not charging anything for that. Yeah y actually it's wrong. We're not under twelve Euros and a half. Okay. Okay. Solar cells. Yeah. That's nice argument  but if it's it's still four our of twelve. Yeah. Yeah but we just have one button. Easy. I don't know about powerful. Yeah. Mm. Uh that's what we've just done. Yeah. Um okay. Well I think we have just have to discuss if I dunno. Uh tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings  maybe. 'Cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards  so it um. Yeah  but just don't trust too much the trends. 'Cause fruit and vegetables it won't last for ten years uh. Maybe two years it's dead. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  but this is good because it's not a long long life product. T_V_ is more like fifteen years  maybe  so. If you have a lemon lemon T_V_ for fifteen years Yeah  yeah. Tha that would that would make it. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. It's party party remote control. Yeah. Uh-huh. Twenty five Euros. Yeah  I think it's It's cheap  yeah. No  I I'm not so happy about the fruit shape  you know. Yeah. No  the colours are uh it's perfect  yeah. True. Uh yeah  another thing is the logo is missing still. Uh Still that was one of the requirements we had. It's yeah but it I don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Cute na You cannot say mushroom because it's not the trend. It's not the trend. Yeah  but just flying saucer  or I would say flying saucer. It's more appropriate  somehow. Mm. Mm. Yeah but that's going to be expensive  you know. We had some problems going to twelve Euros and uh I dunno. Yeah  afterwards  if if it's a new trend. Okay. We should celebrate. Mm. Yeah. Our final prototype which yeah. Mm-hmm. So  ready? Sorry  I I um I'm afraid Uh thi this remote control will stay a prototype. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Effectively one slide and maybe we can discuss everything. Okay. Yeah. Uh Yeah  yeah I'm sure. Yeah  that's true. Yeah. Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh like lemon shape  you know  centre is yellow and t d To integrate  you know yeah. I don't think I hope nobody will eat it. You know  to integrate the fruit aspect  you know the the in Really? But Fruit and vegetable  so mushroom was a kind of you know uh Mushroom? Oh  uh I'm not sure. We can it's a veg a kind of vegetable  but you know we we integrated them with different colour. I I think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable you know. This  you know  very enlighted colours  you know. And inspired colour and and very sophisticated material  so. And so So what we w what I can add is that  you know he talk about what is outside  so what is inside is what we dis what we talked before about  you know  the chip  it is a low level chip  and You know  we don't need to k. You know wi the low level chips inside and you know the L_C_D_ button and the i The battery it is under. It is in th in in the base  yeah. In fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and I don't think so  but it it's might be okay  so. I it might be okay. So Yeah. So  four point three point five  it means it's acceptable. Oops. I think you have nice colours. I don't The sha the bowl shape people like. Is it really fancy? But it's you have the lemon aspect of this th this this thing. Do Don't do that  please. I it's it's i this shape is a lemon like  so Yeah. Because i Less button. Yeah  but you don't have any button now. That's uh yeah  is that that's a good idea. So that's great. That's great. I have no idea  so. I have no idea what If it is fancy or not. So we can we can say t The colour  is the colour acceptable? So the shape now. It's too much red? In the basement? I will give I will I'll gi I'll give two or three. Three  it's okay. Three  three. Three is fine for me. What other Is it easy to use? Ye uh Embedded. It's a micro array  okay. Oh yeah  yeah. And I think you you've never seen a rou a round remote control  so it is I W Yeah  but I see  you have microphone array embedded. You have That's good. And you have  you know this ki this solar receptor that  you know Yes. Yeah. I think technically it's acceptable  so Yeah. Two  yeah  two. It's it's fine  so. Most Eh  for th the vocal command yes  it's might be easy. But it's just speaking. You just need the command. As a principle. I think maybe if you he If you hear some click Yeah  it would Oh yeah  that's difficult. That's dif that's difficult. Yeah but y how you need to know I I think something that Yeah. And you you can I think you can if you have a scale  so Yeah  it's a bit difficult. I think b but the the vocal command is easy too. You can say fifty and fifty it's okay  so Uh  yeah  and y that's yeah. Yeah. To see uh yeah uh Yeah. And but I'd It is a turn off t turn off button  maybe. Yeah  yeah yeah. That's that's very technologic  so. Yeah. S But I di I didn't see where the t f the turn off t turn on turn off button so much activates maybe one of the Uh it's k on off  yeah. Yeah  sleeping. To compensate. Yeah. Easy to use  it's very relative but three it's fine  I think  it's reasonable three. Three f three for me  it's o it's okay. Four or three. Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and no and just take the mean. Will you give four? Five? Yeah  so maybe if Yeah but y you know You just push two button  zero and and one. And that's Are there some buttons? Okay. In fact on a flat place You can Oh ye yes  that's right. Oh my God. yeah maybe  maybe may it's the next prototype  maybe we cou Four. Maybe four  it's okay. I'll put four. Yeah  four it's more reasonable. You can you can erase with this er yeah. Yeah  four it's more reasonable  so. So it's nine  nine over three. Oh yeah  it's. It need maybe some wo further work  but it's Yeah  uh s yeah. Might it might be fine. Yeah  b I think Yeah  yeah. That's the finance. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah  we have battery. No  um solar cells  yeah. Uh I think in each ball you have three three uh yeah  three  yeah. Three three solar cells. S s simple  simple  yeah. Yeah. Mm. One maybe  yeah. Yeah yeah yeah. Is it Is sh it Wooden. Is Yes a wooden pl I and that's There's no wood  so plastic just only  I think. Double curve  yeah  double curve. One  you have. But it's yeah  a a rubber uh Yeah  yeah. Y y yeah  yeah. Five? I think that this will be like a scroll wheel  actually. Y you tu you turn you turn it  so Yeah  true. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Okay  yeah  yeah. Scr L_C_ display  maybe. Interface. It's okay. fine. Yeah  it was stage one  so. So I think you can transform the wood into plastic  maybe. Because uh it seems that this can be yeah  wood into plastic and it it should be fine. Yeah  red and yellow. Fancy. One. I can remove maybe f you have five with push buttons  so we can just  I dunno  try to modify some of them to have yeah. Double curve. We can transform the double curve into single c yeah. F some Single curve. Single curve should be fine  so. Oh  what It's it's a bad idea  so. Two? One. That's fine. That's fine. One s one scroll wheel  so And the vocal chord  it's fine. It I th it's fine. It's fine. It's under or equal. It's fine  so It's fine  twelve fifty uh The solar cells  r is i is it? Yeah  to be able to si to sell it. Yeah  with mi It's it is really really uh really very very expensive  though. Maybe if uh okay. Yeah  yeah. It's easy to use. It's very easy to use. No. We've done it with it is under the if it was low  high or so. So So what are we going to do with this project evaluation? Okay  okay  it's fine. Yeah  I think I find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to from the beginning to the end. And designing  looking at the chips  the solar cells and uh and it was very informative for. Yep. Okay  okay. Yellow. I think you can think about a yellow T_V_ now after a fruit T_V_ or I dunno. It can be an interesting I don't know Yeah  just a lemon T_V_ it'd be yellow lemon. It's flat  uh Yeah  that's right. It's really boring  yeah. Yeah. Yeah  that's that would be really interesting  actually. Device devi The fruit? Yeah. Yeah  it's But I think it's good to follow the f flow and you know make it now and after  you know  if the people change their mind you change also the product. Yeah. Yeah  yeah. That's a yeah  yeah. We can think about T_V_ with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones  you know. Yeah  you customise it every ti so every ti if people change  you just change the appearance  and y y you can keep Yeah  you can keep the global appearan The mood of persons  the fashions uh We int Yeah  T_V_  yeah. A T_V_ for autumn and a T_V_ for winter  you know  so it's So what i and do w is it Okay. Yeah  the pr at Yeah but I think f it's really a celebrating object. So it's yellow and very a very ha it's very happy  so. Uh it's it's a pr it's like yeah. Yeah  right  go and sell it. Goo and good luck  so It should be fine. Wh really? It should be it should be fine  you know  actually. S I I think I like the the colour a the colour are very good  so actually so It's perfect  and I p is th y the the yellow ball thing that Uh f like y we can we can put some uh double R_ Okay yeah  yeah. That's actually good idea  so It's not a mushroom. It's a pineapple remote controls. Yeah  pineapple remote remote control. Oh  that Oh unid uh unidentified remote control  so That's that's pineapple remote control. I think it's fine. Yeah. Yeah I will try I'll try. I can hel I will try versions so to see how easy easy to manage Yeah I always lose my Yeah  so so i if it is a universal one I can use it with my T_V_  so it would be I think I would choose this one because of the colour. It's it's will enlight your house  your home and your T_V_  so. Yeah. Yeah  yeah that would be uh an idea.. Yeah that's that fine. So we can celebrate now. That's our new product. Yes. It's it's fine. It's I like it. Next time. Well  I'll buy one here. Yeah. No? Okay. Okay. Final prototype  yeah  ye yeah. Okay. Okay. S so who is going to take the remote control? ,The User Interface Designer presented the prototype of the product to the group. The product featured an LCD display  a flip panel  and a customizable case back. The Project Manager displayed the cost of all of the components  and the group decided that the current budget would not allow the addition of the LCD display. The Project Manager decided to negotiate the cost of production to allow the addition of the display. The Marketing Expert gave a presentation on sales projection and showed that the current projected sales point would probably not allow the project to reach its profit aim. The group also discussed the distribution and promotion of the product on the internet. The User Interface Designer expressed concern that there would not be time under the current plan to make changes to the product resulting from consumer testing; the Project Manager decided that no additional changes would be made. The group then discussed other means of promoting the product: launching the remote at the same time as a large sporting event or DVD release. 
Can try to plug that in there but Right. That's what we have there. That's plastic. Plastic covered with rubber. We might uh add some more underneath here. Maybe give it  give it a form. I mean you're supposed to hold it like that  but um just if you grab it  take it from somewhere  so yeah  you have some rub yeah. Exactly  use both. Might as well think about Th think about the button as well. Like either put either one one on either side or not do it at all. It's a quick on-off button. That's um yeah I think it's pretty important. So you don't have to fiddle with that. Right? Um that's not um I'd say a bit smaller would probably be nice. You wanna play with that over there. There you go. Right.. I'd say  when it comes to the ergonomics  the form and stuff  yes that's definitely more beautiful than your average. However the colour  we don't have a say in that. That has been  that has been dictated pretty much by the company. So uh to answer that honestly I would rather say like uh  we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly  definitely. 'S nothing you can say about that. I mean I much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form. But Right. Right. It's different. You don't want your uh three feet huge L_C_D_ dis display in your living room that's hanging from the wall to be controlled with something like that. Yeah. Yeah. It's very intuitive  I think yeah. S give it a one. Right. Right. So that's a one. Something that big and that yellow you just don't lose anymore. Oops. Hmm. Well what S Mm. Oh yeah. You probably Mm. Y you could add an extra feature actually. Which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television. We could add that but that's nothing we have thought of so far. Yes. It's it's Um the it's based on this anti anti-theft technology for suitcases and stuff  where you have one piece that's attached to your luggage  another piece that starts beeping. That can't cost much. So that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to to hide  so you have one piece  you have to glue somewhere behind your stick it behind your T_V_ and the other Right. That'd be tough then. Well also your remote would uh alarm you if somebody stole you t your television  yeah. Ran off with it without taking the beautiful remote control. Let's add one of those features and say yes. Two. Uh It's all just It's all just stolen technology when it comes down to right right right right. Yeah not really. Right. Yeah well you have that  kind of  sort of. It's not a one though. One would be the whole thing to fold and stuff. Yeah. So that's a four at most. Y yes. More Well the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the L_C_D_ and the way you operate it than the form and the colour  but it definitely is. I'm impressed. I can't do that without a calculator. Fifty percent  you're kidding. P It's too much. Um Uh Battery. Two. At four it's gonna be too heavy  so that that's not our problem. People can change it every month. They won't know until after they bought it.. That's the advanced chip-on-print  yeah. Double curved  yes. Plastic. N no. No that's just one. It's just one mo single mould  we can do that. Exactly  right. That's not a special colour. It's a specially ugly colour  but it's not special. S Yes unfortunately. We could of course make the buttons wood. Say mahogany or so Mm-hmm or titanium. Uh just Yeah that's too much. It's hard to believe. So we'll go for the hand dynamo huh? I mean let's let's face it  it also depends on the software on the on the television. You can have the the information that this thing transmits be being displayed on the on the screen. So s yeah let's take away the Yeah. Yeah. Right. Right. We may not need it. There you go. Perfect. Okay  the So we can just take away a heck of a lot of the there you go. central? Oh that's just yeah. There you go. Oops. There you go. One more criteria. Fair enough. Great. Yeah. Just half a day  you have a remote. There you go. Super super. Well that's not my fault. That's obviously the people I work for uh that work for me  uh they've just you know Heads are gonna roll  believe me. Yes yes.. The prototype discussion. No. There is our remo the banana. Um yeah basically we we st went with the colour yellow. Um working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned  it's basically designed around a banana. Um but it would be held in such a fashion  where it is  obviously it wouldn't be that floppy 'cause this would be hard plastic. These would be like the rubber  the rubber grips. So that's so that would hopefully help with grip  or like the ergonomics of it. Um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel. You have to use your imagination a little bit. And this here represents the screen  where you  where you'd go through. And the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an iPod  where that one way ch through channels  that way th other way through channels. Volume up and down. And then to access the more complicated functions you'd you sorta go  you press that and go through the menus. It's that that simple. That just represents the infrared uh beam. That's a simple on and off switch. Um I don't know  we could use the voice. T that blue bits should be yellow  d that that'd be where the batteries would be I suppose. And um that's about it. It's as simple as you  we could make it really. Is there anything you want to add? Yeah. Doesn't make much make much difference. You could work left-handed or right-handed I suppose. T the actual thing might be smaller. Yeah. Just the on and off. Yeah. It's you know it's flimsy 'cause it's made out of heavy Play-Doh  but And whether or not it would fall into the cost everything I suppose. With the scroll and the L_C_D_. Yeah. I would. It's bright. It's It's curved. It's not there's no sharp angles to it. Some people might say it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think that was the main aim  one of the main aims that we had. Uh yeah. 'Cause we've we've brought it down to basically four controls most common  which are channel and volume. And then the other ones are just a matter of just going  just scrolling further. Yeah. Yeah. It's bright yellow. Bright yellow's hard to lose. But um if we were to  if we were  that  the speech recognition. That  we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing. That was what we'd we'd mentioned. Just just to use  to find it when it was lost. But like I said  like I don't think you'd lose something so yellow so easily. And it's not gonna fall  like a rectangle would slip down behind things. That's gonna be a difficult shape to Yeah. Maybe in the middle again  three or four or something? I mean you know loo losing things is one of those things that people can lose  I mean a million ways. You can pick it up and walk away with it and then you've lost it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah true. But I mean d just those whistling  clapping key rings you have. They're cheap. So it can't be that expensive. Yeah. Yeah. stick it on the T_V_. Yeah. Two. I'd say so. Uh don't get many mo remote controls with screens on. Yeah it's stolen technology. But we have. Fa 'cause it's stolen. No maybe not. Yeah as much as as needed  I think. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. On the Yeah. Be what we were told  and they'd say yeah  definitely.. Is that some long division? No. Just  I'm sure there's a. No I can't do long very impressive. Yeah. Yeah so. You'd been going a long time dividing that. It's two point four two eight five se it just keeps going on. Two point four two basically. Charge about three hundred quid for it. We're advanced chip are we? Yeah yeah. S That's Yeah. And then I'd say the integrated. Mm. remote control. No that's getting a bit tiny. Yeah. I'd ignore that. If it w What if we completely took out the the one single button we've got on. And just had a scroll wheel interface. And the L_C_D_ display. I suppose the L_C_D_ C_ display's the one that's pushing it up a bit though. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah you could maybe take out the L_C_D_ dis display even  if it if it comes up on the computer itsel on the T_V_ itself. Uh that is possible yeah. There we go. Screen. Make it a bigger dial. Easier to use. Even easier to use then. That was just we ran out of yellow. There you go. Even simpler. Yeah. For all those fruit lovers out there. Yeah. I think we did yeah I think we did quite well. Um Yeah. Right from the start of the day. We sort of knew where we were going straight away I thought. Yeah. We've used the whiteboard. Technology used. Excellent. Pretty impressive. Kind of a banana. I do. Okay. You guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria. Um. Okay. So first I'll just discuss some of the criteria that I found. Just based on the past trend reports that I was looking at earlier. And then we'll do a group evaluation of the prototype. And then we will calculate the average score to see how we did. Um so the criteria we're gonna be looking at are the complaints um that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier. So we're gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale. And one is going to mean true  that we did actually achieve that. With seven being false  we did not achieve that.. Okay. So for the first one  we need to decide  did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote? Mm. Mm. Yeah I think the colours detract a little bit. That's true. Yeah. Um okay so  do you think  since we This was a a sign criteria  do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle then? Does that sound good? What do you think? Three? Four? Five? Four is fair. Okay. Okay  the second one. Did we make it simple for new users? One  'kay. Okay. Um  do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users? I'd say that So one? Yeah? Okay. Okay um the fourth one. How about the problem of a remote being easily lost? One of the number one complaints. Whether you want to or not  you're not gonna lose it. Okay. That's true. Mm. Annoying alarm or something? Yeah. So. Are we adding one of these two features? gonna say okay. So we're back to a one? Or a two? Two  'kay. Okay. Are we technologically innovative? From iPod yeah. But for remotes yeah. Two? Three? But how many remotes do you see like this? Not so many. Really? Okay. That's gonna hurt us. Okay. Um spongy material? 'Kay. And lastly  did we put the fashion in electronics? I'd say we did. 'Kay. Alright. Now we just gotta calculate. Six eight twelve sixteen. Seventeen divided by s Eight. Well I haven't done math in years. What two I dunno. Okay we'll say two point four two. Right? How does that look? It's been a while. Oh no. They just told me to pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it basically. So that's that. Oh my god. Okay. Yeah we'll go with that. Not too shabby. Right. Oh. Bright yellow. It'd look really lovely. Yeah. Leave it blank. Perfect.. What's the blue part? Oh that's the batteries. Okay. Looks more like a banana. Trying to fill in some time there. Good teamwork. Minus your PowerPoint fiasco. No I know. I'm yeah. Incom Mm. Kinda. We might have a while though. Yep. Soon as I get this. Okay. This is our last meeting. Um I'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting. Uh and then we'll have a  the prototype presentation. Um then we will um do an evaluation. Uh or we'll see what  what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation. Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget. Um then we'll do the evaluation  and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we'll need to make  or hopefully everything will fall right in line. Um let's see  minutes from the last meeting. Um we looked at uh the the trends. We had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy look-and-feel. It was twice as important as anything else. Um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles. Um and a spongy feel. So we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype. Um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity. Um then we looked at the uh the method for coming up with our own remote. Um looking at other other devices. Um the iPod  we really liked the look of that. Um we also had uh the kid's remote for a simple idea. Um a two part remote  which was what were were originally looking at. Uh and then um there was talk of spee uh speech recognition um becoming more uh predominant and easier to use. But I think we've still decided not to go with that. Then we looked at the components um the materials for the case  the different energy sources  the different types of chips  um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote. Um and basically how  what were making for the prototype. So I'm going to leave it at that and let you guys take over. The prototype yeah. Do you need a this? Okay. Very nice. Mm-hmm. What but what's that button? Uh  'kay. 'Kay. Would you like to uh Well done. Well luckily we are going to find out. Or not luckily. Um do you have a marketing presentation for us. I think it's definitely different than anything else out there. So if they think that what is out there is ugly  then yes I would say  I would say most definitely. It's bright. It still has your traditional black. Yep  not angular. Mm. Yep. Yeah something more modern to go a a modern colour to go with the modern form. Yeah. I would say four. Very non-committal  four. Yeah. Mm-hmm. S scrolling through and selecting a few. I think that's a one. So if we incorporate speech recognition into it then it could And it is quite bright and Uh Yeah. But if we do go with the  with the speech recognition  then it  then our scale goes up quite a bit I think. Probably two. You know. If we eliminate the fact that you know it's impossible to guarantee that it's not gonna be lost then I'd say two. With the speech recognition  which of course may be changed depending on budget. Which  which may be cheaper than speech recognition if it were just a Some sort of proximity Pray that you don't accidentally lose that piece. Okay. Two. It's But there's not a lot of yellow  there's not a lotta yellow. Course that wasn't really we were kinda forced to take that colour. I don't know that we are that innovative  to tell you the truth. If we added the screaming factor then we go up. Um I would say we're probably at four. We have some spongy  yeah. No. Yeah. Because it's only got what  these parts are the grips and perhaps the back side the bottom the underneath on the back. Probably a four at most. Possibly even a five. If your fashion is b is Carmen Miranda  you betcha. It's true. Seven is Two point two point four? Something. And what what is the acceptable criteria? Is there like a scale that we have to hit? Alright then. Okay. Well  let's see. Now we get to do the budget numbers. You didn't know that you were gonna have a budget. But we do. Okay. So I have here an Yeah. We want a fifty percent profit on this. Oh you can't really see that very well. Twelve and a half Euros is what supposed to cost us. Okay  so Well let's see. The f the Wonder if I can make this What the Oh it won't let me do that. Okay. Alright so at top  I don't know if you guys can read that or not. I can't 'cause I don't have my glasses on  but so we've got the energy source. There's uh four  five  six categories. We have energy source  electronics  case. Then we have case material supplements  interface type  and then button supplements. Okay so Uh first of all energy source  we picked battery. Um and how many batteries do we think this will probably take? Probably some e either two or four. Two? Like it. Excellent. This is consumerism. Alright so for the electronics our choices are simpl simple chip-on-print  regular chip-on-print  advanced chip-on-print  sample sensor  sample speaker. 'Kay  we have one of those. 'Kay then the case is a Probably it's double curved. Case materials are plastic. Um I guess it's two  since one for the top  one for the bottom. Is that right or is it just one? Maybe it's one because of the 'Kay. I guess it doesn't matter 'cause the price on that one is zero  which is nice. Special colour? Interface type. We have pushbutton  scroll-wheel interface  integrated scroll-wheel pushbutton  and an L_C_D_ display. So we actually have the L_C_D_ display and then is it the integrated or is it Yeah. 'Kay. Button supplement? Special colour? Um special form? Special material. Or titanium. They cost us all the same. Well we only have one button so really we shouldn't be charged  we shouldn't be charged anything for the the button supplements. Um Okay. We're gonna leave that one blank because we run on a L_C_D_ and scroll. So our total is fifteen point five. Which I believe is by three Euros over. So the only thing better than um a banana-shaped remote is one that you shake. Yeah 'cause the Well 'cause we have to have both right? Mm-hmm. So we may not need the L_C_D_ display? Well there we go. Twelve point five. Okay. So we just remove our screen here. Besides look at what the L_C_D_ does to our lovely remote. Back to the design room boys. Okay so the costs under twelve point five Euro. Was no. We redesigned it. Now it's yes. Next slide. Project evaluation. Uh project process  satisfaction with  for example  room for creativity  leadership  teamwork  means  new ideas found. Um So I guess that Let's see here. I think that perhaps the project evaluation's just supposed to be completed by me. But I'd like to hear your thoughts. Uh h what did you think of our project process? Good. Yeah I think we st we started off a little little weak. Our leadership was quite weak in the beginning. Um um But as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing. Um room for creativity? There was that. Um I think we tried a lotta different things and um I think it was um interesting as you guys brought up more um information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things. Um you guys worked together well as a team. And um the means? Which was the whiteboard and the pens. I had some problem with the pen I think  but minus your p Well Have a we have a list of employees that you would like fired. Okay. N new ideas found? Um Yes for the remote. Maybe no not f for technology. Alright. Closing. Costs are within the budget. Project is evaluated. Um complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary. That's it. And I still have to do my minutes for the last meeting. Actually. Um so there will probably be another questionnaire coming up. And then we'll have to check with the main boss whether we can  what goes on after that. But that's the end of our meeting. ,The participants introduced themselves and their roles to each other. The Project Manager introduced the aim of the project and gave a brief agenda for the entire project. He then introduced and explained how to use the meeting-room materials. The group acquainted themselves with the materials by drawing on the smartboard. The Project Manager presented the project budget and explained that the device would not be made very high-tech due to the small budget. He explained that the device would be sold internationally. The group discussed their initial ideas of features to include in the design; the Marketing Expert discussed usability features  such as the ability to control multiple devices and an LCD screen  to make the product unique. The Project Manager instructed the Industrial Designer to work on the working design and the User Interface Designer to research the technical functions. The group discussed the timing of when they would make decisions on the features discussed. 
How was lunch? Mm. Why? Mm-hmm. W we can use something like you know the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts like to make it feel better and to you know Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay  and still we have mm can we still include the L_ L_S_D_ display? L_C_D_ yeah L_C_D_. No  it's not gonna be a t no touchable but still like a source of information or source for menus. Okay  so let's try it  let's t Yeah  yeah  it's it's not gonna be a touch pad  uh just a display for giving you information. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No more questions. Mm yeah  yeah. But still uh L_S_D_'s already quite nice  L_C_ I'm an artist  sorry. So uh  that's not I hope that's not too much. Okay. Uh participant number three. Uh mm mm uh have a look at this no it's yeah. Uh so the concept of the interface. Generally I developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface  but for possible instruction or user's manual and uh all the complex things that come together with your T_V_ and remote controls. So let's start with this. We got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons and uh we got explanation for every button and you can use your time and uh it will take i some days to learn all this buttons and um the L_C_D_ is going to be somewhere here and uh go back button  I don't know really where it is  maybe one of this buttons  and um power on and off mm I I don't remember so uh it it it should be maybe this button is power on and off? Or no? I can see nothing. So that's our concept. It's called the millennium remote control. Yeah. Really? I thought you like it. Ah okay just press the button  please uh. Yeah  we will not use this. We will not use this. But instead of this I will devise That's our concept. And it's got just few buttons  quite low looking  and all this stuff we already we already discussed. And uh what will people say? They'll say it's perfect. Or what will say? Uh they will say it's splendid. And uh e everyone will say I'll buy it. And everyone's gonna be satisfied. I would make a backlight of the L_C_D_ screen with different colours. Not the case. Yeah. Okay  so let's remember there's a Nokia phone which changeable panels. Do you like it? That's why you don't have it. That's why  'cause it's nasty. No. Um  I am here. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. Okay  what uh there's one more decisi uh one more solution in fact  um 'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are  like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around  like what colour is around  and depending on the temperature  yeah. We can make it in fact. If if if the okay. Mm-hmm  mm-hmm  so Uh-huh. So  be an option  yeah. Yeah  yeah  yeah. But you know if you want to be different you just take your remote control with you all the time. And it makes you different  you know? Anyone has their remote controls here? No? Mm-hmm. Okay. Uh-huh  uh-huh. Could we integrate something into our remote control  something like light? That they can use it in darkness  like. Hand light  yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay. S well  let's go on maybe with the presentation. And um the remote control's going to be smart but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much? And uh I dunno that's a question to you and to mm to Mm-hmm. Okay  okay. So just just just just think about it um. Thank you. Uh yeah I just want to say it should be real smart. Voice recognition is quite tough. I say don't use it  and the control just looks. 'Cause I ordered jus To l to l lock it. Yeah  sure. Mm-hmm. Okay  thanks. What is spongy? Okay. Okay. So we have to uh for yeah so are we confident enough on creating trends? Well  we can make it smell like fruit. Yeah. Mm-hmm  mm-hmm. Could we make a titanium shape? I mean fruit-shaped. But Doub double-curved. Okay  okay. In fact I just agreed to make uh to make the like titanium panels on a whole rubber body. Well  okay w we'll see. Yeah We'll see. We'll see. We'll see. I I really don't like this modelling clay 'cause you know it makes some for for I dunno uh yeah um we'll look. Okay  okay. Alright  alright. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Thanks Don't be sarcastic. Mark. Uh Rama. Ah. Mm-hmm. What is a double-curved shape? Uh-huh. The cost. Mm like this? Mm-hmm. Speech L_C_D_. Seems not  it's either L_C_D_ or push-button. Ah. The L_C_D_ would The display would only be display and not uh touch sensitive you mean. Just uh for output  yeah. Yeah. I guess no um. So the batteries uh are going to be very light. Okay. So this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just uh the finding it basically  instead of clapping why not just be ask. Mm-hmm. Okay. No  it's okay. Puts less of constraint on what we can do but it's always like that. We have dreams and the in the end we find out that it's not feasible. Anyway. Yeah. L_C_D_. L_S_D_ is something else  and it's quite nice as well. So  go on uh artist. Hmm. Let's change millenniums. doesn't make sense. This is very ugly. Oh no  too much concept. Ah. Ah  back today. Do you think it can come in several colours? Or did the Um but not the case. Uh the case would only be in that uh aluminium uh titanium stuff  like Yeah  well they like uh something which is uh Mm yeah  okay  so that would be the option. I don't know I don't have a Nokia phone  but I don't use that but again  uh I might Yeah  bu but Mm-hmm. Kind of upgradable uh remote control. Wow  wow. Mm. Like a chameleon. Mm-hmm. Because uh I think there are two kinds of people. Those for which the remote control is uh is to be uh something useful uh I'm going to talk about this later but and those for which is something that that that uh is uh specific to them so it it's like a signature. My remote control is pink. Nobody else than me has a pink remote control. And that makes me special. I think I think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that. Those who wanted to have it pink. No mm no. It might be optional  yeah. The the young people the young people want to be different from their friends. Although similar but have something just slightly better. Pink Mm. Yeah. Yeah  yeah. You always have your remote. Oh  you don't? Yeah. You don't have your remo Wh you you know like for instance take the iPod. It's a kind of remote control. Uh it's white and it's so white that you see it from any anywhere. It has this distinctive look and feel and look which people seems to like just because it's a colour that we don't usually see in a remote control. White. Seems important. Mm glow in the dark  so Okay. Yeah. Uh-huh  yeah sure. Well so I heard that uh it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done uh so that's the smartness of the thing. Currently we don't have guns with speech recognition or uh beer cans with speech recognition but we may have remote controls with speech recognition. I dunno. Don't touch the remote. But yeah. Are are you saying here that uh the remote controls should be aware of who is using it? So for instance the young guy would not be able to use it because his father doesn't want. Like with some Maybe fingerprint recognition or Mm. Um Mm. Okay. So it could be smart in that way. But for instance th I I'm thinking about the other uh uh particularity that the the remote control could have. S since it it knows who is using it  it might also record the kind of uh channels you are u more often using and uh levels of volumes that you're more often uh things like that and provide you ways of using them  I dunno  somehow  I dunno  that might be expensive but that might also be a good sales pitch again. The remote that knows you. My turn? Okay  it's alright. Four  I think. Trend  yeah. No uh yes. Okay  so I'm going to talk about trends and um I hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control. So  next slide please. So first maybe just a small recap on how how do we watch trends so it's not so uh simple you might think that it's easy but uh it's not so simple. Anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know  so have to to go often on the web and look at uh what the others are doing  and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day uh or any other tool that is similar to a remote control which basically is a small device that people have with them  always  like a phone. We can we can use the phone as a as a good uh uh example of where to in be inspired. Of course those tha d who are watching the trends are also have also to be inspired because in fact they're not only watching the trends  they're inventing it  they're creating the trend. I hope I'm going to try to help you on that. This is more risky because you're not following the trend  you try to invent it  which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you don't and you're out of business. So anyway uh next slide please. Uh to be to be quick there's a lot of words here but uh basically there are uh in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very pay much attention to. The first one  which seems to be the most important one  is that it has to be fancy  it has to have a fancy look and feel. And uh interestingly this is the very most important thing. It has to be fancy. Strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be  it has to be technologically i innovative  it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing which we w may think that would have been the most important  which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control. So as you see uh it first have to be very nice  s something that people are proud of uh uh that i uh they can be id identified with uh and and then uh something that um contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends  huh  mine has this and not yours. And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control. Next slide please. Uh and now in a more uh general uh uh broad way of seeing th uh the thing. If we look back and not uh look at only remote controls I think it's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas so currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like Paris and Milan  well  it seems that this year things should have uh a fruit and vegetable uh way of of look or feel or so. And I think of course uh i it applies to everything. That's the thing with trends. It it can travel f from clothe to furniture same idea. Fruit and vegetable. Think fruit and vegetable. And uh if we co we compare to last year  now it has to be spongy  yeah. Well this so so I think uh uh i When we were talking about rubber  I think uh the rubber aspect might be important because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess. Seems not  seems not. Yeah. So Think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy  as a even in the shape it has to be more round and uh more uh uh look natural somehow. I mean And not those futuristic uh remote control with angles and uh and titanium like. So that's what people seem to yeah i I know it's quite far from what you thought but that's that's fashion and Okay that's all I have to say. These I'm sorry. Yeah  yeah we have people uh uh listening to the trends everywhere in the world  of course  as you know our company is quite big and uh so I'm just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go in the stores and when they ask uh their uh friends that are also well. No  it's not it's not this this is very general  yeah. But it seems that trends travel across things. The what we Sure. Yeah. We have to I think we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables but we still have to put our chips inside  so of course. This is your problem. This is not mine. Yeah  I think in the colours and in the uh the kind of material. If if it's something like rubber made or I think it it's also going to be good. Okay? Yep. Thanks. Mm-hmm. Okay. Thanks. Spongy. No  we don't have to  but seems it's the trend. Again  as I said we can also try to make it  to create the trend. So there's no Well  that's you t can try to convince us. Okay. that's a good idea  I Uh I think i yeah i it's again in this uh what I said first it has to be fancy so I think if nobody else pro provides currently a remote control with that kind of stuff and if we can provide it I think it's a good sell for us because we have it and others don't. It's fancy. Whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important. Maybe you could explore the two option. Mm. Seems to be. If you have time. For creation. You can paint it afterward. No problem. We have a very large department of paint. You will do it. Yeah. The thing is that uh if we want to have as he says if we want to have uh a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are. Yeah. That's the converse to having zillions of button where each button does only one thing. Yeah. Classical  we stay classical in that we don't reinvent uh the wheel. Anyway it's very in general I think people uh change T_V_ more often than batteries of their remote control. So. Because the trend goes faster than the life of the So it's very Okay. We're done. Ramaro. Yeah  participant two. Component. Yep. So we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy  and the material and interface. For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities. First one  we can use simple battery  or we can use traditional solar cells or mm and the material we can have plastic  rubber which is good for this R_S_A_ and then uh titanium  which can be which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display. And we can use some  moving kind of thing. So  as we discussed before  we need to we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control. So this can be simple kind of programmable chip and which can use microphone sensors. And we also want to look at our remote control  so. Still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range  like we're to in our twelve Euros or around that. So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house. So uh we discussed an Excuse me. So we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells and so we would like to just use simple battery. And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or and well the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes. Like you can have two curves. Uh it's I think in manufacturing I guess it's problematic. So  we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it's really lesser uh re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_ which are uh which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive  since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition we want to reduce uh cost. Uh Uh And also like in if you put a it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things and Yeah. Yeah. Like in cell phones recently these you can with the rubber in four directions and yeah. But full assembly We'll use mainly for titanium rubber is expensive and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh. And this push buttons we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s and so we want to mo I mean we're we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money for S S Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology  so Uh l So uh it's like a Yeah maybe maybe we can see depending on how we'll come up with our full design then if we have enough money or like for and because the speech recognition technology will take at least five Euros or or something so we want to reduce the cost on display or this inter Ok Yeah  that can we we can consider  because like it won't take much money I guess  because Okay  yep. You have any further questions or? Yeah. Yeah  we're to go for li and now I think we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries for really light batteries and with uh good price. Yeah  that's then the the one thing we want to know is like because remote control is used for like in the household so it it it will be it m maybe at least five  six people want to use it so so how to uh uh how to define our re speech recognition whether we want to do s speaker independent or speaker dependent. If we're going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome and we need really m more technology and so Yeah  if if everybody in the house n to locate then we're to go for some speaker independent technology or something. Yep. Thank you. Yeah. Oh. We have uh some limitations. Three. So maybe you can use in the end and Uh Mm. Yeah. But it's uh But it would be expensive  no? If you use colour L_C_D_. Uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler. Maybe we can just if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this uh the shapes and they can have different assembly. So users have different I mean they have their own interests  colour interests and so So we can just if they want they can just pay another two Euro. Yeah. Yeah yeah yes. If they want like uh so that we can yeah. Yeah. Just they'll get few more things and few more colours. Lights  yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah. Mm. Yeah. Uh Mm. But those people will be really few  no? So like we can those Ah. Yeah. Mm. Hmm. Yeah maybe like the infrared like we can put some radium chips or something so that like at least um yeah. Yeah  that Oh. Yeah. Uh that mm that could be feasible I guess  like So since we have we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use yeah. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh it's Hmm. Four. Mm. Yeah kind of um maybe Yeah it Yeah. Yeah. We need to think about mm mm. Fruit. Even shape? More yeah. Yeah. Mm. So these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people? Or it's This you you so did you Where? Oh. Oh  okay  mm-hmm. It's not from mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. It's more general trend it's not particular to the remote control. Mm. Yeah. Yeah but some materials n they're to be uh they're to be something like solid like they can't be really spongy or yeah yeah. yeah  yeah sponge  yeah yeah at least that's Yeah yeah that yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah  looking yeah fruit. These things can be easily incorporated. We can have t colours or this shape or at least yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Look and feel de Hmm. Hmm. Mm sounds interesting. So  can we highlight the specific features of our yeah  so so we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables  that's we want to follow general trend. Yeah. So  do you think Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. That's So what about location and these things  people are really interesting on those features? Or they really like They more want these fancy features like Feature Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh we will try to explore these two options and yeah yeah. Uh yeah at least like we can make banana or yeah it's it's yeah that's a we're to look for and and s we're to see the whether rubber is expensive and d Hmm. Mm. Yeah. Maybe we can have two different assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium. we have only the plastic or the the chippy yeah fibre chips or Uh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Even design. So still we want to keep L_C_D_? Or Okay. Yeah  then we can yeah  yeah  that user friendly or Mm. Yeah. Yeah. and we just stick with two batteries so it's not any solar or yeah yeah j yeah  because Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  we're done. Yep. Okay  so now we are on the conceptual design meeting. Uh y getting close to the last is the penultim meeting. Mm great. So um I will again do the secretary part uh we will have three presentation first um uh the industrial design  first Rama then Mark and then Sammy. Um um we have to take a decision on the control remote control concepts and we have forty minutes. So what we want to the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the um first on the component concept  so what kind of energy we use uh what kind of chip on print and one ki kind of case. And also on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements. And at the end um Sammy will give um a trend watching on what he's he's been doing. It's So  let's go. First with Rama. Participant two. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm  okay. Um I want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber  if it is something that it seems to be light. Okay. You m titanium it's more uh Yes so mm Uh-huh. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh yeah so Okay  s so simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm. Okay  for the location. Hmm. Okay. So let's now go to the you don't have more question? Um mm thank you mm. Yeah. Yeah  but mm. Okay. Um yeah. Now let's talk about uh interface. Three. Which one? Okay. Mm. No. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Because apparently from your survey people like colours  no? Okay. So? Uh-huh  okay  so you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we if you want o more colours on L_C_D_  yeah. Okay. And thermodynamic also. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah but that's maybe mo too much expensive  yeah. But uh it can be in uh maybe in an a gradable version  but Mm-hmm. Okay and you think that we don't have to make to make them pay more because of uh o or this is Okay  so so i it's not uh a s base service it's a Mm. Okay. Mm-hmm. So m so maybe that's if that it's a selling point maybe it has to be the base. And you'll be different. Uh in the train uh  hello uh no. Want to change my neighbour. Mm. Mm-hmm. Iradium? Ah sorry. Mm. Okay. So mm Mm-hmm. Mm  that's a nice world. Okay. Mm. Okay. Mm. Mm-hmm. Okay. So it's yeah  Marketing Expert. Participant two? Four  sorry. Mm. Mm-hmm. S So maybe titanium it's not a good idea. Mm-hmm. Um sorry Mark. It seems to be Mm-mm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. You're old-fashioned. Sorry. Okay. Mm you have questions? Mm. Mm-hmm. Okay. No more question? Okay. So Mm-hmm. Okay  so we will have uh next meeting in thirty minutes again. Um now you have to go straight on this individual action which i which are for Rama uh wil design  um Mark the user interface design  and uh Sammy uh the product evaluation. Uh you will work together uh on a new on on a prototype using modelling clay. Mm-hmm um and I as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction. Yeah you're right  you have to So you say s S do we agree on that? Yeah. We have to. No. Okay  that's a good idea. So titanium smell like fruit. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. I I agree with uh this uh Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness. Do we take titanium smelling like fruit  or do we make spongy uh fruity-like Mm. Yeah  yeah. Don't you say that you cannot do double shape uh curved shape yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-mm. Okay  so you explore now that you're going to work together these these two. Or or spongy an yeah. Mm. Mm. Yeah I don't think w I think we have to choose. If we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy but uh it cannot be both. Ah you can pretend that it's uh titanium. Yeah  do don't worry  you you you speak with mm mm. Okay. So explore a shape. Mm I think it's what we say  that we have an uh an L_C_D_ with uh information. Not uh Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Okay. Yeah  yeah  yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. So are we mm. Okay. So see you in thirty minutes. ,The project manager stated the agenda and the marketing expert discussed what functions are most relevant on a remote  what the target demographic is  and what his vision for the appearance of the remote is. The marketing expert also brought up the idea to include a docking station to prevent the remote from getting lost and the idea to include an LCD screen. The user interface designer pushed for a user-friendly interface with large buttons  a display function  a touchscreen  and the capability of controlling different devices. The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the project manager briefed the team on some new requirements they are to abide by. The team then discussed teletext  the target demographic  the buttons the remote should have  the idea of marketing a remote designed for the elderly  an audio signal which can sound if the remote is lost  LCD screens  and language options. 
Just trying to move mine right now. They want everything  but simply. Okay. Yeah th I I can I can address some of that issue  I think  with uh my presentation. Okay. Mine will always read copy of something or other. I I copied mine before I sent it over. Hmm. Okay  my turn. Whoo. It'll be copy of component design. Yeah. Th that looks like it. 'Kay. So basic remote operation runs as follows  press button makes connection with the power source and the rest of the circuit  chip senses the connection  chip produces a morse code infra-red signal  specific to that button. So you press the button  it produces uh a signal that's encoded specifically for that button. Transistors amplify that signal and it goes to the T_V_'s centre  which interprets the signal response accordingly  changes channel etcetera. So that being said Next slide  please. Findings oh which were the required materials for the basic internal construction  so all the really simplistic functions that we just discussed  we need rubber for buttons  aluminium for battery y contacts  integrated circuit which consists of a diode  transistor  resonator  resistors  and a capacitator  all those basic things that make a circuit function. Um fibreglass and thin copper wire to create the actual circuit board itself. An L_E_D_  which is a light emitting diode  um contact discs for the buttons  plastic for the casing  and a power-source  whatever power-source we've actually determined we want. Next slide  please. Thank you. Uh personal preferences  uh to save money for the components  the remote should be mass-produced and basic materials should be bought en masse. Um if we find another company who can produce the required chips  casing  L_E_D_  any additional materials we decide we require at a less expensive rate than we ourselves are producing  we should go for it. Next slide  please. Um just talking to the um manufacturing division. They suggested power options  solar cells  hand dynamo  and kinetic power  so you shake it and it increases the power. Um I'm not sure how the hand dynamo works  they have yet to get back to me on that. So next slide  please. Suggested casing options. Okay. We can offer options for casing such as straight  curved  double-curved  you know  very specific to the customer. Options for materials  plastic  rubber  titanium  wood. I don't think anyone's gonna go for a wood one  because splinters Yeah. Um certain restrictions do apply here though. Uh latex  you can't do solar power with a latex one. So  if they want some a soft squishy rubber  they can't have the solar powered option. Double-curved  you can't do titanium. Um that would be two curvatures  so it would actually  if you the shape of your hand  you curve here and you curve here  so you could have two curves that match the shape of your hand to make it more comfortable to hold. Now if you wanted that  you can't do titanium. And uh so you functions what for the buttons  scrolling function could be very beneficial to us instead of actual buttons themselves. I think I have one more slide. No  I didn't. Um the manufacturing division also has said that um they have several types of chips and they've just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip  which we could utilise. Um push button requires a simple chip and scroll requires more complicated chip. So depends on what we decide we wanna do. In addition to that if we're offering all those different options to the customer for producing their remote  we're going to have to have multiples of each type  like a double-curved in rubber  um you know  each option should have a certain select number produced with all those options. So we'll have to mix it up  make sure we produce enough of everyone. But that could also drive up the price of the actual remote itself if they know that we only produced five thousand  you know  double-curved wooden remotes. And that's all I got. Well  we are making the chip. So  I mean But  I guess  we have to look at w what our production cost is for the chip itself anyway. Yeah. Yeah. I I thought offering some of those options for different materials that it could be made of different  you know I think we'd have to decide on the power options  maybe. So that we could reduce cost. Yeah. Okay. I think the p That's true. If we do a voice-activated locator  though  we're gonna be looking at a more substantial chip. So Honestly  I think the customer would be kind of irritated by the fact that it has a base if we did do a nice small  compact Mm yeah. Yeah. 'Kay so The only problem with that is if you forget to take it out of your pocket and it goes in wash. You know it happens. I've had three watches go that way too. Pieces everywhere. Well  we have lots of options. I don't think wood is a viable option. However  well  we only wanna sell it for twenty five Euro right? 'Cause I was thinking if we wanted to get the high in market then you could produce a few in titanium  make them a rarity so to speak. Yeah. Well the original Okay. Yeah. Good plan. Honestly I'd recommend like um uh since we're going with batteries instead of solar power  I'd recommend maybe a uh soft like latex  because we could produce  you know how cellphones have those overlays that you can change the colour. We could do uh one that fits in with the trends of the year so  because this year is all fruit  God only knows why  um we could do f a cherry cover for this year and then i if next year is stripes or solids  you know They could come back. And buy the extra case. So we could do like a b a hard base plastic  and then we could give two latex covers to start. How complicated Are we gonna go with the voice activated Well  we could give it a specific code  you know  remote missing. Yeah  see that would just irritate me. So I think having a key-phrase is much better. No. That would be like a mid-class um Yeah. So we don't actually have to go for Well  if they've just developed the sample sensor  sample speaker  it's a brand new chip. Why not introduce it in this way? I think  well  we could d r do two or we could do one small lithium  'cause you know the lithium batteries are doing quite well in most other electronic products  right? So they're more widely available now. And they also have a longer battery life than most batteries. But if you only have to replace it every five years. Well  how about a initial  you get one battery when you buy it  'cause I'm pretty sure we can get them pretty cheap on bulk. Yeah. In the sample ones that you showed us there was one that had the scroll buttons on the side  which I think if we make it curved like a hand like a hand-shape like if we put the the scroll-button on the side  that could be particularly useful. Well  if it's just up and down Volume or channel. I don't know. Mm yeah. We should probably make it that you have to depress it to activate it then  'cause oth otherwise you're not just holding it and going like this  you know. Okay. We have to make sure that logo always sticks out when we put the latex covers on  so we'll have to like have a little square or something  so that the our logo's available. Yeah  I don't think we should do that  because that would just be icky. So I think maybe putting it on a button is probably a good idea. For our base one? It'll wear off. There's nothing saying that we have to put the logo on the front of the actual The only problem is we're using a latex overlay so it actually would go over top of everything and have holes for the buttons  so I was thinking maybe instead of doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be. Yeah. Great. Play Doh. Wonderful Ooh. Yeah. Yeah. Okay  so trend watching. Uh since we do put the fashion in electronics  it is kind of important how our product looks. So I guess we can go ahead and go to the next. So what they want. Right now customers want fancy versus functional. Um basically about fifty eight percent of what they like of the product that they want  describing like the in order of how much they want  fifty eight per cent of the decision of what it should look like  fancy versus functional  and then it has to also be technologically innovative  and yet easy to use. So the customer basically is confused. They don't know exactly what they want. They want us to tell them. Yes. Exactly. So we can go to next. Okay. So in Milan and Paris recently the trends have been showing that clothing  shoes and furniture are basically just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns. So I don't know if we want to go with that um and also the spongy feel is in in contrast to last year. I don't know really  I mean I guess the spongy could relate to the buttons if we want to rather than like a hard clicky button that you find on like some mobiles and stuff  you'd want like a softer touch. I mean do you guys know what I mean. Yeah. Um. But as for the fruits and vegetable patterns  I don't know if we really want to go with that  because it is just a trend  and our product we want to stay around for much longer than just a few months  because Yeah. I mean that could just be a Spring thing right now. Okay. Awesome. Um so design preferences  um we need easy to read like large buttons  clearly labelled so that  I mean 'cause we talked about that being a problem. Um and then also buttons illuminating upon touch  you said that in your design  with the bulb. Um and that could also tie in with the colour scheme. Uh we need the Real Reaction logo and colour scheme obviously. That's one of our key goals  we wanna promote our product. And I was thinking about different types of designs and I came up with something. Actually right here. So what we could do is something like an old-fashioned telephone like this  where we put the buttons around  like we'd put a big on-off button or something else in the middle  I mean it could be the arrows or whatever for channel up and down  and then put the numbers around in like an old-fashioned dial shape. 'Cause then it'll appeal to older generation and like said retro's cool. So it's classically retro. So I mean that's just an idea if you guys like it. And  yep. And that's it. That's cute. Yeah. I have four of those remotes. Okay. That would be amazing  though  yeah. No  splinters would What is that? Mm. Right. Okay. Oh this the thing we were talking about earlier. Yeah  like using the menu to be like  enter your name into the screen like on the menu options. So that way the remote reads it. I feel like voice recognition would be  I don't know  w it would be too hard to really I mean we could do it  but Technology. And it is a growing trend  the higher technological  like the  I mean just like the more advanced it is  the better it'll sell. Yeah  'cause we need to know how big it's gonna be and how heavy. Oh the base  yeah. W We need to decide  well so we can figure how big it's gonna be  like exactly what buttons we want and exactly It could be like this. Yes. I'd  well uh This one is really comfortable  like I like the sides whatever  because But if we have the um  the locator  then we don't have to worry about that. So we can make it small if we have a l locating device. Hmm. Two double A_s  for this size. Right. Yeah. Smaller  without Yeah. I think if we had a a locating device with the small one  I think that seems way more advanced. Yeah. Yeah  because I mean if even looking at cellphones right now  those trends the smaller the hotter it is  yeah Oh. Yeah. Ouch. A phone  whoa  that would wow  that would hurt. Yeah wood. Yeah  'cause if it's gonna cost us more to produce a chip  titanium will be more expensive. Yeah. We could do that  because all our research shows that people are definitely willing to spend more if Good plan. Oh. Yeah  who knows. O or we could like take off this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  because the soft latex definitely is squishy. That's in. Well I mean squishier than like  yeah  just a hard plastic. 'Cause that uh what it type of  yeah  for voice activation would it be like a certain term what we would say like  because people could just be talking and we don't want it going off all the time. So uh Ooh. Uh see I'm uh I'm strangely attracted to it  because I know that's it's definitely gonna be big  because it's  I don't know  it's just so high-tech. Oh  then maybe voice maybe voice activation won't be good. Yeah  n n no  we just want it to be a finder. But do can your can the department make Oh  brilliant then. Yeah  good point. I think triple A_  it'll be lighter. I mean more more come in a package. Yeah. That's a good point. We could think about it and come back to it next meeting. We still have one more meeting. Yeah  it could be whatever  as long as there's something big in the middle  because like the old phones  there's like that just like piece of metal or like a picture or something in the middle. Oh  that's true. Good point. So scroll buttons on the side and then buttons on top? But we definitely If we have scroll things on the side  we definitely have to have 'em labelled. Yeah  like on the side of it. Oh if it's just up and down. Well  you could do some on both sides. Yeah. That's squishy. That's squishy. have buttons. Yeah  that. Yeah. Yeah  or like a gun-metal grey  'cause then it combines the silver and the black. Yeah  buttons wear off. Hmm. But we want it to be seen. We need it to be seen. Right. Yeah. Some of tho Well  some of those buttons though are blue-based. Um well  a lot of those buttons are blue-based. Well  kind of. Um and then if v we do have them illuminate upon contact  they could illuminate yellow. Like if we like the one all the way on the left  uh you ca you can see it on your computer better. Um where the button is actually blue  but the number itself is clear or white or whatever so if you pressed it would illuminate yellow. So we'd have blue and yellow for the touch buttons. Yeah. Mm yeah. Okay hang on. See if it's there. I don't know. Hang on. Interface concepts  no? Either refresh it  or it sh Oh wait  maybe I didn't put it there. Hang on. Sorry  hang on. Don't know. Okay. Okay  um looking at the interface concept  it's gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this. Uh if you wanna start the next slide. Um uh can't really see  but there's two possible ways  on the r left  if you see on th on the sides of of the remote  you have the sort of scroll down  so you have that option right there. And then also there's the idea of the base. That's sort of like an idea there. And then on the right  we have what's really big trend right now  it's the iPod. It's becoming really and so you have this sort of very very simplistic menu section uh with the round buttons  and it's sort of like you have the both kind of trendy and hip  but also very sleek and um and very simple  but technologically advanced. So if you wanted to do that th if we could find a way of sort of like using that idea in a remote control then sort of look into it  but Anyway  next. Um there's the idea of like being able to do it by feel as well as by um by sight. You'd you know you're in the dark  you don't wanna be looking at the remote control. And the picture particularly is pointing out if you look at the top volume button it's a V_  and so yo you're kind of feeling a V_ like volume up. What it really is is a V_ and what it you think it is is down  because the down arrow. And so it's like a sort of a criticism you'd probably turn that o the other way up. Um but then you have you could either do it by raised type  which could be you know  iffy  um sort of old-fashioned in a way. Either that or just have it by shape  for example you have a specific triangular shape that you know you're looking at the up and down arrow. And then the round ones you sort of feel by  you know  that's the second one down  that sort of thing. So it's sort of looking into how we wanted t to do it by feel. Okay. Um this is sort of an example of going for a s certain demographic. Um this is particularly geared towards children. Um it's very cute  and we could probably change it to yellow  bright yellow for like a the for the company logo. Um and you have the shapes and it's very simplistic and friendly looking. Um and then the other thing that it would be able to do is just to pro be ab you program certain channels that only these children would watch  so it's like they ch watch  you know  the C_ Beebies or something like that  uh keep them away from other channels. So that's like another ar Um  I mean  these are three examples sort of looking at it. You have the wider section for the main controls there. Uh you could see how many buttons there are. And then on the left you have an example of the round buttons  and a simpler design. On the bottom we probably wouldn't need that  because it's more for like a D_V_D_ function which we are not gonna be using. Um. So again it's sort of like just give you ideas and then down at the bottom you have the logos and that's where you could put the R_R_  Real Reaction. And then finally these are like the sort of same examples  but also some more  just possibilities that we could go with. None of them I'm particularly keen on by the way. But it's sort of like just taking aspects out of that and saying  well out of this one we like  you know the round section of um  b or we'd like the the button size on this. Right. That's it. Right. Let me just add one more thing that I couldn't say before  and that's just that there's the new technology that they've developed on the voice recognition. Um. Right except that it's sort of odd  and I'm no not exactly sure why they are explaining it in the way they are  um there's a sample sensor and there's a sample speaker unit for So  you would say like  good morning  coffeemaker  and it would respond  good morning  Jill  but I'm not sure exactly how it's gonna work  'cause do you programme do we program the responses and the questions. So does that mean that the user then has to ask the specific question  and can't change it in order for it to be recognised  or can it be altered in a certain way  or does the actually user program it  to say a channel means this. Right  so it's got like a limited memory and programme it. So it's sort of iffy  but that's kind of what you'd say. I always feel like first I wanna know what it looks like  before 'Cause if it's something really really small  then it's sort of harder to imagine a base for it  that was p quite a s substantial size sort of standing up Right. Well  the other thing is like even if it's got a few buttons  so we want it to be bigger than this  'cause it still fits in your hand  so you still wanted something that's comfortable and substantial  but not necessarily full of buttons. Are you gonna lose it easier? Yeah. So i That's the other thing  it's like You know Are we gonna have certain chips that are gonna require bigger size period? But like  you know  if we get more complicated then it's gonna v be have to be bigger to just accommodate the chip size. So we sh Yeah. I'm a away from the base. Yeah. Smaller and smaller  yeah  yeah  yeah. You're kidding. Oh watches I've but I've never washed a cell phone. Well  titanium s I was saying that titanium  if we're being restricted then I would probably lean away from that. Yeah. That'll Yeah  exactly. The selling point  yeah. Are we restricted by this? Twenty five Euros So you're talking about like when it leaves our salesroom then it's all gonna be cherry-coloured or is it gonna be the kinda thing where people come back and swap it? Okay. The what the top face  right? Yeah. A tracker  yeah. Well  my little sister got for Christmas she got one of those key finders that's like a key-ring  and you have to whistle in a certain frequency for it to work. And then she would laugh and it would start going off in her purse  and you couldn't turn it off. So it became highly irritating. But then it Hmm. Okay. Well  that depends on what the energy is needed. As long as we sell it with it. Right  that's what I meant. What's it gonna Yeah  what's it gonna look like. Um. Well  my issue with that is if it got too big though  'cause if you have the circle and the button in the middle  then is it gonna get wider than your your hands are  because w And then would the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it? Yeah. But is that for Which? Do we have both sides? Well  the other option is in instead of a scroll you just have the buttons up on the side which are on the side. Um what colour? Well I sort of like having the a yellow strip at the bottom with the R_R_ like that. And that's at the bottom of it. Which button? Yeah. Yeah. I'm just really wary of the putting anything on a button. What's the button Well  w w then what's the button do  and how do you know that that is what the button does? I guess. Just looking at examples  y you just don't ever see the logo on a button  it's always on the actual casing. But you don't But uh  yeah  you don't see it. Well  hang on. The other option is  I don't know if you can see it but it's like if Yeah  it's like the second to last slide. Interface  yeah. Yeah. Um. Okay  it's the very right one. You see at the bottom  it's kind of difficult to see  but you have like a d sort of s division between the bottom like  where the logo is  and if we have the replaceable section  it's like the top. It doesn't necessarily replace the entire top. And so you have that one piece that stays and the rest just sort of clips in. If c you envisioning it? And so that stays the same when you have the logo  and then you have this s slip that kinda clips in and that's the bit that changes. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah  yeah. Right. That's like  you know  a a cellphone it's like the the screen is always just left opened. And so  what we are gonna do it like bright yellow with the R_R_? Yellow. Yeah. Oh  that one. Um. Ha hang on Let me catch up. Did we finalise what buttons we're including or we just everything that we said before? Yeah. Fun. Okay. Hi Team. Hope you had a good lunch. Okay we're back for the conceptual design meeting. Um let's get started. 'Kay  here is the agenda for today's meeting. Um we're gonna open it and I'm gonna keep the minutes as Project Manager. We're gonna have three presentations  one from each of you again. And then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close it up. And we have forty minutes again. 'Kay  and just to reiterate um after this meeting the team will reach a decision on the concepts of the remote control. Okay. Let's go ahead and start off with your presentations. Who would like to go first? Okay. Um Courtney would you mind starting us off? Okay. Trend watching? 'Kay. Mm 'kay. Mm. Mm. Right. Yes. Right. Right. People don't buy a new remote every so often. Okay. Hmm. Very good. I like it. Okay  ready for the next slide? Op mm 'kay. Great. Great presentation. Ready? 'Kay. Which one is it? Interface concepts new. Y 'Kay. Sorry? Oh okay. Oh there we go. Sure. Mm 'kay. Mm. Mm. Okay. Okay. 'Kay. No. Mm. Or I like  you know  the black finish or the silver finish or whatever. Good lord. Okay. Ready? Oh  yeah. Okay. Great job. Okay. What's the title? Got it. Hmm. Interesting. Mm. 'Kay. No  okay. Mm. Hmm. Okay. Alright  well thank you for those informative presentations. Let's go back to um Now we have to make some decisions. Where were we? Sure. Mm. Right. Right. Mm. Hmm. Programme. If it's within our price to get that kind of chip that would  you know  technology Hmm. Mm. Hmm. Okay  that kind of brings us to this  let's let's see if we can decide what kind of energy source we want to have first and foremost. Um. Do we wanna go for batteries or a stand like the one that we saw illustrated earlier? The base  the charging base with rechargeable batteries? Hmm. Yeah  and we don't have multiple things that it has to control  it just has to control the T_V_. It's not gonna be a huge universal remote. What size battery and Right. I agree  it's either gonna be bigger with a base or smaller with just A battery like this guy. Alright  so what direction do you want to go in? You wanna vote? I'm kind of I'm kind of leaning in the direction of this kind of bigger and the base. That just seems so clunky and Okay. Hmm. Okay  so what kind of material do we want to be made out of? No. Oh what did you Oh sorry  go ahead. Right. What would you recommend? Mm. I I think we should just focus on one design and one concept right now.I'm not sure that we'll have the time and money to produce a whole array of remotes. If this was a successful remote  we might then produce a higher end version of it  I think. Okay  so we wanna go for plastic  or what would you recommend for materials? Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Okay. They could buy cases  maybe  if they wanted. I think it's good to sell a basic thing and then sell options. Okay. Okay. Right. Right. Okay  and what kind of chip would we need for this guy? I don't think we should do voice  I think we should just do um the recognition for when it's lost  you know. could we Yeah. Hmm. Right. Oh dear. Okay. Okay. Alright. But it's not gonna be voice activated in the fact that you would say  channel up  and it would work  right? Just a Okay  alright. No. Mm 'kay. Uh and what size batteries  double A_  triple A_? Two? Could it run off of two They're more expensive though  too. Mm. Thoughts anybody? Okay. Yeah. Alright. Okay. So we've covered that first category  User Interface Concept  meaning design. Okay. I ki I kind of like your idea about the retro phone dial  and that the central button could have  maybe our logo on it? It might be the four way scroll  too. I mean if Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. Oh  I see what you mean. I think so. Yeah  I like that. 'Kay. Mm. Can we? So that you're just not holding it and it changes the chan Mm. Yeah. Hmm. 'Kay any other ideas? Oh  yeah. Latex covers. W I think maybe we should do it on a b button itself though  because if people are able to change the covers  I don't know  maybe the on-off button  something  some the menu button  I don't know  but you know if we're gonna put our company logo on there and somebody could just get another one. Are they all gonna have our company logo on them? Every cover? Yeah. If we want it to be visible and Um are all those those one that you showed where they were um s met silver-metallic looking? But those are plastic  right? They're not titanium. I kind of like that look. Uh but  or if it was really Yeah  for the base or if we're going for the retro look  I think  like a really shiny black would be cool. What are your thoughts? Gun-metal gray. There you go  gun-metal gray. Why? Mm. Right. On the back? It d visible Visibility though 'Cause if it was only on the back really the only time you're gonna see it is when you drop it or when you're changing the battery. I can find it again. Okay. And yours was called Interface Concept? This one? Well  for some reason I can't get it to just go to that slide directly. Mm. Okay  yes yes. Okay. Like a little cut-out kind of Okay. Anybody see anything that they liked in these ones? Mm. Mm. Yellow  I like that idea. Mm. Mm. I like the yellow illumination idea  very good. Okay. Any other ideas or thoughts? We all seem to be fairly in agreement about what we wanna do with this project so 'Kay. I think there will be time for that later. I'm guessing. 'Kay  well we're gonna wrap this up. Um next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes  and here's what we're each of us going to do. The I_D_ is going to do the look and feel design  the U_I_D_ the user interface design. I think you're going to get a lot of  I mean  the final say on what buttons get put We'll all talk about it  but I think  that's pretty much what you're gonna do  right? I guess. 'Kay. And you're gonna do some product evaluation. Okay  and right now  the I_D_ and U_I_D_  you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay. Yeah. Okay  and you should all be getting an email pretty soon. Alright. Well  thank you for a very productive meeting. ,The Project Manager introduced the project to the group. The group set an agenda for the meeting and discussed the materials sent to them by the Account Manager. They discussed and explained their roles in the project. The group began a discussion about their initial ideas for the product. They discussed several usability features: adding speech recognition and an option to choose what to watch by channel or by content  reducing the number of buttons by using the television screen to display options  and adding a light adaptation system. All participants were instructed to gather more information for the next meeting  the functional design meeting. 
Right w welcome to the the first meeting of uh Real Reaction's uh um development meetings for our our new television remote control. Uh this follows our very successful entry into the the consumer market over the last year or so um which we want to to build on  taking advantage of the uh the the latest developments in in technology and the uh the latest uh uh feelings in in consumer design and and demand and uh we want to make this the the very best product th that's possible for everybody  uh one that everybody wants  uh at a good price for the consumer and at a good price for the company. Uh and to that end we need all to work together uh to do that. Um and uh b in no particular order because ev everybody is uh just as vital to this project um I'll just go round th the table  Andrew  marketing  um m Kendra with the uh um designing the the the User Interface uh uh and Kate with the the industrial design. Um. What's uh the the th th project is is here to do  is is to to get this this project up and moving  ev everybody is is free to uh say wh whatever they want  uh everybody has a contribution to make and uh everybody feel free to interrupt me at any time to to say what you want to say. Um in in terms of the immediate meeting the uh um everybody knows everybody else  everybody's worked for the the company for a while  if if an anybody feels that they need to say more about themselves please do  if if if anybody wants to b briefly give their their background so that everybody's quite clear what everybody uh uh everybody's experience is please do so. Uh in fact I'd I'd I'd welcome anybody to uh say something briefly about themselves  in fact we will do that by by going round the table quickly and and saying what what contribution you you're looking to make. So we'll start with Andrew. Right Kendra. Right at least means you haven't got any preconceived ideas so. Yep  good. Okay  very very quickly  um this I don't want to make this meeting too structured because the the whole idea is that it's a um you know a think tank. Everybody says what they what they want to say  uh and we don't want to be constrained by uh kind of convention or uh uh slides on screens or or anything else um but um briefly um th th this is what we want to do. The the remote control needs to be original  there has to be something about it that uh other remote controls don't have so that as soon as people see it they think um yes that's different  uh I want one  um and that goes along with being trendy  uh uh you know the I want it uh scenario. User-friendly as as we all know  remote controls can be uh uh very user-unfriendly so we want to make ours one that people can pick up and think oh yes that's it's obvious how that works  uh and they also want to look at the price and think oh yeah that's something that I may not need another remote control but uh it's such a nice one I'm gonna have one. And last but not least  or indeed first of all  it it must make the company money  and we make the company money by producing what the consumer wants. The uh the further work to be done is i the um the functional design  uh what it uh what it must actually do  the uh conceptual design  uh how we actually present that to the consumer and th the the detailed design i is uh how we get that into production. Uh now th the main design tool that we have available to us at the moment is is the white board and uh uh let us very quickly do what i what it says in the in the in the prompt slide here  um In fact I suggest to avoid everybody untangling themselves from the uh the the wires  that we don't do that  um So I I everybody knows what whiteboard is so we'll um uh we'll do a virtual drawing on the on on the whiteboard of of your your own uh uh favourite animal  but le let's go round the table  your favourite animal. Mm and why? Uh-huh. Oh right uh my my wife says my beard looks like a badger's arse 'cause of the the white streaks in it. Kendra. Uh-huh. Right  okay. Uh-huh  fair enough yeah. I'm not sure that I've got any favourite animal to be quite honest  I think homo sapien because of their their uh overall ability to uh uh Sorry? Indeed absolutely yes  tha that's um Okay and uh w we need to keep in mind here that the uh we want to sell this for for twenty five Euro um  we want to m make an overall profit for the the company of fifty million Euros so we're we're looking at selling a lot of these um ag across the the entire planet and and we're looking at a gross profit of fifty percent. It needs to cost twelve Euros fifty to make. Um so we're not only looking at a a very trendy original product  we're looking at making it at a very good price. Um  okay  um would anybody like t like to to start by giving their o um sort of quick views of of current remote controls. No. Any any thoughts about buttons or any oth other way of approaching the p the uh the problem? Or anybody else  strong feelings about remote controls? Are there you know  bad ones they've used or good ones they've used or ones that they've lost and never found again? Um what so wh what's in in what particular style features are you thinking about? Uh-huh.. Yeah d no I mean do you think there's a risk if it doesn't look like remote control  people won't see it as a remote control um and uh Uh-huh. Any other thoughts about um th the physical appearance of a of remote controls? I mean th the thing that i immediately comes to mind is computer mouses which um I mean y you get all sorts of shapes in the shops and s you know some quite fancy ones um than the some from personal experience which look nice but aren't particularly comfortable. Um any thoughts about buttons or flat screens or uh uh Yes  I mean the only thing is if if you're watching television in a in a a darkened room um you need to be able to uh fi find the button buttons easily. Yeah  that's uh must admit I don't think I've ever seen one with concave buttons  that's uh certainly be different. Um do we need it to uh I can't think of any re remote controls that I know of that actually light up at all. Do we do we want uh Yeah. Okay. So  Andrew have you had any thoughts yet about how we might market something which there are already millions out there and that we want to uh uh uh t take over the entire um the planet with? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay  yeah  yeah  well I d I think an any uh any facets that we identify w we aim need to aim for for all of. Um okay well first thoughts on um the the industrial design side. Indeed. Yeah. Okay  and um colours  materials? Kendra  anyone?. Yeah. Uh-huh. Right. Yeah. Okay that's uh Again I don't think that's ever been done before  it's uh the sort of the sort of thing that would get people uh thinking yes that's something that I haven't got and uh might need so. Uh Andrew  any thoughts about uh how we might market interchangeable fronts on on the remote control? Yeah. Yeah. I think Mm-mm. Right  okay I think we've got um a good idea now. We uh meeting is uh Needs to be k uh wrapped up fairly quickly. So uh um we've got thirty minutes to start looking at the um at the design in more detail. Um then we'll we will reconvene in in thirty minutes and try to get some of these ideas uh uh more formalised. Uh thank you very much indeed. Uh I'm Katie  I'm the Industrial Designer and I'll just be I guess presenting about the the inter workings of our little remote control and uh yeah. Uh 's horses  no particular reason why. Um I think it's important that you should be able to when you when you press the buttons it'll actually pick up the signals from kind of anywhere and you shouldn't have to like contort yourself and twist your remote control to get it the T_V_ to actually pick up the signal. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm that would be good. Mm. Mm. Mm. Oh I think it's it's remote controls are kind of a unique object 'cause it's you depend on them so much  but you don't i i it's you sort of just assume they're always gonna work  you don't think of them as a comp like a computer can break down and you're kinda like oh well fair enough there's all these complex things going on  it's gonna something's gonna get messed up eventually. They they just need to be very very dependable because people sort of take them for granted and then if your remote control breaks it's God forbid you actually get up and manually change the channel it just it needs to be very effective  very always dependable. Uh I don't think we should make it too small I 'cause I think it needs to it can't be too big like you were saying big an and huge and um awkward  but also if you make it too small kinda like you know how mobile phones are getting smaller and smaller um  it's just gonna end up under a couch cushion somewhere and um yeah. But so yes dependable  and have a good medium range size. Mm  mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Well you could come up with like novelty ones  like they've done with the the mobile phones  you can get like different you know scenes from different movies and stuff on the remote control and sorta stagger the release of them and get people like oh I want that cover on it now and that'll keep them spending money. Thank you. I'm Kendra and I'm the Us User Interface Designer and um I haven't had a whole lot of experience in this kind of thing before but I'm m so I'll be working on the design. Right. Yep  I'm just open to being creative. Um probably a duck I just I li I like the way they look and they're just nice animals and I like how they can fly or swim or walk around or whatever. Well I think I find a lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons and uh it's handiest when you have one that works both the D_V_D_ player or whatever and the T_V_ as well. Um  but that it's easy to if you can switch back and forth instead of having to press a bunch of different buttons and so I think it's is best when they're clearly labelled and you can see which buttons you're supposed to use  you know. Yeah. I think something that's comfortable to hold because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big  rectangular things and uh they're kind of awkward to hold onto  so something that's more comfortable that fits in a person's hand better. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them be kind of down so you could feel them better. Oh yeah. Like a like a mobile phone? Yeah. Well  most I think most of the remote controls now are either just black or grey  so maybe we should go with something different or be able to I was just thinking of um what they're doing with mobile phones now how you can get the different um what are they called? Like the face-plates that you change so we could have maybe I don't know if it would be feasible to do something with that  where you can change the face-plates or have kind of a variety so people can get different different things. Have it kind of look how they want to  different colours  things like that  probably just plastic because that's always the lightest. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Mm. Oh my name's Andrew I'm a I'm the Market Research person for this uh for this meeting and this uh project for creating this new remote control and uh yeah I'll be uh presenting information statistics on what people want to want to uh get from this new design  what people want to like and from a fashion point of view and the practicality point of view. Um  badger. Uh it's it's got nice contrast with black and white and uh I feel they're underdog kind of status and they're  the Make mobile phones and T_V_ remotes to make T_V_ remotes. Yeah. Think a lot of the time  remotes that come with T_V_ players and T_V_s and D_V_ players  like they aren't like an area that's put a lot of effort into  they're very boring  very plain. Like it's very a very like um making a a stylish remote control would be a very like Easily put us one step ahead of the current competition. Um. Something that looks looks doesn't look like remote control. So if you want  something that looks like uh something that makes you think oh what's this? Like this pen doesn't really look like a pen  but it makes you think oh. So  sorry that's a bit vague. Uh I suppose suppose that's up to the marketing to to make make people aware of the product. Mm. Yeah. Well from the mouse idea you could  remote is a piece of plastic with the big rubber buttons sticking out of it which you press  whereas if you want could all be flat and the buttons are very kind of almost subtle that instead of being raised out of the device uh you push into device you see  like a mouse button. I suppose. Easily  yeah yeah. Mm. Mm  yeah that would be good. Mm-hmm  um especially if we try to sell  what two million of them. Oh sorry  four million of 'em  but uh I think if w if we market it as as not as not well this you c you could either market it as the point of view we could have the two we could have parallel marketing s schemes where you've got one where it appeals to people that want to have the new device that looks cool  is fashionable and like you just it's it's like uh it's one that rather than ra I wan I want rather than a kind of a need relationship with the device  but that might considering the act what the device is for and the nature of some people might not like respond to having a device that they just looks nice  therefore they want it so make it practical at the same time. I think it's this is gonna have to appeal to people that want device that can enhance their living room uh but also a device that uh is practically sound. So um  I dunno we'll have to decide which which angle we're gonna go to or both. If you. Mm. Um  well we could either market it together by getting control in a set colour or with like you buy it with several uh like you ge you get the f uh the face-plates with it when you buy or as a separate thing  but uh maybe thinking of that  it's considering the nature of the device  maybe a second thing like a second campaign to market new facials for your to your might go a bit astray since it is the kind of thing where y you generally get one and then forget about it. Unless you were trying to Mm. Oh it's that's a that's a good idea. Mm. Yeah true.. ,The Industrial Designer presented an overview of the internal components of a remote control device. He discussed energy source and material options  and suggested that using rubber and plastic would be the most versatile option. He displayed the three options for chips. The User Interface Designer discussed voice recognition with the group  and the group decided to not use it in their design. He suggested using rubber buttons because of their durability. He discussed the size of the device and the layout of the interface  and suggested that the remote be moderately sized to prevent its getting lost. The Marketing Expert expressed concern that the remote lacked enough features to be distinctive. The group had a discussion to decide on the product features. They decided to include a charging stand  to use a thin rubber casing material  to include a locator function and a scroll wheel with two channel-changing options to increase its usability. The group discussed the cost of the various components and decided to sell the device at a point between thirty-five and fifty Euros. The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer were instructed to construct the prototype. 
Okay uh Agnes  you can help me for the slide when okay. Okay  welcome back. I hope uh you have a fresh head and a fresh time. How t now the meeting actually we gathering here to discuss about the functional design meeting. Okay  and uh we'll issue some information from uh all of you. And it's in the  I think uh  in the sharing folder. And uh I will invite uh the Christine and the Ed and uh Agnes to discuss about on the various subjects. So can you go to the next slide? Yeah uh the agenda of the meeting is opening. Then uh I'm going to talk about uh the project management  what I'm going to do  and uh  of course  I'm doing the project management and secretary both  okay  to take the minutes of the meeting. And there are three presentations. One is uh new project requirements. And the second one about uh decision on remote control functions. And uh finally we are closing. Uh and the meeting time will be uh forty minutes  so you have to be very quick. And I have come up with the management come with the new proposal  okay  and I have to discuss a few points on this. Uh both says new insights in the aim of your project. Uh the one is uh the teletext becomes uh outmoded  okay because if uh because of the computer systems and the new technology. So we don't need to consider really about the teletext all in our new project design. And the second one is about uh the remote control. Should be used only for the T_V_. That's what our uh management says. And the third point  it's very very important to establish our uh marketing or uh corporate image  okay  with this new project or new product. Okay. So I will invite uh Agnes  can you go to the third slide? Okay . So  I'll invite uh Christine to discuss about uh the functional design. Yeah  let me uh interrupt you uh if you can add other facility  other feature  like uh unbreakable. Okay  because uh especially today  you know  you have the family and the kids  okay  and the kids throw it and they they play with their remotes and. Yes. Okay  so if you can add the feature  okay  for your uh fabric whatever in your outline design okay  with unbreakable  okay  I think that will give a lot of advantage for our product  if I'm not wrong. Maybe you can uh add it in that. Okay  uh thank you Christine  and uh uh any questions or uh clarifications  or any discussion on the functional design? Yes. Yeah so Yeah the the I'm sorry because uh the last meeting we supposed to discuss about the financial thing. Uh let me go quickly  maybe if I can go back. I know the project plan and the budget. So I can close this  not sure. Was in uh S This. So let me see where is this file. This is Christine. That's yours  okay. Saving. Okay  uh I will I will send you a mail  okay? The project may be the the project aim  okay. At the end of the day  the company uh wants to make at least uh the fifty million Euro. Okay  and uh of course the price will be very reasonable on the the sales side. Okay  that maybe Eddie will talk to you about uh how much uh the price and uh what's uh how much its cost for the manufacturing and how much it's going to be we sell in the market. Okay. Then uh you can come back with your feedback. And I I have one maybe the suggestion or opinion. This remote control  okay  it can be for like universal  to use for any T_V_. Okay  and it will be slim  okay  and uh Not fat. Okay. Yep. But let's try it  okay  with the different uh the designs  okay  the functional designs. Okay? So any other questions? Okay. Thank you Christine for uh time being  so then uh Ed  so can you tell about Mm-hmm. Yep. Yep. Mm-hmm. Yep. So what do you think about uh the design? Do you think you can make it or uh What do you think about uh the design  uh what he was talking about of the speech recognition? Mm-hmm. Yep. Well  what I can uh suggest to you  Christine  okay  uh if you need some uh the technical feedback  or some training  okay  about uh this facility  especially for the speech recognition  I can recommend you some companies like uh Intel or I_B_M_  okay  because they're already in this uh speech recognition part  okay. And uh you can maybe have some uh technical backup from them  some kind of a technical tie-up. Okay  and uh if you want  I can coordinate  okay  to get some information  okay  and uh you can uh let me know  okay  so what kind of uh the details you require okay  to add this feature in this project. I don't think it's uh the difficult. And uh we need to know how much is the timeframe you need to develop  apart from uh what today. Yep. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yep. Yeah but but end of the day  you're the sales guy  so I will come back and sit on your head because uh you are going to give your sales projection  okay. It's uh of course it's uh good to uh tell the management how much it's cost us and how much you are going to benefit  okay. And uh  so I don't mind to convince  okay  the management to spend some more money on the project  okay  if you can make out of the money from this project. Yes  okay I don't mind to convince the the management  okay. The management says  okay  so they they don't want certain facilities  which it's already worked  okay  they want something uh new  okay. I think uh like uh speech recognit definitely they will agree  I don't think they'll say no for that  okay. And uh I hope I can convince the management on that  okay. So if you have any uh new ideas  okay  for uh your you can always come up and uh you can tell me if you need any uh s special  okay  coordination  okay  between any uh technical companies  which you can uh hide their technology backup  okay  for your uh functional design or technical design  okay  then I am ready to do that. And uh what's your comments about uh Yeah  so you are finish  Ed  uh so I can uh Okay  I'll uh hand over to Agnes. Just gonna close this. T Uh where are you  here? Participant three. Okay  so I'll yep. Okay. Is it okay? Alri Click mm. So for anybody need uh any help  for time being  on this uh subjects  okay  so please come back to me  and uh Christine  maybe I can uh try to help you to get some uh the technical uh the companies to help you for uh make a design uh slim  okay  and to add some features  like we are talking about  the speech recognition and all. Yeah. So not really this one we are talk ab Yep. Okay  that will be great. And uh I'll send you the the minutes of meet Yeah. Okay  what we'll do is now we'll take for lunch break  okay  then uh we can discuss furthermore  okay  with our areas  and uh then we will come back again in the in the next meeting. So thanks for coming and uh I'll send you minutes of meeting  and uh please put your all information in the sharing folder so everybody can share the information. Okay? So let's go for lunch then. Thank you. Fantastic. Titanium. Expensive. I don't know  I think verbally we can we can pretty much sell. Hmm. Uh from her side  I don't think uh there's too many more questions. If you can come to the Okay  from the marketing yeah  from the marketing side  just to to give an idea what the management is looking for  I was looking for a a remote control to have a s I have a sales price of twenty-five Euro  with a production price of uh twelve and a half Euro. For what uh I think from what we're trying to find  we're tr we're looking for  I don't think that price is exactly in the market. Okay? I'll explain myself here now in the sense that uh in a in the recent surveys  uh from the ages fr from fifteen to thirty-five  eighty percent are willing to spend more money for something as fancy as trendy. Twenty-five Euros  uh that's that's a preson reasonable price. That's a market price right now. Now if we're gonna take a risk  and push this up a bit  make it more expensive  but give them added things that they don't have now  then it w it could possibly sell. Obviously the risk is there. Too expensive  they're not gonna buy. But  I think uh there's one other thing interesting two things that are interesting is that uh from the fifteen to thirty-five year-old group  which always spends more money on trendy new things  speech recognition is requested. And we're talking between seventy-five to ninety percent of this group is willing to pay for speech recognition on a remote. Obviously  we can't make a remote into a computer  but maybe simple commands. I dunno  louder  softer  on  off. That might be a possibility  even though it costs more  to be the first on the market to produce this. Thirty-five percent say they're too difficult to use. So we have to figure out a way of making it um more user friendly. Uh fifty percent say they can't find the remote half the time. So maybe one word speech recognition commands  say remote  and there's a beep beep beep  and they can find it through  you know  ten tons of newspapers  magazines  whatever you have at home. But  in the cost that uh the management is looking for  that's not gonna be possible. But if it's trendy  if it's fancy  it's got some colour to it  if it's very easy easy to use  if it's got simple remote speech remote uh control  like I said  louder  softer  change channel  on  off  remote  it goes beep beep  I can find my my remote without spending half a day looking for it and getting all upset 'cause I can't turn the T_V_ on. So we're gonna have to look at it in a in this global idea  with the ideas of the industrial uh design. But  price obviously we have to talk about. Speech recognition. Mm. Because tha w with speech recognition uh th I'm not that good at that idea but th if it's a one-word recognition  'cause I know with telephones and cars and things I've seen in the States  a friend of mine says call Mom  and it calls up Mom. 'Kay the radio can be on and everything. Because I think s with speech recognition  if uh the the remote or like the telephone it has a exact word that it has to hear. I don't think it would come through a sentence in a television. If somebody's speaking on the se the television  they're not gonna stop and say remote  okay. So I think that uh something could be designed to recognise single word Like the t like the telephone. No because I this is this is years ago in the United States where we're driving down and he said call home  and the telephone called immediately so well  that's kinda cute. From from your side uh  you're gonna have to go back the management and s be more s precise. What do they want? Uh  a risk  take a risk on the market? Something that's gonna cost more  but could very easily s make a boom in the market? Because it has to be something totally different  has to be total totally new. Something that nobody has right now. And it's gonna cost. Mm-hmm. Sure. Sure. Obviously. If the bottom line is positive. Mm. Mm. Yes. Mm. Hmm. Individual actions. She's objecting. Oh th we s we still have Yeah. Right. Agreed. Yep. Sure. No  this is the third slide. Sure. Um. You're participant s Two? Do you want the mouse  or do you want me to Mm-hmm. Do you have any preconceived ideas in terms of materials? 'Cause  for example  in the unbreakable thing  doing something plastic would be harder  whereas having something like  I dunno  steel or titanium isn't really economically viable. Yeah. Yeah. Sure  yeah. No  I just wondering whether that you had any sort of Yeah. The marketing comes out. That's Christine's. And that's mine  I think. In modified. S 'scuse me for one sec. Hmm. It seems also like with the speech recognition  yeah  it's a great feature  but if you're watching T_V_  there's a lot of ambient sound  and it's words. It's not just  you know  noises like something hitting. It's actual speech  so then you have to make sure that the speech recognizer is good enough to filter out the T_V_ speech  and the the user's speech. Otherwise  you can say remote. But if someone on the screen is saying the same thing  all of a sudden  you have someone in a movie saying off and your screen dies  because they've triggered the remote control and it's turned off your T_V_. So  I think if we can find a speech recognizer that can handle those types of problems  then yeah  it'd be a really good marketing gimmick. But  I think we seriously need to consider how that would impact the situation. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Oh yeah. Yeah. No  I think it's a great idea if we can design it to to suit those requirements. Yeah. Um well  I mean  maybe if I go through my presentation  you can sort of see what the user perspective is  and how it ties into the other two comments. Mm participant three. Nope  here Good. Thanks. Yeah  and that's fine. Okay. So  basically  the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like and what people don't like about existing products. So  in our case  existing remote controls. And then  what the good ideas are  and what the bad ideas are  and why they're bad and good  which isn't always as obvious. We seem to have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad  but when you look  technically  at how it works  sometimes that's not the case. Then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep  'cause that'll feed into both Ed's work and Christine's work. Um and then what the remote control should look like  obviously  once we've got a good idea of what the functionalities are. So  in terms of the functionalities that we need  you obviously need to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off. You need to change channels  both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing. You need to be able to control the volume and then control any menus on the T_V_ to regulate contrast or whatever. So  the problems that people have expressed is that there's too many buttons on remote controls  in general. The buttons it's not clear what they're supposed to do. Um often  you need to know specific button sequences to get certain functionalities done  um which you don't necessarily always remember  especially if it's a functionality that you don't use very often. And that the buttons are too small. So  here we've got two examples where here on the left-hand side  you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons. The buttons  in a lot of cases  are tiny. Um they're hard to see  and okay  they're labelled  but the labels don't necessarily tell you too much. Whereas  on the other side  you have a much simpler remote control that I think basically has the minimum functionalities that are needed. And it sort of looks simpler and just less imposing when you first look at it. So  I would be inclined to go sort of towards this  in terms of design  rather than this. And if there's specific functionalities that require more buttons  then we can figure out how to do it with existing um buttons. So my personal preferences are to keep the number of buttons to a limit  or to a minimum  sorry  make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed  so like the on button being really obvious one  the channel changing and the volume  and to keep the design basically sleek and simple. Which  I think ties into what Christine and Ed have both said fairly reasonably. Um so  that's pretty much it  an I don't know if you guys have any questions or Yep. Yes  that's true. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Oh  that's definitely a very important factor  especially to users who are gonna be buying the thing and then using it almost on an daily basis in a lot of cases  I think. Oh Should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include  'cause we've thrown a lot of features onto the table  but do we actually want to incorporate all of them  or have we missed anything? Sure. Mm-hmm. I thought No  I I'm just thinking in terms of time  like if Yes  now I'm objecting. No  I mean  I was just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features that we're just gonna end up throwing away? I mean  it takes a lot of time and effort for everyone to consider different features  um and s if we spend that time and effort on features that we're not gonna use  maybe it's better to spend it on the f thinking more about features that we actually do want  but I guess Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Okay. 'Kay  do you wanna open the I'm number two. That's it. I'll do the notes. Yeah  thanks. So um well I I figured uh we should um identify some user requirements  and from my experience  I wanna uh  and from research I did  uh the the device has to turn the television on and off the first time you press on the big button  you can't uh can't have like uh waffling on this point  you know. Really have It needs to be able y y have to be able to find it. Because one of the biggest problems with remote controls is finding them. So uh  I also  since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product  thought we better look at things that are popular and um ex go beyond those  and  as I said in the first meeting  um and then uh we might wanna talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in uh in the construction  especially in the the uh the outside of the product so that it gives the appearance  and it is reliable  and so forth. I did a little history on uh the the uh remote controls and when they were invented and so forth  so  I guess this guy Zenith uh created the Flashmatic  which I kinda like the idea  'cause it made me think of um um maybe the remote control made a big flash when uh you turn the T_V_ on and off  that might be interesting. And um so it was highly directional flash light that uh you could turn the picture on and off  and the sound on and off  and change channels c so I think um those are still requirements we have today  uh fifty years later. And uh it was really a pioneering innovation  but it was uh sensitive to the sun  so that uh it would get would start off by the you'd get it would easily cause um problems. So  uh I in addition to uh looking at the um uh the functional requir so all these devices are examples of where uh mm they represent examples that are available today which I think the one in the middle is r um really uh something to keep in mind. It'd be easy to find. And um it would uh y you'd you could throw it at things if if the T_V_ didn't turn on and off  you could use it for something else. And since I'm not really um Industrial Designer  I didn't really know what to do with this slide. But um I just took some different uh schematics and I put them into this  and I guess this is what a slide might look like if you were drawing a circuit board. I don't know why um we were asked to do this. So  uh personal preferences  um I think we could uh I I'm really thinking outside the box here  and I think that we should consider perhaps having an an an a a size uh a remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference. So something that's very very flexible and inflatable and then you could shrink it. I think um it could either be you could go either one extreme  be very colourful  or you could make it clear  and um kind of blend in with things  so you didn't have to um uh have a problem with the th the decoration of the of the user's home. Um I think uh it needs to be waterproof  because uh sometimes they fall into cups and  you know  it might be out by the swimming pool or something like that. Um if you uh mi one of one of my requirements was about needs t to tell you when it's done its job or not  because half the time  I keep pushing on the remote control  and I don't know if it's actually understood my message  so I think it should give you some sort of an oral cue. And uh  course I never wanna replace the battery. So  that's those are my f preferences  and that's my presentation. Yes. Run over it with a car. Good idea. Good idea  I'll I'll uh um Yes  very good. Hmm. Titanium. Titanium would be be heavy  too  wouldn't it? No  I haven't really um I wanted feedback  I think we need to rate rank these  but we'll see what your uh personal preferences are and your thoughts. I like titanium. It's light. Uh yeah but uh who who said who said we were  you know  nobody told me how mu what our financial objective is  so um It'd be hard to inflate something ou made out of titanium though. Not fat? Not fat  huh. Might be hard to find  though. Oh  okay. Speech recognition?. D uh I'm sorry? Well  uh training is always an issue with uh commands. So um might uh we can perhaps um do it if the user is willing to spend some time in the training process  uh it could reduce th th uh the overall um cost. Not sure how. But um anyway  um I I think also that uh this might impact the battery life. And um so  maybe what we'll have to do is um add something where you can um recharge it wirelessly so that uh y you know sen send power to it. So uh or maybe uh set it out in the sun and it uh  you know  gets uh  from the light  um a a solar cell inside there so that uh you have enough uh juice to do all these fancy things. Off. Very good point. Okay  we'll find that out. Oh  it's um  seems very understandable. Clearly your research and uh and ours uh heading in the same direction  and um uh the only thing that I saw missing from uh your your research that we found was this uh ability to find the doggone thing when you need it. So uh  you know  but that's okay. That's why we're all here at the table  so that if we think of it and our research indicates certain things and um w we it's complementary. I also think that um uh th f the the feel of it is uh  when you hold it  is something that um uh was expressed more in in in in my uh design and that's logical and normal 'cause those are the parameters that an Industrial Designer's more thinking about  th th the look and the feel  and uh  you're First. Yep. Mm-hmm. Okay  so I don't have any questions. Sounds good. Do you wanna go back and look at the closing slide  maybe that would provide some guidance? Doesn't really tell us. Well it says individual actions  it says user interf so I'm supposed to do the components concept  supposed to work on the user interface concept  and you're supposed to keep watching the trends. Um and specific instructions will be sent by our our coach. I think we should do as many features as uh start with all of them right now and eliminate them later in the process  that's my suggestion. You can object if you want to I think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting  'cause w our meeting time has run out. Somebody else has go to use this room  and  you know  we can't hang out here and talk about this  so Thank you very much. ,The industrial designer gave a presentation on the interface concept  discussing which buttons will be needed and then looking at some examples of existing remote controls. He suggested using a yellow case with rounded edges and the logo at the bottom  and large  clearly marked buttons. The interface expert informed the group that young people like curved shapes  soft materials and primary colours  and suggested making a hand-shaped remote in plastic and rubber. He talked about the possibility of using a scroll button  and the different chips which could be used. The group discussed using an LCD screen  but did not have enough information about costs to make a decision. The marketing expert talked about new trends  including the trends for spongy materials and fruit and vegetable themed products. The group had a discussion and decided to create two designs  one with an LCD screen and one without  and the interface designer drew them on the board. They put off making a final decision about using an LCD screen  scroll buttons and a menu button until they could find out about costs. 
Okay  it's a I think if we both step up and uh outline our ideas. Okay. Now do uh doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design. Um for one thing  it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is um is h i is down here for the uh L_E_D_. As it turned out  the whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly well from the point of view of operating the uh function buttons and joystick  though it might be an idea to be able to a adjust the positions for the base of the joystick just a little bit for uh ju just a thought. You could simply have a slightly ovoid shaped joystick that could then just be turn uh twisted round  so that the uh sticky uh so that the bit that sticks out a bit more is on one side or the other. But as you as you see with the uh with holding it in the left hand  the L_ uh the L_C_D_ is nowhere useful  so that would need to be articulated uh if we're going to retain ergonomic design. Um now I I got your note about uh keeping the cost down. Yeah. this design could be done with um with uh plastic casing. Though I would recommend around the grip part here in the middle  having maybe just a rubber grip over that which would allow for a slightly more sort of bio-morphic form  and a bit more ergonomic as well. As for the um as for the single curve  um well this edge and this edge  like I say it would be nice to have some curvature to it  but it's not absolutely necessary. Really the curve that's most needed is the underside so that the jo so that the joystick rests over the the edge of the hand like this. Um and you have the uh transmitter here and a wee speaker for the uh for the uh for the uh fi uh for the remote control finder. So. Any further comments? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah  I mean the uh Yeah. Yeah. I mean with the with the rubber design it could i you know it could pretty much mould very much to the to the user's hand. One nice wee feature if we could if we could still do the rubber  I though of was to have the uh rubber extend beyond the end of the uh of the rigid substructure. So it has a wee sort of tail that you just drape over your wrist so it stays in position nicely. Mm. Lovely. Um. Okay. Yeah  that's still part of the design. Mm. Mm. And making it a bright colour helps with the personally I would have gone for purple. Mm-hmm. I'd say number one. I think w if it was just the sounder then th I mean something I've found with uh w w with say tr trying to find uh a cordless phone or a m mobile  you can hear it  but you can't quite pin it dow pin down where it is. Bu Yeah. Mm-hmm I suppose o one thing that could be done is h is have it um circular and have it s so that the uh the pink actually goes a bit over the pinkie finger. Mm. So that uh th Mm. Mm. yeah. Mm. Mm. I think if we remove the the L_C_ display then there was absolutely no point to any of these meetings and we just we could just put our branding on any other remote control. Mm-hmm. Um yeah I mean one thing  I mean ho uh how much extra would it be to to keep I mean keep the um the articulation? This is what I'm wondering. Oh no  I think I I it d that it needn't require it to be double curved. It's uh it's just it's just it's just that the case would come in t would be made in two parts and then joined together with an articulation. Mm. Yeah  I mean and I mean the uh I mean if you look uh if you look closer at the uh at the prototype here  the lines here along the grip are actually quite straight. Um I mean yeah  on the on the L_C_D_ I mean although we've done it with a curve it could just as easily be done um without curves. The curve that's really needed is up here  to put uh to keep the joystick in a good ergonomic position for it to have it rest on the top of the hand. Mm. Mm no that's that voice response thing that we got the email about. But I thought it was just completely pointless. Yeah. Alright. B i basically it was saying that our labs had come up with a chip that you could  you know  say hello to  and it would say hello back in a friendly female voice. Mm-hmm. Mm. Okay  well l let's say that and then we can have our special coloured case and then we at least have make it a little harder to lose. Because most m most remotes are a fairly dingy colour that gets camouflaged under any pile of crap in a living room. Or grey. Yellow. Okay. Three. I think we can do three. Th the special colour doesn't would I think make a difference. It makes it stand out from you know it's lost in a big pile of crap  it stands out from the rest of the crap. Two buttons and a joystick. Totally. It doesn't get much fancier. Mm. Mm. I'd give it a three for this for that. Yeah. I mean the menus thing is something you don't normally see on um on a remote  but you see it in a lot of other places. Mm-hmm. I'd give it a three. Mm-hmm. I'd s I I'd give it a six  to be honest. Well I I I would sa I would say give a s give a selection of colours. Um we went with yellow we went with yellow for the prototype 'cause we had yellow. If I were buying one  I'd go for purple. Leopard print would be cool. That's kinda i it won't be when it's been budgeted. I I think s I I think this isn't not particularly fruit and veggie. Um. Mm. I'd I'd I don't think fruit and veg is the sole criterion. Is the sole criterion for being um fashion fashionable or inspired by current fashions. Um I'd g I'd rate I'd rate this fairly highly from that point of view actually. Mm. Mm. Personally  I think given that the product um only replaces a single remote control that you've already got  are people really gonna shell out twenty five Euros for something that's only marginally good? Mm-hmm. I s I suppose one thing is that b because it's technically innovative  um for someone who's sort of technophobic  the fact that it simply looks unfamiliar would be daunting. Um. Yeah  got notes and doodles. Well I think this is a I think the digital pen's mostly for the benefit of the uh of the researchers studying this. It's all p goes into their corpus. Though it would have been nice to be able to transfer the um transfer our n our paper notes onto the uh computer ourselves.. Unti uh uh until uh until accounts came along  squish. Yeah. Mm. I mean I th I mean I think to r retaining the s the more sort of bio-morphic form in the articulation would gain more in s uh would gain more profit in sales than it would lose in uh in added expense. Such as it is. Actually I want th one thing I would say I mean something that could perhaps be part of the product mm the um m product testing market research process would be to uh produce mock-ups of both versions and see just how much of a difference the over going over-budget um m would make to sales. And we could even you know  market two versions. Wee cheapie version with the nice bio-morphic rubber. Yes. Mm. And I can get my bus. Okay. Thank you. Um obviously it's gonna be bulkier than how it looks  because it's gonna be flat on one side  so the L_C_D_ will be s sticking down like this  won't it? 'Cause it you can't get it curved. Uh because of costs. And it's plastic as well  so it won't be as comfortable on the hand. Yeah . One. Yeah. What about what if the the volume on the T_V_'s turned up massively and uh you just wanna turn down the volume can't find remote. Suppose you have to go to the T_V_ and do it manually. Mm. Like y you wouldn't hear the speaker. Mm. That's too expensive isn't it? Yeah. Fashion. So basically the only new thing is the L_C_D_ on the remote now. Oh  and joystick  yeah. So The L_C_D_ basically is the big selling point of the remote. But that's what makes it uh original though  isn't it? It can be s yeah  it can still be single curved  but You just. That's what we need for the joystick I think though. Costs four. Yeah. Are we going for a special colour at all? Well I was for a case. Or had you already incorporated that? Think it's ten minutes left. Special colour. Three. Are we going one on? I'd say we go two  'cause like f the fanciest would be the double curved. Wouldn't it? With the articulators. With bells on it. No need for teletext. five? Six? Six . Put a leopard print on it. Yeah we gotta. I'd say the colour of the border there world you'd find that  that's that'd stand out. Logo  brand. Mm 'kay. Yellow courgette. Well this this what we're gonna t this is their motto  like. And we're we're not doing well on it. Yeah  I'll go with five. 'S bad design  that thing. Mm  yeah. Well  it depends who your who's what the target people are  like you'd say maybe the fashion conscious women would be going  oh look at that  's cool  it looks like a it's yellow  looks like a banana  it's cool it's gotta look good in the sitting room. Rather than the L_C_D_ whereas uh more technical like like more uh people in with the latest technology it's good  it's got an L_C_D_ screen 's only got two buttons and a joystick. So  which which kind of people would be more likely to buy it?. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Good. Very good. We're burs bursting with creativity. And the price was like it was twice the w assembly cost. And would it have to be twice that? It could be like coulda had the assembly like maybe fifteen Euro. We'll still settle for twenty five. Maybe. In the beginning  yeah. . Right. Yeah I've got a if you load up my evaluation document. Mm. Uh evaluation. Basic point uh have a list of criteria that we need to rate the prototype by. Um then we will it's a seven s um seven seven step kinda evaluation process. So um not seven steps  seven scale. So after we've finished doing all the ratings for each criteria  we average that and that will give us some type of uh confidence in our prototype. And uh the criteria based on Real Reactions' kinda goals and policies  marketing strategies  and also those I put together from the user requirements phase. 'Kay. Um if you flip the So  those are the criteria. And uh perhaps I could have put 'em a bit better  but you notice a few things that we've totally abandoned  which means that uh the product will score very badly on some of those points. Put it mildly. So we have um true? One  t Seven  eight  oh. Fourth. Okay  so we have to go through each point. If we imagine it's actually straight  and just give it a a score. So um how well would you say the prototype is uh how well have we realised the dream of being able to stop remotes from from being lost  or to be able to find them once they are lost. I mean  uh is the homing thing still the locator  is that still Sure. And Adam  we can keep that in? Okay. Sure. T Sure. Mm. Bright colour. So we still have that noise thing  yeah? Os on a scale of one to seven  how would you guys rate it for finding finding it once it's lost? Number one? Okay. Number number one for the first criteria. Yeah you can tell what room the mobile is Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. You wanna say something? That's fine. Oh that's that's fine. What do you mean cr is there anything I wanna Um  a few. Something I neglected from my initial research is that Real Reactions has a a goal strategy that all of the products be inspired by material fashion  and clothing fashion. That is why fruit and veg being popular in the home and in clothing was important and they want all their products to be somehow inspired by current trends in fashion. So they say we put the fashion in electronics  well they really mean it they they're very big on fashion  so. That's this bit right here. And uh this bit is this one easy to use for visitors or for anybody? I guess it's just the same as saying easy to use interface  so it's kinda condensed into one. And we can come back to it  you said. So. Different languages? Yeah. Mm. Do you have any data on how much um different prints cost? I mean can you get the entire thing printed with a design um?. Yeah  yeah. Why would why would that be more expensive than an individual push button and scroll wheel together? That's quite significantly expensive.. Yeah. We don't even have uh speakers here. The like uh we uh what about speakers and transmitters and stuff like that? Have we factored that in? Transmitter  receiver  speakers. Plus the extra device itself that's gonna be on a T_V_. Is that gonna be a button  or Yeah. I I mean it's not on here  but um. Did they s do we have to use an advanced chip for the L_C_D_? Okay. Well that's yeah. What's a hand dyna dynamo? You have to wind it up? Technology. Yeah. Okay. And we couldn't replace the joystick  right? Because we would need four extra buttons to replace it  up down left and right  and that would be more expensive than a but is a scroll wheel not just back and forward? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um. Uh k Does this does this bear in mind that I mean it's a bit ridiculous that they're gonna charge us what is it  like this much money for three million if we're gonna buy three million components  you know. Mm. 'Kay. I think so. Yeah. Could we could we not get rid of the curvy the curvous the curvaceousness and focus on the menu being the best interface? 'Cause like we do we have re restrictions on software? Oh but there has to be joystick. Okay. Sure. Okay  my bad. So I think the product is not gonna perform so well for my criteria. Oh  wait a minute. Sample speaker? What is a sample speaker? Is that somewhat similar to what we want? Yeah. You got a email about voice response? I did not  so. We won't go with that one  did you say? I mean I we Okay  okay. So it looks like we're gonna get rid of the whole loca locator thing. Okay. Okay. Oh  special colour for the case. Mm-hmm. W what's the default colour? White or black? Right. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Okay. Okay. So uh Right okay. Okay. 'Kay. Ability to stop remotes from being lost or to find them once they are lost. Um. Okay. Special colour. Uh uh four. Three if we're being generous  I feel. Think we're being generous here with three. Mm. Yeah. Okay. Reduce the number of unused buttons. We're down to t two buttons  is it? Okay  so that's a one. You know  where that's Okay  that was good. Easy to use interface  buttons menu  menus that's yeah that's good. 'Kay that's we're not doing so badly. Um easy to use oh okay  let's forget that one. Fancy looking. Sure. And we could do whatever we like with the L_ L_C_D_. Yeah let's just assume it's a good L_C_D_ display. Maybe I was panicking for no reason. Yeah  w maybe you'd be a bit too yeah. There we go. Yeah  that's m that's that's better too. More accurate numbers. Technologically innovative. Well  we're getting rid of the locator thing which which yeah. 'Kay. Yeah  mobile phones. And y what you're doing is moving the menu from the television to the remote control  so it's You say three? I might go as far as two on that. Three. Three. Okay. Okay. Materials that people find pleasing. Sponginess is what they really would have wanted  apparently. Yeah. That's true. It's not a step backwards. Yeah  okay let's give it a six. Okay  that's totally thrown everything off balance. Inspired by the latest interior and clothing fashion. W we could. What colour were we gonna make it? I know  but But um by this I think it's more a case of fruit and veg  Yeah. Mm. But Th th they're referring to the fruit and veg thing. Is this like a banana type colour? Could we stretch no still  it's not shaped like a banana is Oh is that 'cause it's flat? What is what fruit or veg is flat? Yeah. Or we might have to suffer badly for this one as well. Four? Oh that's it's very ambitious  yeah  um. Sure. Inspired by. Yeah. This is their strategy. I m imagine we actually had some money invested in this and the amount that we invest is gonna be proportional to the marks. Might we might wanna be a bit more skepible sceptical about this one. I would say I mean it's it's not at all  right? In any way or shape or form. We didn't m Okay  the the yellow banana like thing is I think is okay. Right five. Is that sound reasonable? Five. Yeah. 'Kay  so we have one  two  three  four  five  six  seven. So five  seven  ten  sixteen  twenty one. Which gives us an average of three. It's well this would be in the middle. So we it's it's not bad. It's in the good section. Oops. Sorry. I'm I'm sorry. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Even if we were to increase this entire thing by by seven  we were to go down a grade to to four  we would have to do I mean we didn't we weren't that kinda optimistic too optim overly optimistic. You know like we didn't we didn't add we didn't subtract a whole seven points from these things  so I think we're definitely on the good bit. Even if we gave this one seven and this one seven  that's still only three extra points over seven. You know  it's yeah  we did it w it was okay. It was good. Mm-hmm. I think so. I mean my mum still has not learnt how to use text messaging on her phone  and she's had it for a long time  you know. She uses it to make phone calls and that's it. Yeah. So I think if sh if my mum saw a remote control like this with only two buttons and a joystick  I mean that'll probably be the first one she decides not to buy  you know. She'd be like is this a remote control  I don't how do you use it  and stuff like that. So even if it is really user friendly to us  but we're used to using menus all the time. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's totally uh radical to have a remote control with no no numbered buttons  yeah. But like radical good  maybe. Wrote nearly a page  but not. I think tracking. Yeah  that woulda been pretty good. I'd yeah I liked it  yeah. I li yeah  top marks. Well yeah. We we're not lacking in ideas  you know it's that was not the problem. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Maybe the counts wou woulda been better if we had a list or more Yeah  to begin with. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And like response from consumers. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay  let's Thank you. I was actually kind of upset you know at the budget  and that we had to cut a lot of stuff. It's like man  we we can't have the locator thing. And s yeah that's just bad. Do you think maybe the prices were were made? That should hopefully do the trick  um. 'Kay. Sorry about the small delay. Falling a little bit behind schedule. And that's uh fifteen twenty five. Okay. So just to try and roughly go over what we agreed in the last one  um we're gonna go for something uh uh how was it? Uh The new black  I believe. Um something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end  though we should never avoid functionality  of course. Uh many of our components are gonna be standard  off the shelf  but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an L_C_D_ display. Um other things were we were hoping to use rubber  most likely gonna be double curved  etcetera. Okay. So um due to your hard work  we might as well let the uh two designers go first  and uh show us the prototype. Quite how the best way to do this is  I'm not sure  but Okay. I'm afraid yeah. We'll go into that a bit more  but please go on. Mm. Okay  yeah. Great. Um. Yeah  okay. Excellent work. Um. Yeah  I believe so. So I mean I don't think anybody could actually stop a remote being lost  'cause that would mean doing something about the human element  but I'd like to think that we've done something about finding the damn thing once we have. Mm. Um just before we go through all of the steps here  um well what we'll do is um if we can look at the criteria you're gonna evaluate  and then we'll come back to the product evaluation if that's alright. Yeah  is that Um so is there anything here that you that you wanted to cover as in the criteria that you've covered? And then we'll come back pretty much promptly to this. I is there any of these criteria that need any explaining? Or is there anything that yous thought tha really would stand out compared to the others? Okay. Okay. No and which we will do very very shortly. Um. Okay. Slight problem we had was that we have an amazing four Euros over budget for what we were hoping to do. Um most of it stems from the use of the L_C_D_ which I think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure because of course we required a chip as well. Um the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a L_C_D_  at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface  require more buttons  etcetera. Or what we did was that we um we as in I as I was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure. Um changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the um proposed costs and we're just scraping it in  we've got point two of a Euro left over there. So we're just managing it really. Even then as well  um there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick so I've used what I think's appropriate. With any luck that won't mean that we've incurred more cost than we can actually afford to. It blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side  for example the possibility of having a U_S_B_ connection is definitely not viable now. Um. That should still be viable. We've got an advanced chip  we've got the use of the L_C_D_. So being able to communicate in multiple languages is still very much a possibility. Um but what's something we need to decide on is how we're gonna go from here. We do need to try and come up with an idea which could be continued with other people if need be. Um. We can I can bring the excel up sheet up and uh show you if you wish um. I really think as m much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design  possibly meaning that the L_C_D_ wouldn't be in this perfect place. It might be s stuck like slightly between what would be good for left handed and what would be good for a right handed person. Okay. It very much is about making concessions  unfortunately. Um. Um b b b da is you mean on the plastic  or? Let's have a look. You now have as much information as I do. Um. So as you can see here  for example  the battery really not very little choice in that one. We've gone for one of the cheaper options as well. Unfortunately we require the advanced chip if we're gonna do what we're needing to. I've said single curved. We really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it. Um plastic for some reason incurs no cost  which I've had to very much make advantage of  despite the fact that rubber's only got a value of two Euros per unit. Problem comes here as you can see in the interface. Um if I've read this thing correctly  then we can save point five of a Euro here in that it's not per push button. That might make sense  because then a numeric keypad would come in at um what  four point five Euros  which is an awful lot  so that could well be wrong. Even if we save point five there  it would just mean that we're most likely placing it in actually just gaining a colour for the unit  which has had to be put to one side. As you can see  the use of an L_C_ display um advanced chip and what would determine the scroll wheel here as well because it's an integrated scroll scroll wheel push button that wasn't quite what I think they had in mind with a joystick. I that's something you'll have to take up with the bean counters. Um as you can see I mean that's taken up well over half of the price. So um I'm very much open to suggestions of where we go  but because we need to shed what was four Euros off of the um the price of for what we really desired  this one comes in under price as you can see  but this was the one that sacrificed the material for the case and for the actual case design. Uh no  we haven't  not That'll it literally would just be a button. We might have to It looks like almost nothing Mm. Oh good call  I missed that. that's a very valid point. So if we're gonna go with the L_C_ display  then that's I believe so  yeah. That would probably not be in keeping with the um the fashion statement and such  yeah. Being manipulated by the joystick  yeah. Which I'm defining as scroll wheel. Um. Yeah it's just because there was no actual definition for what a joystick might be  that that's what I've labelled it for the purposes of this evaluation. If we remove the L_C_ display  we could save ourselves a fair amount. Which you could It's a shame. We should possibly have If we could've increased the price we could've manufactured that and we could've got something far closer to what we were hoping to. Again  you'll have to argue with the accountants on that one. Um but for the purposes of this meeting  I'm we're gonna have to stick with these figures. So  I would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're gonna keep the L_C_ display 'cause it's about what really separates us  despite the cost it's gonna incur. Um are people maybe not happy with  but are willing to go ahead with this in going for a plastic solid case  to keep the L_C_D_? It's hard to tell. Um I would say that you're at least gonna take double curved  and even then I'm not quite sure if that's incorporating the idea of articulation. Single curved with articulation? But the curves all o over hand  is it? We wouldn't actually save a lot by reducing it anyway  so I mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation. Um unless we hear otherwise we could go ahead with that proposal. Which is what we can get onto now. As long as so are we gonna say w we have to keep an eye on the time as well  but we're gonna say um single curved design It could well be  but at a cost of Okay  yeah we'll definitely won't go with that one. Yeah  that's voice recognition  so. Um. So  okay yeah  battery definitely  It looks like it unless we can manage to put it in under point two Euros  um. Maybe even slight well oh yeah  pretty much point two Euros  I'd say. So we'll leave that one for now. we'll just have It's uh a case of um I'm uh slightly unsure. One point five of a Euro for one push button doesn't sound quite right. So maybe it's a case of a push button is maybe one or more. Um. At which point if Well you got point five there. It's literally a case of whether or not this is correct. I'm not quite sure if they're I don't think they mean point five Euros per button. So There we go. Black's probably the normal colour you'd say  yeah. I quite like that colour that you're fetching there  it's uh definitely for make it glow in the dark even better. So will we go with that then? It's not and we can see we'll come back to uh your evaluation which you're probably now going to pan us but there we go. Just to give you an idea  um you want to go maybe a bit quickly as well  I'm not sure how much time. We've not hit the five minute mark warning yet  but. Ten. Mm mm four? Three? Mm. Okay. Two buttons. Yeah. I'd say we're doing well there. Mm-hmm. As he models the I'd Yeah. Which is a shame. Mm. I'd be tempted with three  yeah. We'll get panned on the next one  anyway. Yeah  w It is  yeah. Don't blame them. Um because of the way that we've minimalised the number of buttons and such. Plastic  it sucks. But it's no worse than any of the other pl remote controls we have. Like yellow  yeah. It would also help keep the the product placement s yeah. Is it inspired by clothing fashion? Yes. It's kind o it probably Well I mean it's probably more fruit and veg than most other things out there bar fruit and veg  so  what  four? Is that being too generous? Oh dear . What would you think yourself? Well  it's kind of curved and we can make it yellow  and that's pretty much banana like. Si it's got a curve to it. Am I do you think I'm stretching the uh the use of the banana? It's not bad and considering the don't pick the pen. Um. Y oh and you've knocked batteries out. Um right okay it's considering the price we had to get this in  to have a positive you know  even based on the four of us being heavily biased  um it was gonna be quite hard to get anything standing out I'd say possibly  based on um the the cost features. Maybe it's been targeted Hide it in the fruit basket. Probably the people technologically. They're usually the ones that buy pointless stuff. Mm-hmm. Okay. Um don't know how lo much longer we've got. At least five minutes I think. Um quickly we'll pop onto project evaluation. Um. So  we've got these uh four criteria here for uh satisfaction. Does anybody want to um um do you have any opinions on any of them? For example um we'll work backwards I suppose. The ability to work on this project using the technology we've been presented with. Um people made good use of the uh pen and paper? I would say I'm not quite sure what the advantage for us using a digital pen might be. Mm. It must It does seem like the paper's still a heavy consideration for taking notes. So maybe this is literally just a way around it. Um I dunno. How are people satisfied with the teamwork we've managed to display today? Leadership. As much as can be leadered in this uh thing. Um last one we've got is room for creativity. Now  I think we got Yeah I think of in the end  ideas that can be used sadly. Not so much that we weren't full of ideas  but of ones that are gonna allow us to actually build the thing. It's a bit of a pity. Um I would have to agree on that. I think we needed a larger budget. If you're going to aim your a um product maybe at the technological kind of sector  then you can afford to maybe jack the price up slightly from what it is. Because they will pay outrageous cash to first on the market. Mm. It could even That's true  yeah. Um I suppose these are all that will have to be taken up with a at a different group at I guess. As to a the costs involved. But I mean we've got a a prototype. So I dunno  I I think it's gone okay today  considering the information that we've had at our disposal  and um such. Probably would have mean we could have come up with a lot more solid design in the end  I would have to agree. It is very much a pity to um get so far into the stage and then find out that maybe some of your ideas are just a bit too expensive. Always hard to tell until you know the costs. Um. Okay. Are the costs within budget? Well  they are now that we have our slightly less than capable product. We've evaluated it  and we can say that we came out with a value of three. It's yeah? And then the final one where you get to call it Hal. But we'll go into that later. Right um is there anything else that anybody would like to to add  um anything they think that's not been covered  before I quickly write up a final report. Um I dunno  I mean we've got a product. We maybe aren't as happy with it as we'd like to be  but we've got something we think we can maybe stick onto the the market and sell. And of course something we have been avoiding talking about 'cause of we've no information is selling them directly to the manufacturers. There is a huge market. I mean we've briefly touched on it but we've no more knowledge then there's little we can say on that. Yeah. So um unless anybody's got anything they'd like to add  we can maybe round this up slightly earlier than we'd need to and then we can finish up the writing and such. Yeah? Uh thank you for your participation. That a question we can ask. ,The Marketing Expert gave a presentation about user requirements as shown through a usability study and demonstrated that only a small number of functions on a remote were used with frequency. She suggested focusing the interface design on the most frequently used functions. The User Interface Designer presented some questions that should be considered in making the device user-friendly and displayed two existing remote controls for comparison. The Industrial Designer discussed the necessary internal components and how they operated together  and presented her preferences for the type of each component to be used. The Project Manager gave the group several new requirements for the project. The group discussed several product features and decided that the remote will feature a locator function and will not feature speech recognition. The group discussed whether or not the remote should control multiple devices. They discussed important button functions to include and increasing usability by incorporating a scroll wheel in the design. The Project Manager instructed the other participants to fill out a questionnaire and to work on their individual presentations for the next meeting. 
Oops. Yeah  for favourite animals. It's gonna be not my favourite one but the one I can draw. And it's gonna be you'll try to guess. No. Yes  that's a rabbit. That's my favourite one. That's it. Hmm. Wow. No. Wow. That's cobra. No  it just small cobra  yeah. It's co c quite recognisable. Christa Christa. Hmm. Okay. Just tr try to guess who is a User Interface Designer. According to the drawings. Okay. On the international market. Wow. Mm. To eat? Children proof. Hmm. Okay  unbreakable. Uh-huh. Colourful? That's not practical. No. But how gonna okay  just uh but it's uh monochrome it's n it's not like Otherwise you will never find it. Cool. Ch Yeah  but without any extremes like n not of this size  not too large. Okay. Yeah  like a palm sized. Just to hold it. No  no screens  it's too complex. And n maybe not too expensive  well it's not my problem  but well okay. But no screens on remote controls. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm  mm-hmm. Adaptable. Alright  good  so how many actions do we need to implement in it? On off? I mean if it's less than three uh then we can make it uh like a like three mental states  yeah you know what I mean  we can just make it uh controlled by a brain  huh? Mm-hmm. Sh sure  sure. But for standard actions you usually what do you do  you change channels  you adjust volume  and nothing else. Mm-hmm. You do this? I usually just change channels. Uh-huh. Go back button is good. I once had it. Mm-hmm. History. Market Expert. Okay. Thank you everybody. No. Rabbit. You wa Is the white okay. I guess you can. Yeah uh not really. Small cobra. Chris. Mm. Smile fish. Yeah. Yeah  you're Hmm. Yeah  we're to sell two million then. Mm yeah. Yeah  pret Yeah. Ah. Yeah  we have some child lock or something  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  it's always black or yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah even we can change colours  no? Like the uh like the phones and these things we c yeah. At least for children like one colour and. And it should be really small and. Huh not so big like yeah. Yeah  not too much buttons and Uh. Yeah. Yeah. Colour  size  sh Yeah  maybe at least n not bigger than this I guess. Yeah yeah  at least it should hold in your hand n properly  like. Yeah. Uh maybe we can change the colours that at least the frame. Mm. S so then it depends you are to Mm I mean you c you can easily remove the frame. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Too expensive  yeah. Ye yeah. Hmm. I mean it it's like it's like two types no? people are right handed or left handed so y because I am left handed I use like this  say if you're right handed you use like this or so tha your switch on and off should be on yeah. Mm huh. Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working. We can adapt only one switch  suppose here like we can make two switches and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations. Two. Yeah. Yeah. Mm yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put yeah  you can only have one bit. Dash. Yeah you can yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah  the previous button is. Uh  okay. Oh uh. Uh. Yeah. Yeah yeah  what the which channels the viewer Marketing yeah. Thank you. Wow. Wow. Complex. Huh? A cat. No. Darn. Uh. A what? A r a rabbit  oh oh yeah  where is the carrot? Okay mm-hmm. I am not very good at uh this kind of stuff. My favourite animal is Guess. A human  yay. It's a very complex animal and um yeah. Characteristics of this this animal is dangerous. Ah  a kind of uh snake? Cobra? Exactly. Uh-huh. What about you uh Christa? A fish. A smiling fish. Mm-hmm. So  w whiteboard is working? Good. Next. Yeah  well. Not me. So. Twenty five Euro for a remote control. Okay. 'tis big number. Mm-hmm. Uh yes  we have plenty at home. In fact  my daughter likes l remote controls. To eat? Yeah  mainly  and to break. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Ye ye yeah. So she likes uh buttons which make click  so it has to click. It has to be uh wha baby proof yeah but mainly it has to be very robust because even if she's not very tall she's uh high enough so that uh when she throw it away it's uh So it has to be very robust. Unbreakable  yeah. Mm-hmm. And uh it has to be nice looking  colourful  maybe colourful  because uh nobody has colourful remote control  they're always black  yeah  but this one could be I dunno  purple or b Yeah  yeah. One colour. Yeah  yeah. Oh like the phones  yeah  it could change colours  yeah. Yeah. Good. Should it be  y you know these uh remote controls where um they are what they call a universal ret remote control so y you can decide that now it's the remote control for the television  then it's the remote control for the the sound system  or for your refrigerator whatever I dunno if it's Or if we should have a targeted re remote control. So colour  robustness  easy to use  size  yeah  size matters  yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm. But uh what would be different from this  from the others? I dunno if Yeah  at least the colour would be different. I think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're they never find a good button in the right place. For some reason they they they click the off button when they want to use the So there's a problem in the design of that kind of remote control somehow  I dunno. Too expensive for twelve Euro? Ah. Mm-hmm. I thought it could be only a screen which would change depending on uh uh the use or even the user. So ma I prefer to have the off button at the top right  so I would have my own design of the remote control because it's in fact just a a full touch screen remote control  if you if you like. I don't know if it makes sense  but Yeah  for instance  mm. Mm. Maybe  if if it's possible  yeah. Yeah. Three buttons you mean? Ah. Mm-hmm  yeah  sure. Yeah  more than three actions that you may want to do at a given time. Yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five. And that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five. Uh no. Because I'm only using three or four channels but And then back to the one I was before  so there's whichever it was. Yeah. Uh uh we had that in in other countries. Yeah e even the history so you could like uh undo previous of the previous. Then you can watch what your ah you could also record your record your sequence of actions  that becomes more complex  but you could look at what uh the other people have used there or remote controls. Yeah maybe it's a Okay. So what does M_E_ means? M_E_ the user requirements? Or that's uh that's for us? Uh that's me. Oh  of course yeah  the user requirement specifications  uh-huh  yeah. Okay. I'll think of that. So? Meeting's over? Great. Thank you. So  hello everyone. We're here to have a kick-off meeting for the design of a f for the beginning of new project um uh remote control for the design for a new remote control. I'm the Project Manager Christa Pavlov and okay let's begin. So I'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make a project plan  some discussion and then we talk of uh the next meeting. So um we want to to do a new remote control. It has to be original  trendy and user friendly. Um I think the important points we have to t talk about are uh it's functional design  it's conceptual design  and desail detailed design. and for that we're going um all to work individually and then have meeting during the whole day. Um  so let's try the whiteboard. Um so any of you who want to go. Wow. A rabbit. A rabbit. You want to go? A human ah. Mm I think you're supposed to  yeah. Hmm. Is that a worm? Or Uh yeah Christa Pavlov Mm. Smiling fish. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Next. Let's talk about money. So. Yeah  mm that's the price we want to that's the aim for the price for the remote control. We aim to do this profit. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm for a production cost of mm twelve fifty Euros maximum. 'Kay. So any of you have experience in remote controls? That So that could be a great um application. Remote controls children proof. Mm mm-hmm. Okay. So they have to be waterproof maybe? 'Cause they eat she ate it. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Colourful  yeah mm. No  that's a good idea. Mm mm-mm. Yeah. No  because you think  why not. Mm-hmm. Good idea. Small also? Don't you think No uh  not too much buttons or mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah  that's Okay. So  I think there's So you you think it's better if small than bigger. No  not too small  yeah. Hmm. Okay. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. So  some kind of idea uh with um um cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what no. Okay. And too expensive. Mm. Mm-mm. Mm-hmm. Mm mm mm. So adaptable yeah something yeah. Three option. Um. Mm-hmm. Maybe if it's more  if there is a software inside that ask you three Hmm. If it if we want a r universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may may need more than three mm three button  three mm possibilities  ye yeah. Mm. Yeah. I change channel like this  m uh I want to go to twenty five  and then to ten  uh-huh mm yeah. Also we can be here yeah  that would be cool. Mm yeah. Mm-mm. Okay. So I think we have full of idea. Um we're going to meet again in thirty minutes and uh I want you to mm work on these ideas and try to make a uh the ones  make um to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want. And um m maybe more in the technical parts what uh do we want to do. Um. So um your personal coach will send you some instruction for for this thirty minutes. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm okay. So. I think that's all. Yeah. See you in thirty minutes. ,The first prototype for the remote control was made of single-curved rubber with a total of 16 rubber buttons (some of them in a slide-out panel) with a cherry design on top. It uses kinetic energy and has a sample sensor for the speech recognition. The initial cost was calculated at 13.70 Euros. Although over budget  the team decided to evaluate this prototype before making any changes. On a scale from 1 (true) to 7 (false) they rated it on the basis of the following criteria: fancy design (2)  technological innovation (2)  ease of use (1)  incorporation of fashion elements (2)  and brand recognition (2). Changing the rubber case to plastic reduced the cost and allowed for an extra button-form and colour. The team were reasonably satisfied with the project in terms of teamwork and creativity  although they thought that the flow of information was sometimes disjointed. However  the idea of designing a remote control seemed unexciting  especially since the requirements restricted it to TV only  and the budget was too small. Finally  some new ideas were also found in the form of kinetic energy source and use of speech recognition. 
Ah  pinball. Huh. Uh  maybe I'll have something in my uh presentation. And you will see it. I'm next  okay. Yes. No. Here we go. Uh  at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want  our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to. And then  I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs  about uh what battery is in it  what kind of buttons also. First uh  the younger people  they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours. Like  totally yellow  totally red. Uh  so it's visible. Uh  the shapes are curved and round  like uh you also said. Maybe it's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones  straight and uh flat and long. But to give him the shape of your hand  so you it's easier to use or something like that. But that's just an idea. And then  I'll have to discuss about the costs uh of all the things for the remote control. The battery  there are few options. Uh  I think the best option is to use uh the basic battery. So  everybody can buy it uh at the at the supermarket. Or use uh a k uh kinetic battery like uh within a watch. When you uh shake it a few times  it it's loaded. Uh  the the form of the remote control  I think it's also nice have it curved. And maybe like it's hand-shaped. Uh  so uh you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons. Uh material  you use plastic. Hard plastic uh because uh it won't have to burst uh like in the in one time. And also rubber because the younger people like that  what we see in the research. Uh the push-buttons. We have one new thing uh discovered. It's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse. Maybe it's uh easy to use uh for the channels. When you want to go m move up  you just scroll up and click on the button  if you wanna see the next  uh if you wanna see that channel. And also for the mouse  uh for the volume  it's also uh easy to use. Just scroll a bit up  scroll a bit down. And that's also easy just w when you have a thing like this  and you get it here. You can do it with your thumb. And with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons uh if you push uh channel one  you can see channel one. The electrics um with a scroll push uh button  we must use regular uh chips. There are also uh simple chips. They are uh cheaper. Um  but then we have just a basic uh uh remote control  and I think there are a lot of those uh things  and people won't buy it any more. They have seen enough of it. And you have also advanced um chips. But that's with the L_C_D_ uh screen. And the costs will increase a lot more. And I think our budget is too low to use and an L_C_D_  and the chip who is more expensive. And maybe it's also then uh thoughtful if we u uh use uh as um different kind of uh shapes for the for remote control  that we then use the primary colours. Like  you get a yellow uh remote control  red one  blue one  et cetera. You have any more questions about this? I think the main thing is we look at the costs. And not too basic  not a basic remote control  who everybody already has. Not with an L_C_D_. No. Yeah. But then  what I say  the costs will uh get a lot higher. Th then you'll see it on the television. Yeah but l when you see a menu uh on the television  it's like you see uh one to twenty  you go uh uh s scroll up  and push number tw twenty. Mm-hmm. Yeah  I think the younger people will have newer televisions  which can provide our uh remote control. Yes. But that won't be a problem. I think. No  but then we'll get to the regular uh remote controls. And I think  what I said  everybody has them uh has them already. And they go to a uh supermarket and buy them uh for two Euros. Uh  and ge and get the most cheapest uh thing. And I think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news. I got it on my screen and it was uh higher. But I don't know uh how much higher. That's true. But then we'll I think we must discuss who uh what will be better. If we have a better shape of the um remote control  or better options on it. With a scroll menu  a w scroll thing  and a L_C_D_. And then a flat um remote control. Or  a more hand-shaped remote control  with scroll  without L_C_D_. I can uh look on my uh Uh Note that the push-button requires a simple chip chip. A scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip  which is a higher price range. The display requires a advanced chip  which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip. Doesn't say. That's from my manufacturing division. Yes? Changing covers. Nope. Uh  uh-uh. How w how we how we make it? Uh Shouldn't we first discuss about like what w we all Yeah  but if I paint with More like something M like Yeah I can't dr I can't draw it. Uh I have to. I'm not a designer. It's more three D_. Like  um when you have a part here. This is the remote control. And then you have something like th this under it. So  it's easier to get it like this. It's like a gun. And it has to be soft  yeah. So  you can squeeze in it and Sorry? Buttons on top of it. And here. The scrolling. You can do it with your thumb. But now we use one scroll button and the other one is here. One till uh uh zero till nine. And the b Yeah? Or two buttons. If uh 'Kay c If we do If we use one  then we'll have just a switch on it  and you'll just switch it  and now it's the sound to switch back with the menu uh button. And then you also can scroll uh scroll in it. Just not like all the other ones  with uh this thing  and uh here an arrow  here an arrow  here an arrow  here an arrow. Because uh  from h hundred uh remote controls  ninety nine have it. Uh  then we have it on the T_V_  the menu. I don't know. It's like some sort of uh teletext option  but we don't have teletext. And if we put an L_C_D_ thing on it  then the costs will uh be much higher. 'Kay. But you all like this kind of thing. Uh With the scroll button. And and this one has to be soft. And this has to be harder  because when it falls  it mu mu must not burst. Or some kind of rubber around it. Yeah. Yeah. Ah that's nice. Here. Trigger. Paint it? With the scroll thing on  like this? So? Draw it. But is it easy to use? When you have it on your left side  and Separate  more separate  h yeah. Yeah. On the left a scroll button  and on the right a scroll button. But would it be easy to use then? If it's like you have a big uh I also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for. They were like round curves  uh different uh Okay  okay  okay. Mm-hmm. Personally  I think two scroll buttons uh aren't easy to handle. With the switch button. No like uh Oh  you mean like that. Uh  then you can also have like uh th um Yeah  and joystick  I think. Yeah like in a laptop  s uh s some sort of thing. A little bit bigger  with easier thi I don't know. Or no scroll uh things. Just a shape. And No  no. It won't work. Yeah. Uh-huh. Or a remote control more like joystick. A small one like this  like a Nintendo uh k Playstation thing. No  no  no. I mean the the shape of the remote control. Just like a Playstation thing. Yeah. No  that's okay  I got Uh they're not uh in details. It's more expensive or less expensive  huh? Then I have to come with it. I got my personal costs. I I don't I don't know the costs. Then I'll uh make something up. Yeah  or the or the kinetic uh with normal battery. Yeah  I think it's uh  yeah  more expensive. Yeah. Okay. Depends on the scroll. If we use a scroll  then we have the uh regular chip. If we don't use a scroll  then we can use the simple chip. And that's Uh the most expensive. Yeah. If we Yeah. If we No okay scroll-wheel. So  I have this. So  it will be uh the advanced chip  or the uh regu uh or the regular chip. Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing? And then just put also on L_C_D_ on it? Just use your thumb. If you Yeah. I use my thumb. Yeah. If you have a joystick on No  if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh Playstation uh game controller. And you move up  f forward  down  left. Then you have uh just  yeah  a little bit curved. It's not just uh straight. That's how we use it. That's why they make joysticks like that  I think. Yeah? 'Kay. Here's our designer. Yeah. Yeah  why not. It's for the younger people. It's something new. Now we put uh rubber around it. Hard plastic  uh the shape  and around it hard uh around it rubber. And the uh the hand shape is also rubber. Huh. This is something new. Costs are okay. Oh  that's us together. Yes. 'Kay. Bye bye. Mm. Ah. Hey. Ah. Now I have my screen back too. Yeah. Yeah. Very interesting. Large. A lot a lot of buttons buttons. Yeah. Yes. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Yep. Yeah. But  thi i uh This is with an L_C_D_? No  not. Uh  can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with L_C_D_ or without? 'Cause it I think if we have an L_C_D_  it will also sell a lot better. And that might uh bring back the costs uh Huh. 'Kay. My turn? Mm. So So Yeah. So  my uh presentation is about trend-watching. Uh  I did some trend-watching. It's very important to uh keep up with latest trends. 'Cause if you don't  you won't sell. So  well how we did do that? Uh  well we made an investigation of the market  by Trendwatchers. They uh watch in uh cities like uh Paris and Milan. Of course  well known for their uh trend uh trends. And well  uh what did you find? Uh  we have two groups  young and trendy  and the old and rich. Well th and the young and trendy  they uh they starting to like uh fruit and vegetables uh as a theme for n uh clothes  shoes  and also uh products. And um  material? That should feel have uh a spongy feeling. And to get a feeling for what it is  uh here is an image of it. Then the old and rich. They like uh dark colours  and simple  recognisable shapes. And um  they also like uh familiar material  uh especially wood. Now  another picture. To get a feeling for this. Well  uh then already come to my personal preferences. We uh aim at the younger market. So  we should also be uh look at their uh trends. However  with trends it's always if there's it's now. It it it might last one year  and next year it be uh can be totally different. And I think we want to sell our product for longer than one year. So  we m must not just only look at what the trend is now  as it might be totally different next year. So  that's uh one thing to keep in mind. Yeah. Any questions? Yeah. Mm. Can make several uh concepts. We have this  and we had the idea of an um a more uh uh uh like sh in the shape of your hand. Yeah I I I uh yes. Yeah. A g Mm.. Yeah. And i if we go to uh But if we have uh a me Yeah. If we have a menu  uh how do we uh choose other options? Yeah. Uh-uh. Uh-uh. Yeah. Yeah. M uh yeah  maybe it's better if the uh scroll-wheels are um more separate  yeah. Like  you have the menu button in between uh Yeah. Think we have we have now two buttons missing. The uh um The mute button. We have two buttons missing. The mute button. And um  the to to uh have to uh numbers Okay. But  uh Okay. And on the L_C_D_  how much it costs? Uh  it costs extra? Yeah. Yes. Uh Uh  yeah  but Yeah. If you If we have uh then something standing here  with the L_C_D_. Um  Yeah. I can't see the. But  uh the easy of uh  th the ease of use wasn't uh the most important uh aspect of it. Uh  for us it's about to sell it. Uh One. No. You have more. You have still ten. Yeah. What? Okay. Okay. See you at the next meeting. Hmm. Oh. Mine. Oh  great. Uh Yes  well uh let's uh talk about the interface uh concept. Uh  first I'll uh I'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose  uh show you some samples  uh uh discuss some colours and design maybe  already. And uh my personal preferences. Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off. The bu uh the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off. The channels buttons  one to nine  and uh off uh uh zero to nine  and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine. Uh the volume and channel quadrants  uh left and right  up and down arrows  to uh do the volume and channel. And the menu menu button to man manipulate the L_C_D_ uh display. Um  I found some uh interesting uh uh samples. Examples. Um  well uh what's pretty standard is uh that it's that they're all pretty uh uh high uh Yeah. Yeah. Large and and and pretty thin and uh and long. Um  power buttons are mostly at the top uh left or right. Um  well we see the the the same uh arrows. Like there. And uh Yeah  well arrow b buttons can be blue. And what's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons. Some buttons have icons like the play and stop  but we don't use that. But uh  these we we have to choose the right icons  or or letters. Uh this is the V_ for volume  but they're both uh a V_. So it's it's not really very uh clear what's the function of that. Um Yeah. So  that's Uh  well Yeah. I thought that was our uh idea. So  uh how Like this. Or or this. And that the menu button is okay. Yeah  okay. Uh  so the The icons on the arrows  as well  you mean. Yeah. Uh  well that's something to uh think about. Okay. Um  well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already  or in the next uh meeting. But uh  as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo  I would uh recommend a yellow case. Uh  round edges. The logo at the bottom. And uh  well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour. So  it's good. Uh  recognisable. K so  I think. Uh  no. Not too much. But uh No  no  no. But this has to be has to be trendy and uh and Uh  yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons  and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh opinion. That was that. Hmm. No. Mm  yes. What? Mm. Yeah. But but i that's the only scroll uh button on it then? Yeah  okay. But but how Yeah. How Okay. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. And you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger. Like uh Just to uh Oh  like a Yeah. But if you put push the the menu button Yeah  wh what Yes  but you don't know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm  yeah. Yeah. It's uh Or you can uh turn it inside. But that's No  that's true.. Okay. Cookie. Okay. Well  let's start. What are we doing? Oops. Okay. Okay. Not doing. Uh Very good. Okay. we have presentations. So first  it's your turn. Yeah. Isn't it amazing. Industrial Designer. Interface concept. Can you go back one page? For the uh menu  what do we use for that? We don't have buttons for the menu. Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel. Okay. But uh You have to put it on the Yeah. Yeah but  has to be clear that you can use the arrows. Mm-hmm. Yes. The second one. Okay. Not too much colours. No  it's not flower power. S okay. Okay. Thank you. So  you're next. Hmm. No  isn't. But the L_C_D_ is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons. Then you can scroll  you see what number  and then you push. But then it's not easy to use scroll uh wheel. If you don't Hmm  yes. But then. Yeah  then you go one down one up. When you scroll. Yeah but like we said before  it has to be used on every television. So you may not be uh No. The television must do that. So Yeah but young people have to have all their uh room. And mostly they are smaller. So Most the times that are not advanced televisions. Okay. That's important. Yeah. Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L_C_D_. It's very important. Yeah  more expensive. But how much? Oh. Okay. Okay. Well  thank you. Next. No. It's clear. So now  it's uh Ah  let's see. Now  w we have to decide Well  we have to decide on the concept. So  we have to look at 'S next. Components and user interface concept. So Now  we have to make some concept. Maybe one of you can paint it on the board. First  uh user interface. Yes  a concept on uh Just Yeah  but maybe we can paint it. Uh  what do we want? I'll paint. Okay. Well Something like this? Or Shapes or What do we need? Yes  okay. Okay. And you have to. Yeah. So  it has to be soft? Okay. And uh  the buttons? Buttons. No  it won't. But  well there one for the sound and one for the channels. Uh  two scroll uh wheels. That's th that's more difficult. It's better in But if we don't have a L_C_D_ we don't have a menu. Yeah  but again maybe th How do we know the T_V_ can handle it? You don't know. So  there's no menu. No. So you can't use it. Okay  we make two concepts. One with L_C_D_. One without L_C_D_. Good concept. But That's one. It's one. Two. Number two. No. But when you handle it  you put it on and off. It's not good to use. Yeah  but I'll zap. Fuck. Out. No  it's not good. Now  second concept. One with L_C_D_  one without L_C_D_. Then uh Paint it. One with two scroll buttons and one with without. Yeah. Uh  one with a with a menu  and one without a menu. And the one with with a menu has an L_C_D_. Unbelievable. Do I have to do everything. Blank. You have Not so difficult. Uh  that's the menu. There for the L_C_D_ screen. You have to For the menu. Mm-hmm. One that way. And one that way. So Then it depends on the cost. S On and off. When it's not too big. Just like a a phone. Yes  okay. Very good. Is it better? When you uh the menu  you have to go there there there there. Yeah  okay. That's that's the outside. But now the First the buttons. Sorry? Mute. And the other. Yeah. Not so difficult. But how do you wanna solve it? Yeah but on the menu that's not uh easy. Then you go down  you switch  you go into the right  you switch  you go down. Yeah. A joystick. Yeah. But is it uh Does that break  a joystick? Or a small one just like in a laptop. Mean  it's better. But how expensive it is? Oh. Why do I pay you for? Um  well um Better ideas. For the young peoples I think scroll button's good. So Think we have to keep them. Yeah  but is it That's not expensive than uh Joystick is better. A small one. No just like in a a laptop. Small  round. Then it's not so big. Oh the sh Yeah  but then you can You have to use t with one hand. So Maybe  if it's possible  it's not too expensive  I think a joystick is better. A small one. So  please look at it. Yeah we I think you get it. So  after this meeting you have half an hour to uh fix it. Yes. Your problem. Not mine. Okay. So  do we have other concepts? Then for the components  we use a normal battery. Then it's Ch cheapest way  I think. No  no kinetic. Kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive. So we use a normal battery. Chip. Depends on the L_C_D_. Scroll. Yeah. And uh  we If you use the L_C_D_  we have to Yes  okay. So  depends on the L_C_D_ and the scroll. Okay. Okay. So  uh the shapes of the design depends on the L_C_D_ and But  it has to be small. I think. If you have pistol  it L_C_D_'s not easy. Y y Yeah but If you use a phone. k Yeah  but but then you have it. Like  th if you have pistol  you have it so. And the screen is Well  then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen. Yeah. No. No  no. Yeah  but then you look forward. And then you can y N well  if you have to look at it. Then it goes like this. If th n well Yes  of course. That's good good. But the um  it may not break. Okay. If that's possible. Okay. Yeah of course. Okay. Then this is the design. And the buttons are on the next page. So  depends on the cost. So  um we have one minute. I think. No. More. Seven. Next meeting. Thirty minutes. So hurry up. You two stay here. Paint it. Now you have to. So I think it's clear. Check your mail. So It has to be ready in the next meeting. So Next meeting is called the detailed design. So Everyth everything has to be ready. Thanks for your attention. ,There are some new requirements for the project: the device will have to be for TV only  they should ignore the teletext function  as it is dated  and  also  the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product. The target group will be people below 40. The UI preferred an easy-to-use remote to a multi-function one. The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip  and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared. The use of infrared  energy-efficient power source and cheap circuit was suggested. The remote could light up via LED's placed inside. Functions like zapping are very prevalent  as well as complaints about remotes being easy to lose. It also transpires that customers like innovative technology like speech recognition. The design can focus on such customer needs  like finding a mechanism to locate a lost remote. The functions of the remote will include a back button to switch between two channels  volume  program selection  and speech recognition  with a focus on simplicity of design. 
Help. It's up there? That screen's black. Alright  okay. Okay  that's fine. Are we done? Right  okay um  this is our second meeting and I might be a bit all over the place. Um  right our agenda for today  do you want us to give you a second? Okay  um I'll go over what we decided last meeting  um  we decided upon a universal control  one handset for all  T_V_  video equipment. Um  that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers  wide age range  not limiting anyone. We decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product  we put fashion in electronics  you know that kind of s thing. Um  our budget would have to affect um try not to reflect our budget  um that we might have a bit of oh oh you can see it  okay. Um dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like. Um want it to look uncluttered  undaunting to the customer. We discussed a flip-open design  um reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel um for further features like programming  things like that. Okay. Um  three presentations  I've got written here so shall we hear from Marketing first? No that's fine  that's fine. Unplug me. Um  F_N_ function F_ eight. Mm-hmm. They are. Okay  thank you very much. Um  would you like to continue on from that? Or  maybe move the laptop over. F_ function. Oh  there. 'Kay. Um  I think we'll chat about it at the end  okay so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end  um Ooh  it's vibrating  that's strange. Oh  God. Right  okay. We just do the best we can. Yeah  you might. Ah. Look at that. Okay. Yeah. Right  um we have new project requirements  um we're not going to be using teletext  um apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now. Um our control is only going to be for T_V_  it's not going to be a combined control  which limits you know all of the different things that it limits the cost for us  but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer. It says for T_V_ only  so looks like it's just yeah  I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it  but I don't know  what do you think? It just said  for T_V_ only. But I mean  general T_V_ controls do do video as well. I mean you bu well som you get com you get combined T_V_ and videos don't you? Mm. I think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and programming. Mm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah  bu We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves  so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing um because it is something I it needs to be the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose  you were saying whistling  maybe on the T_V_ you could put like a pack on the T_V_ or something so you can't see the remote  you go and press the button on top of the T_V_ and it beeps and you're like oh okay it's over there  something like that  but that's that sounds a lot cheaper to me. Um the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset. Um so we want logo  we want um fashionable  trendy  I mean what you were talking about with the marketing. Um  people paying more for it to look good. Um  we need to focus on that as well. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. What about you were talking about the buttons  um the controls that are coming out now have kind of big  rubber buttons  not tiny little one  big  rubber buttons  but what about  I mean  'cause we got to make it original  what about um you know with the touch screen computers yeah? Um so you it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which shouldn't wear out as much either  not sure about the You don't have to press it  you just have to put your thumb onto it. Um  think that might appeal I'm thinking kind of Japan  I'm thinking uh young  um office people  trendy kind of a thing. Um  but quite  um  easily labelled so that anyone can oh yeah that's obvious what that's for and it's not daunting to maybe the older generations  um Were too big. Mm. I think we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to uh in the sense that they can make it smaller  or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly  um. It's gonna be the same  so we need to focus on just one thing  not get bogged down in lots of different um possibilities  um. Or a speech recognition  which is extremely expensive  I think that's the only way that you kind of avoid that kind of issue. We are we're talking about um the type of company that we're working for as well. That they want um it to be fashionable  they want it to be trendy and you wouldn't automatically assume associate that with the older generations. Now with the baby boomers  the older generations are actually larger  they have a greater population than us young people  but I don't think we're focusing on that  I think we are focusing on a sort of mid-range um  business kind of class type people. Mm-hmm. Okay  so the remote control functions. Um we've got the T_V_  we've got the video  now there's um I can't remember what it's called  the little code at the end of programme details  yes. We could use that as an alternative to programming in times  things like that  is that I always found that really easy when I discovered it  um because you've got your general record anyway so if you there's a programme on you want to put record on  that's fine  but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you're not sure if you're going to  you put the number in and it's just a number  it's not a date  it's not a time  it's not a channel  it's not when it finishes  it's not anything like that  it's just a number. No. You've already got the numbers for typing in anyway. It is after um if you look in the newspaper  T_V_ guide or any T_V_ guide there's a five  six digit number afterwards and that's the number you put in and it's recorded that it's going to be on on Tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth so you don't have to worry about dates and you don't have to worry about times  um and it has been around for quite a long time. No it's not um but I think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that Mm. Okay so Mm-hmm. The functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there  you're pressing this button and your T_V_'s not doing it. Taking your T_V_ and your control and saying look this is what I'm doing  it's not working  what should I do? I think so. Um Instruction manuals. But I mean they're there's customer service  there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to and that way there's no call out charge  there's no extra  t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street  um. Mm. But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots and lots of pages. It does  you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong and then you try and search through it  so that should be something we think about. Um  what other functions? We need I'm not sure if we need a design um decision now  but we should think about c 'cause you've got the dilemma between oh batteries  that's what I was thinking about. Mobile phone batteries  what kinda battery is that? Well they la they they last quite a long time  and if you had uh when you th the thing that you get with mobile house phones  you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night or something  but it doesn't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged. Um  something like that should reduce the size of it. Yeah it could be on that yeah  okay. S Yes. Rechargeable with a docking station. So the rechargeable which would be your field. Okay. Yes  which it is cheaper in the long run as well. Um  th the shape you got trendy. I don't wanna big box with lots of things  you don't want a tiny sort of little thing either  because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many how much you try and make it simple  um They do. Okay so we've got a flip-screen. Um Okay. 'Cause it's kind of moulded to your hand anyway. Okay. Can you look into the company logo? Um  things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product. I mean for example  if it was a C_ or something like that  you could have it in a vague C_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell  or something  um something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite um obviously into the design  while also making it quite different from anything else that's there. Well we need to think about how it's gonna look different. Or you could do um different  like you get with mobile phones  different fascias. You could have different kind of casings. So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and Yeah. Mm. Okay. Okay. Okay. Right  I think we have to round it up  um Sure. That was um in cutting down the number that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions  making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date It's kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel  things like that. Um it could be it c It yes  it could be uh adv advertisement feature  um rather than design feature  you know  drawing attention to that. And it also paid um lip service in the instruction manual  'cause it's very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful. Yeah. Um We've got the buttons but I think we'll work through that with the design of it  um. Yes. Yes. And we've talked about um there being an alarm or something  a beeping for being lost  um. Learning how to use it should be as simple as possible. But there aren't gonna be that func that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the I the instruction manual  I don't know if we deal with that  um. I think Yep  and different from what's out there. Yep  I think that's us. I think you might get guidance  but um I th Instruction manuals  'cause there tends to be a demonised thing  u um  they're everyone's got like a big pile of them  but no one really uses them. Um. Yes  right. Okay. Right  okay. I think you can email me  if there's any more questions. Um and I'll be able to not answer them. Okay  yeah I'll go first. Can I grab the Thanks. What do I have to press? Oh  F_ eight? Oh right  yeah. Okay. Maybe Yep there we go. Okay this is uh the working design  presented by me  the uh Industrial Designer extraordinaire. 'Kay  this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint so. What the first thing question I asked was what are we trying to design? Well  a device which basically just sends the signal to the T_V_ to change its state  whether that be the power  or the channel um or the volume  everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to. Um  so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that. But uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people  we wanna make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that well it wasn't really my area because I'm dealing with the inside really. So um  yeah I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last one. Um and uh I found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the T_V_ presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use  wireless and  you don't need to send very much information. Um  most of them are powered by some form of battery. Now our one  I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control. Yeah sure. Um no no  if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries  they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in. Yeah the the well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but I'm just wondering about power consumption and how much you need to send the data across. Um  and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round. Um  now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller. Now the main components I came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work  uh as I said about the w which batteries we were gonna choose  we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller and to turn it into an i uh infrared signal which we're going to use to send the information. Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the T_V_ unless they're in a cinema  which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine. And then I was uh just had a quick look at the external design but I d I left that mostly to the uh interface designer. And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we wanna do. It's not a proper circuit  I'm not sure if it'd work or not  I'm not even confident that those are the real um the real way you'd wire it up but anyway  we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the uh U_I_ interface um which would basically  when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of I_R_ data which could be decoded by the T_V_ receiver  which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to whatever um whatever form of communication that the T_V_s are already using and since that that's another use and reason to use that infrared because that's what all T_V_s use at the moment. And then finally  um we want uh the it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that I've put forward are uh low in cost so that that should be good. Um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base  we were talking about it before and also just something that I was thinking about  uh because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have  I th that was just sort of a general point there. And that's uh yeah. Alright okay  and yeah  that's that's what I came up with there  so if you wanna Ooh. Function F_ eight yeah. No  no yeah it's just. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah sure. There we go  I've got a bit more of the cable. There we go. Uh you should be able to and yeah  there you go. Okay. Huh. T yeah yeah. I d well I dunno 'cause uh the w if you've g Yeah. If yeah and if you got if you got a Sky box  they have one of those plus boxes  you can record straight off the T_V_ anyway so on to on to like the T_V_ hard drive or so. Yeah. Yeah. Ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing and they're not that great anyway. Alright  okay. Alright  okay. Yeah. Yeah but um on on that again I just thought 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is so I thought that could be quite a Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Well y yeah you could you could have a number of different designs I mean inside they'd be essentially exactly the same. Just yeah  yeah. 'Kay. Yeah  yeah that's what I was just yeah. No  well no 'cause you wouldn't have to you don't actually have to press them you just Yeah. Yeah. Mm. But also er ergonomics as we're saying with the different designs  ergonomics uh there's sort of physically different things 'cause um if you've ever seen the X_ Box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in Japan wouldn't buy it because the controller was physically to big because um they're c uh just generally Japanese people have smaller hands so they couldn't get round the controller which is uh so if you I don't know what 'cause you obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Huh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I yeah I was just thinking about how you could combat that 'cause without without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel and it becomes yeah. Yeah  speech recognition  but yeah. Mm. Ge uh Yeah. Video plus. Yeah yeah. Just whack in the number. And you w yeah. And you wouldn't you wouldn't need uh a whole host of extra buttons for that  you just need one 'cause you've already got all the numbers there anyway  yeah. It's not Yeah. It's been been around for a long time it's just it's not very well advertised as to how to use it and things. Mm. Though if y if you've got something like Sky anyway you can just click on it you can just press the button on the programme once and it'll record that programme when it's on and you press it on it twice and it'll record the whole series. So that yeah. But just to have that function would be would be really good. Yeah. Mm. But the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they um the companies who uh who you deal with have actually they've they've got an obligation to to help you out and also I mean it's it's fair enough to have some sort of help service but I I'm not sure how much the cost would be of having Yeah  I mean I mean instru instruction books I feel c I reckon can cover that. Yeah. Department  yeah. Yeah. And they're yeah  they should be f yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's the uh yeah. Um they're they're specially made for the for the mobile phones  but they come with a charger  I mean you could you could bundle a charger in with it but Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah and if yeah if you if you had if you had one of those uh just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could uh Yeah on that as well so. Yeah some sort of docking station or yeah. Yeah yeah th yeah that that'd be fine  and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Oh God. Uh  no that's okay  sorry. Um is it okay if I postpone that til later  I just want to get access to a little bit more information  is that okay? Mm-hmm. Could I can I interject to ask a question there  is that appropriate? You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the surrounding it? Mm-hmm. Right  the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not  right? Oh I see. Okay. Mm. Mm. Mm. That's a very important part  it came up in our market research findings too so I can refer to that  whenever you like me to present. No. The plug hasn't come out at the bottom  has it? No. Meter adjusting. Mm. 'Kay. Have I got to keep this here? Does it matter? I'll have t I'll have to move it won't I? Uh  whoops. Will it manage? Bit more  oh dear. Oh. Is that okay? Thank you  just pull it closer a little bit. Get it right over  okay  thank you. Okay  um  I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research. Um  so that's where we started  we used our our usability lab  the company's usability lab  we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public  male and female  all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab  just their general use of the remote control  you can see we had a hundred subjects there. Our findings  lots of findings  I've just summarised some of them here. The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls  so it has obvious design implications there. Um  we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly. Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy  we were quite surprised by that finding  but um that's quite a high proportion of our our  you know  international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking. Um  current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall. For example  you can see below there  seventy five percent of users zap a lot  so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping. So again there's power implications there. Um  fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons  so again a big design issue there. Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control. Um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier  uh remote controls are often lost in the room  it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing  uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that. Uh thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use and I think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons  they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions. Um  um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury. You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems. Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition  again that was to aid I think in uh when they've lost the actual remote control  some kind of speech recognition. Something we didn't put to them  but which I'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light  possibly. Um  that trend reverses in the older age groups. So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features  that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses  they're not so bothered with this. I had marvellous tables and things that I could show you  but I think I'll just keep it simple  if there's any more information I can email you extra details  is that okay? Mm-hmm  so can we not programme a video with this remote control? Just channel-hopping. Would that imply video use? Mm-hmm  yes. Yes. Um we didn't really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about uh ten percent of the buttons  I think th th those do tend to be the basic channel-hopping things and on and off for the video  fast-forwarding  so on and I think it's sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare. So I don't know if that's something we need to look at. Mm-hmm. In fact I've just called up that table there  we asked those two questions  the table relates to both questions  so we didn't differentiate. Would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen  that's multi-function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control? So you can see how the the yes no sort of varies across the age group there  and a substantial number of don't knows in the older age group  I think that's just general fear of new technology. Oh yeah. Right. Mm. Yes. That's a super idea. Yeah. Yes  further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is  it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market. What is um attractive to a trendy New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African  I dunno  you get the idea. It's it's gonna vary around the world. At the end of the day  th the engineering design is one thing  it's the user interface design that may and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yes it will appeal to sections of the market def Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm  mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same  yes  absolutely. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I'm concerned  when you read the the R_S_I_ issue again  repetitive strain injury  I don't think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough  I think that is still a kind of a question mark issue how we deal with that. Um  R_S_I_ tends to be caused by repetitive small movements. I'm j I really can't get my head round this one  this may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it's something we should think about. Mm. I know  and it becomes ridiculous  yes I know. Yeah. Yes. Mm-hmm. Do we have to initially um  you know looking at the findings here  focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later. Do we really have to go for everyone right away? Um. Mm. And when we've been throwing up our ideas we're automatically talking about business people  young people  trendy people. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. I'm just thinking of budgetary issues too  for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage  we want to  you know  not waste money  not be profligate and uh you know focus on where the idea will be taken up  first it's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this. Mm. Right  I've not come across that function but it sounds wonderful. Ah  hmm. Right. Superb. Mm. Yes. Right. Excellent  mm-hmm. Mm. Right. Can I just run this past you while it occurs to me  I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another  but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me  to produce our own mobile phones  that that's kind of what led us on to comparing T_V_ remote controls with with their design features  um  chain companies like Carphone Warehouse  you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it  they'll phone the company  you can use their telephones. Is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar um kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this  if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets  th you know  which button is it I press for this? Th as free as a free aspect of our service  would that not make it more attractive to them? Mm. Mm-hmm. Right. Alright. Yes If it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel  but I mean for if there were any more or are we absolutely definite it's only gonna be for T_V_ and video  we're not gonna put any okay  just a thought. Okay. Mm-hmm. Sure. Mm. Yeah. Not for such simple functions because we're focusing on that  yes okay. Mm. Puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious  yes. Sure  okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. And we don't w I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical  these long  brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface. We definitely an ob an obvious thing  a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles  we don't want that. Mm-hmm. Slightly curved  curved. Mm. Mm. I mean look at the mobile. I think that's that sounds a really attractive idea  I've not come across anything like that before  if it kind of yeah and that opens out into your flip-top. Then it's nice t to h you can make it lightweight plastic  nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers  that's gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that I would think. I think it's a really nice idea and plus you can get you know even though we're using plastic  you can still I mean think of the designs you can get in plastic  we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Less chance of it being lost too  it's not like a chocolate brown lozenge that's gonna go down the sofa and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament they don't not gonna lose it so much either. It's easier to bit nice to handle. Mm-hmm. Okay. Can I just quickly um go over the new project requirements so that I haven't missed anything. So it's no teletext  it's only for T_V_ and by implication video  our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control  um something about Videoplus. Right. Right. Right  so when they press for programming you it comes up on the L_C_D_  a reminder about using Videoplus? So that they have a look at the guide and Or was is this nothing to do with the project requirements  is this just that was an add-on feature? Uh-huh. Right. Right  so it's kind of doing away with the programming feature? Right. Mm  and the rechargeable batteries. Was there anything else there that we in the new new project requirements? Mm-hmm. That's not at the moment a requirement  it's something we're looking at  what preference so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like. Okay. What would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting? Or shall I just sort of generally look at all the issues involved? Okay. Okay. Whoops  questionnaire four. 'Cause we're at lunchtime now I think. Mm-hmm. Sorry. Yep. Okay. Yep. 'Kay. It can be okay  that's okay with me. further. Oops. Why's it not working? F_ eight  right? Okay. Mm why's it in the right? Yeah  it's connecting. okay. Yeah. Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention  but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting  just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because um  I haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable. So purpose  as William already said  I would put it to simplify the interaction with T_V_ to make make it as simple as possible. And to summarise I I would say it's it should be user-friendly by being easy to use  rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever. But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it  will this two features together. So what the concept is to have a flip-top model. The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever  can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top. So it's like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people. Findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it's not of no use of punching in the uh trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user. As we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said? Yeah  with that I think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also  so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly. Um  that's so this is if you ask me personally  I would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use usage and all that. So in overall a simple and uh user-friendly design. Uh any comments like  if you want? Okay. I think you'll have to You can't It'll have to this can't be pulled. You'll have to push it a bit more. Yep. Yeah this is more than enough. Okay. Yeah I think you can pull it out now. Yeah. 'Kay. That's fine. Okay. Mm-hmm. Anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that? Ten perc Mm-hmm. Okay. Pens Mm-hmm. Okay. So are we talking of a single model or maybe five  six designs? Sure. Alright. Right. The features could be same and the body could look slightly different. So Yeah. Yeah  uh maybe to as uh it it was indicated that uh uh risk uh of uh repeated use  the injuries  maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that. So  a bigger b okay so y you're dividing designs based on not only segment age groups  you're desi uh dividing it according to the countries also  the market. Maybe for U_S_ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control and maybe in Japan and all you need to have a small  yeah. Mm-hmm. We could focus on the biggest market. If say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. I think it will be too much of an effort for a person to for a phone maybe he might walk down the street  but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that. Simple. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote? Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm. Okay. What I was thinking of a design which Nokia h uh came up with almost six or seven years back. Basically we have a flat one it it looks like a box  like a chocolate. That's very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up  so they came up with something like this  curled up  so here  and you don't have to you don't bend your thumb too much  so it's like uh you can say a banana shape kind of thing  curled up like a boat. G uh so what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down like. So it's already curled up so your thumb doesn't y yeah so we can have a s like you know moulded according to your the way you h hold of it's kind of semi-circular in the bottom  something like that. I wouldn't say exactly semi-circular but yeah smooth. Current. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. We could look in at that but Mm. What we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea-shells  logo could become as you could put a logo in the corner of uh the model  rather than you know  trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like. A sea shell? Yeah we could look in at that. Yeah maybe we could come at some say five  six des designs and then choose which are whichever appeals the most like  that could be the most common design. But we can like think of five  six designs. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. For detection  right. Yep  I think True. Oops. We should f I think it's time for us to get back to ,The Project Manager opened the meeting by reviewing the decisions from the previous meeting (to use voice recognition instead of the touch screen  to hide the complicated features  and to start building the prototype). The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer then presented the prototype that featured voice recognition  interchangeable cases  visible light  and a soft casing material. The Project Manager presented what each component cost  which showed that the project was going over the alotted budget; the group decided to remove the solar panel. The Marketing Expert presented an evaluation of the prototype and showed that the prototype had met many of the initial goals. The group then evaluated the project process and discussed their effectiveness as a group. The Project Manager summarized the proceedings of the meeting which will go into a final report  along with comments made during the project evaluation. 
Yep. Uh-huh. Don't think so. Jess. Alright  so I'm gonna describe the the concept of the user interface of this des device. Um we've talked about uh the two essential properties of the user interface. We want it to be simple and we want it to be fashionable. Um other we've also got to remember that this is a device that serves as a useful purpose. Uh we want people to be able to use it s as a remote control  so we need to determine what the essential functions of the d of the device are and make sure that we include that we've included all of those and that we actually end up with a device that is going to be useful to people. We have a number of different choices for a design concept um and s that's that's something that that I'll show you some examples of um  but essentially we need to choose how how is this device going to work  how how what kind of model is there going to be for user interaction with this device. Uh once we've chosen a a concept for it  we can then design the features around the concept  making sure that we get all the essential functions in the device and uh the extra functions and the more advanced features. And of course we also have to make it look cool. So basically  that's what we don't want. M we don't want lots of buttons  uh complicated features. We want something that looks nice and simple. Here's a a fairly simple device. This is an an iPod from Apple. Um I think the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons. It's very minimalistic in its design. Uh you use these four buttons to m to move around a range of settings on the small L_C_D_ screen. Um the thing I like about this is that it's very very quick to access the main features. Uh you can just about make out uh that the button three buttons are uh previous track  next track and play pause. They're the main the main features of the iPod  the things you will use a all the time. Um then if you want to do anything more advanced  you go into the little menu on the L_C_D_ screen and you use the buttons just to scroll around and and find the more advanced features that you want. So I think that's that's a good a good kind of model that we could have. Um here's a another example. This is uh it's an interesting idea and I think i it looks pretty cool. Um it's certainly got novelty value. Uh it's nice and colourful  it's nice and bright. Uh it's also something that you can kind of feel your way around. The buttons are are different shapes and and you can sort of yeah if you're watching T_V_ in the dark or whatever  you can work out which button's which and basically  yeah it's ith it's fun. So I I like I like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often. So you'd need a few buttons to select your favourite channels. I mean most people  when they watch T_V_  they have two hundred and fifty channels on their T_V_ and they watch of 'bout four of them at the most. So  you have buttons for your favourite channel  changing the volume  which is something you do all the time when you're watching T_V_  and the button to switch it off  in case you get bored. Um other features  things like adjusting the brightness  tuning the T_V_  uh I don't know what else you do with a T_V_. Um but these are these are all necessary functions. Uh you can't have a t there's no point having a television that you can't tune or that you can't set the contrast  so we need to find a way of including these somehow. Um and one other suggestions I'd make is to in is to include in a menu system  a bit like on the iPod. So we'd either have a small L_C_D_ display on the device itself  or uh have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television and can b be controlled through the device. And that would allow you to access access the advanced features uh whilst keeping a very small and simple set of buttons for the features that you use most often. I think that's that's one way to go  yes. Um I mean there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you if you have an L_C_D_ display  it's it's nice  because it's it it lets you just sort of sit there and st and control your television from your armchair. There are disadvantages  an an L_C_D_ display would have to be quite small  'cause we're we're I well we're I assume we're gonna be making quite a small device. Um it would also have to have uh a kind of backlighting in it  'cause you ten you tend to watch T_V_ in the dark  but you need to be able to see your L_D_D_ L_C_D_ display. The alternative is to have a an on-screen display on your television that you control through your remote control. Uh a bit like a bit like how they have these um digital boxes where you you press the buttons and it comes up with your this thing of watch lo what's on each channel. I mean that that's also a good idea. It's it can it does have it's problems as well  if you've got a small T_V_ and you're sitting on the other side of a room  it's hard to read the little text that comes up. Uh but that's a that's a design decision that we can make. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  that that would be one of the features  yes. But it's it's it's something to bear in mind is that if we put a display on the remote control the c uh communication is one way  so you can't have the televisions and information back to the remote control  at least I don't think you can. Um I'm not sure. Is that going on? Okay. Uh that should be alright  actually. A kind of thing that Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I Is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable? Uh like uh I dunno  like uh carrots or something. Maybe  or Kind of like a potato. Yeah. Depends. When you when you use a remote  do you press the buttons with your thumb  usually? Or your fingers? Or maybe you want something that's shaped like a mobile phone  so you you hold it in one hand  and you press the buttons with your thumb. Yeah. Maybe. But if you've only got like four or five buttons anyway  then it's it's not so much a problem  perhaps. So you hold it in one hand and you press you press the buttons with your thumb and And you find that works quite well? Is that The button on an iPod  is it what is it  is it just four buttons or is it li more like a scroll thing? Right. Oh  I see  right  yeah. Oh  okay. Yeah  that's quite a good design. Yeah. I think it could be difficult in practice  yeah. Also z yeah  'cause you would be z looking down at the L_C_D_ screen  than back up at your T_V_ and people don't wanna do that. Like  to make it different fruits. Yeah  it's possible. I think maybe th the packaging  it should be like a lemon and the the packaging is like the peel. So instead of opening the box you just kind of peel it  and the remote control's inside. Don't know. Yeah  um I think it's good  as as long as we consider the the cost and the uh how reliable it is  but as far as I know  the technology is good. Al all circuit boards are pretty much the same  I think. Uh it's fairly fairly standard. Um I don't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel. I mean it might be nice for changing the volume. Uh but I don't think it would really work. Yeah  you really need buttons for changing a channel. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think yeah  I think a scroll wheel would be nice  but it's not necessary. Um Yeah. 'Kay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um Yep. Um And I think if we wanna keep our costs down  we should just go for pushbuttons  'cause then we can have a a simple chip and it's simpler  it's it's cheaper to make pushbuttons than it is a scroll button. So in terms of uh in terms of uh economics it's probably better to have pushbuttons. Yeah  yeah  it's uh it's it's fairly simple. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. Yep. Uh what do you mean by supplements  exactly? Um Yep. Yeah. Um in Yeah. On off  uh volume  favourite channels  uh and menu. Yeah  yeah about yeah like yeah  a bit like radio presets. Um Uh we wouldn't even need the numbers. I think maybe numbers seems is kind of old-fashioned. Yeah  yeah  you can just and you need some kind of  I dunno  sort of up down kind of button  but the volume control could double for that  for example. Cool. Yep. Clay. I wasn't expecting that. Fourteen twenty six. Is double-curved like would be like two hands kind of thing? Okay. 'Cause I'm imagining like double-curved is like  you know  like two sides that curve and then like one curve would just be like a single vertical-ish kind of looking thing  but I've no idea. Sounds good. Thanks. Wait  but is that separate from what he was saying? Should I plug that in? Maybe it's just not Is it on? Ri What F_ do you have to press  five? I just keep pressing lots of 'em. Well  I don't know how relevant all of this gonna be. If anything  the that they gave me. Alright. Oh yeah. Okay  so we're gonna look a little bit at trend watching. Basically  I was given um an executive summary that was a market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted  and then also some fashion watchers in Paris and Milan commented on some things that are gonna be going on this year. So first um they had people they ranked um the important aspects of r remote controls  and right now i d they're saying that currently there's a functional look and feel preference  but that really  over the next year it it that's gonna be switching to fancy look and feel remotes  so that just goes back to the whole desire of our c Real Reaction company wanting to focus on fashion and so  even though we're stressing  when we're talking  we've all been talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea  they're sort of wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel. And as these are ranked  the top one is doubly important to the second one  which is doubly important to the third one  so just to take that weight into account. The second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovations. That would be like if we use something like the space material or the L_C_D_ screen  things like that. And then ease of use was the third most important  whi so really  no matter what  we need to focus the most on fancy look and feel  according to this. I don't know how much we agree with that. And then the fashion watch talks about that this year's top trend for clothes  shoes and furniture is fruits and vegetables and tha that there's a preference for spongy  tight material. And so that brings us to my personal preferences. Who wants a spongy remote or one with fruit and vegetable padding. Personally  I don't really think that I want one that's gonna go out of style or go stale  excuse the pun  um in a year  so even though this is coming from us as  you know  trend watch  market research  I don't know how much of it we necessarily wanna take away. Also  considering that the d research b has been carried out by Real Reaction  I'm a little hesitant as to like  how these questions may have been worded  and if necessarily this whole fashion to technology y edas ease of use is necessarily the right ranking. Personally  like I might reverse it  but if we're working for this company then I guess no matter what  we have to stress fashion the most. But it doesn't necessarily need to be a spongy material. Yeah. I don't have a lot of notes to share if you want them  that pretty much sums it up. So yeah. Yeah  what can I possibly enlighten on? Mm-hmm. Yeah  so something  m m instead of a necess yeah  grip  I'm thinking grip more than like sinking into your hands  you know  i and I think I'm envisioning more like  you know  the material that you have when you sit on like a bicycle  so that it doesn't hurt when you're sitting down for a long time  like I'm imagining that sort of thing  I don't know what th that material's called. Oh God. What about the idea of like a round remote? Instead of like a vertical up and down one. Like in terms of holding it. Like that's a f shape of a fruit. Just to tie it in a little. Yeah. Yeah  'cause otherwise your fingers can't move around. But I like i I love the idea of the wheel like the iPod. 'Cause th It's like five  'cause there's one in the middle. I think why it would be good for us is 'cause like you could have the same wheel sort of effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume. Like just the idea of like those so few buttons for main things  but then how you could go back to the menu and like  I dunno if we would want it on the screen there or on the actual T_V_. I kind of am wanting to say on the T_V_  'cause if you're changing the brightness  don't you wanna see it happening  kind of? And then you could still have that available. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. If I get any more information of fruits and vegetables  I'll let you know. Well  there we go. The iPod packaging is me like was so that was like half the fun. It's like the way it all comes all cute. Lemons? Yeah  I mean  it would t totally take care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries. Costs. But over time Yeah  it's a But if you c if you could scroll through the channels  and then the volume would just be and the volume would just be like the same way  forward and backward as I'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking. And otherwise  no matter how may buttons we have  we're gonna have like  you know  black with red sticking out and th no it's gonna inevitably sort of start looking like those group of sort of ugly ones that we saw stacked up. Oh could it be hard  and then something around it? I'm thinking curved of some sort. Yeah. And let's like see if we get anything else. I mean I'm not like hard-sold on the scroll wheel  it's more just to give it a different kind of look  but if it's gonna be in a latex type thing and that's gonna look cool  then that's probably gonna have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel. Like a radio type sorta situation? Wow. Mm yeah. Okay. That would be me. Alright. Well. Alright. Um I'm very excited by this one actually guys I uh had a lot of fun doing it. Components design. This is where you look at what does it take to make a remote control and what should we make our specific remote control out of. Um. So  we need to examine each element separately  but we're designing a full thing  so you wanna keep it integrated as a whole. The main elements of remote controls in general  and therefore ours as well  are the case  the buttons  the circuit board with the chip and the battery. These are all things that we had sort of addressed before  but I'm gonna take each one a little bit separately here as we figure out what they should be made of and what they should look like. The case  uh the options that I've gotten from headquarters about what we can do  um there's there's the shape of a case  we could do a flat sh a flat case  a curved case or maybe even a double double-curved case. I haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet  just keep that in mind  but these are the options that we have from manufacturing and we can make our case out of plastic  the m the main base will be plastic  but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in  wood  latex  titanium  rubber or other coloured types of plastic. That would be our case. Um buttons  for buttons we have um pushbuttons  which is what Real Reaction uses the most often  but we also have scror scroll wheels  which can have integrated pushbuttons  or we could go all high-tech and have an L_ L_C_D_ screen. Um circuit board and chip we can have a simple one  a regular one or an advanced one  depending on what our other needs are. And then battery I think is where things get most exciting. We're talking about long-life batteries here. Um we can we can have your sort of basic double A_ batteries  but we also have these options of um using a kinetic battery  like are used in high-tech watches  where you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up. Um so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery. Or a solar battery  although there are slight um complications with solar batteries as in we can't use a latex case if we have a solar battery. Or um something they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about fifty years ago  flashlights. Not quite sure what that is  but that's the description that I received  so that's what I'm passing on to you. So those are our options. Um personal preferences that I was thinking through here's what we've been talking about all through  fashion and simplicity. So if we're going for fashion in our cases  I think that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or a double-curved case  probably with a variety of design elements. Maybe titanium  maybe some wood. We're gonna have to investigate that better when I get specifics of the actual materials  but that's sort of what I have in mind. And we wanna go for simplicity. Probably pushbuttons  but I'm sort of intrigued by the idea of a scroll scroll wheel  if anyone has anything any ideas on that? I mean I know the iPods and things right now have touch scroll um buttons which are exactly like what they're describing  so that might be something we wanna look into. And I'm really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery. Solar I don't think would be such a good idea  because how often are you sure that your remote control will get a certain amount of light. But this idea of the kinetic  that you don't have to replace  and that a simple just shaking it around will make it work  I think that that m would be a very interesting thing. But I think we'd also wanna go for e a simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down. Uh we really only need a regular or advanced chip t if we're gonna start using an L_C_D_. So I think we want to be aware of not making things overly t technological if they don't need to be  'cause that'll keep our manufacturing price way down. That's what I have for options. Um I'd appreciate anyone's input  but that's what I'm seeing for the future of the the look of this thing. I'm not sure. I haven't received any specific visuals of this yet. This is what I'm sort of Yeah. I'm not sure  but I'll let you know as soon as I get any pictures. I know if we do have a double-curved case  it can't have any titanium in it. But the titanium  they were quite they're marketing quite hard to us as being used in the space programme  so that could be quite interesting. Space-age remote. Just all things to keep in mind. Yeah. That's about all I have to do  guys. I hope I didn't go through that too quickly. Yeah  n no idea  no idea. Um I'm assuming that a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight  and that a tita titanium is very light  I know  um but other than that's really basic  I mean  that's all I have gotten so far. Alright? Any other questions? No? Okay. I have save this in the uh shared projects  if anyone wants to look and I have c considerable notes on the topic as well  if anyone needs any more information. Uh Just in my notebook  but if anyone has any specific questions  don't hesitate to email me or something. Alright? Uh I guess I can I know. G oh  geez. Hmm. Hmm. So you'd be advocating an L_C_D_ then? Okay. Mm-hmm. Right. Right. Okay. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. Well Are you are you tak Yeah. No  I think I think we're talking menu like contrast and tuning the V_C_R_ or something if I've understood you correctly  rather than menu as what's on. Oh  good point. Yeah. No signal. Oop  there we go. Okay. Mm. That there's all kinds of scope for imagination in that one though. If it's latex if it's latexy Um  mean An uh I if th my understanding of a latex case is that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside  but that it's covered with the latex  which is spongier and softer on your hands. It's there's something to be said  I mean we we got that thing earlier from you about um not wanting it to R_ R_ repetitive stress injuries and things and and Yeah  something grippable  I mean we don't we don't we don't wanna go spongy  maybe. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah  I think that given the list of materials I w I was forwarded it's that seems doable. could we go in fruit and vegetable colours? We could colour-co-ordinate them  li The buttons could be fruit-shaped. Oh well it's quite easy to s shape thing like carrot isn't it? Or maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits. be yeah. It'd be harder to f bu uh buttons I think. It'd be harder to press button. Um I Yeah  that's ts how I tend to do it. No just thumb-sized. Jus Yeah. That's true. Right. I When I'm when I'm pressing buttons on my iPod  that's how I do it  hold it and press the four. Yeah. Yeah  or in and use my thumb or my pointer finger on the touch scroll wheel. Yeah It wel well yeah  it would I mean each version of it has been a little bit different  but Oh yeah  you had one of the in-between ones  when they weren't doing that anymore. Ts and you press the centre button  that's that's your all-purpose select button right there. Since it's the one in the centre that's not marked  yeah. Yeah. Uh uh t Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah  I think an L_C_D_ screen might be good in theory  but not as useful in practice. Yeah. Right. Um Oh we probably have to get going  don't we? 'Kay. Could Could we uh could we have changeable covers like for your mobile? In different fruit and vegetable colours  yeah. Exactly. And you could co-ordinate with your house or whatever. All these options. Ooh. Oh. Yeah. Mm. Options. Uh-hu oh  oh yes. Right  I had sort of skipped over that hoping it wouldn't get be necessary but um Alright  so um decisions  what the okay deci decisions on energy I'm thinking is based on the battery. Um I dunno  what do people think about this kinetic battery idea? Am I Yeah. Yeah. Right  I haven't gotten any yeah  any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery  but um but if we're using a an i a cheaper chip  then it'll even out  I think. Um circuit boards. Um yeah  I got a whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced. They're they're thin fibreglass with copper wires etched on to them  and di I think they're quite easily printed on by machine  which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us. I don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions. I wasn't really given any options  I was just given that this is how they're done. Um yeah  I can't can't really tell you. I can I can tell you a whole lot about how it works. But I don't know any decisions on Yeah. I'm sorry  I did f Yeah. Right. Well okay  here's the here's the thing on the chips that I that I got. Um simple  regular  advanced chip on print. The chip on print includes an infrared sensor  so we don't have to worry about that. Um  'kay  the pushbutton if we're gonna have pushbuttons  they require a simple chip  but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip  and an L_C_D_ requires advanced. Do we want a scroll wheel  or do we just want pushbuttons? Oh. Yeah  th it'd be it'd be handy for going through if there was an on-screen menu of your channel choices  than you can scroll down on the scroll. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. F or for all those secret functions? When you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus. Right. So we could either go with a simple or a regular chip  depending and maybe we could table that decision for later. I don't know. Okay. Well  let's think about that while we talk about the case. Uh I'm kinda liking the idea of latex  if if spongy is the in thing. Okay. Uh yeah  everything I've N oh wha what I've what I've seen  just not related to this  but of latex cases before  is that there's uh like a hard plastic inside  and it's just covered with the latex. Not too thick a layer of latex  just enough to be grippable  like bike handles or or anything that you've seen like that. The inside is hard. I don't think we need to worry about protecting the circuit board  I think that that's done for us. Yeah. Yeah. Oh and we want a curved case  yeah? Or a double-curved? Yeah  okay. We don't really know what the difference Good point. Yeah. I say pushbuttons at least unless we get any information but I have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is than than a pushbutton  but it's gotta be some more expensive  so I think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case because Yeah. Oh. Alright. So what are what are our buttons gonna be? On off So like one through five  or No. Mm. Yeah  up down. Ooh. Simple chip. Okay  cool. Clay. Mm-hmm. Okay. I g yeah. Time is it? Okay. Lovely to see you all again. Um it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock. Um okay our agenda  we're gonna do an opening  I'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting  then we'll have your three presentations um and then we'll have to make a decision on the remote control concepts  and finally we'll close. So opening. Um these are our minutes from r the functional design. We decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it  because we have international appeal and we said it's for all age groups  different um functions of it. Our main objectives were simplicity and fashion. And s um in specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost  large buttons for the essential functions  a possibility for extra functions  like a sliding a sliding piece and a long-life battery or a charging station. Okay  now three presentations. I'd like to do it in this order  first do the conceptual specification of components  properties and materials um and then the conceptual specification of user interface and finally trend watching. Mm. 'kay. Function F_ eight it. There we go. Mm. Hmm. Mm. Yeah  I wonder Mm-hmm. Just an interesting marketing kind of element. Uh just a real quick question um the weight of these different elements  have you no idea  okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm 'kay. Thank you  perfect. Um if you made notes yourself you can put those on our um underneath our oh  uh in your book  then don't worry about that. 'Kay now we're um concepts concepts of user interface. Yeah  um. This one's so much tighter than the other one. Okay. Nope. There we go. Here you are. Mm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. I do think that um one of the important features for a remote is seeing a menu and seeing what's on. Um and so like favourite channels is is applicable  but I think th that you do need to have some kind of function where it's um you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it. Like I I know I use that often enough. Well if it if it was a L_ L_C_D_ on th on the remote  I don't know that you could f that you'd be able to see a Okay. Okay. 'Cause that would be more specifically a digital box  mm-hmm. Mm. Okay  now we're moving on to market. Marketing. Eight. Oops  it's not plugged in  quite in well enough. There we are. Mm 'kay. S sweet. Okay  do we have any s some questions for this  let's see um. Um do you have any ideas how to possibly use these? Um how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or um or the spongy material at all? Like could we make a s like could we make a spongy remote? It would be easier on the hands. It's kind of and then it we would have to find a way to protect like the chip and all that  I dunno. But Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. F for sure  or maybe like um couple main ones being like  I dunno  lemons or strawberries or something. Could they be smelly? I don't know. Or carrot shaped  mm. Like large button  that's what I was thinking of  yeah. Might would you think you you do you think you'd be able to hold it? 'Cause I think the reason they're long is yeah. Harder to push. I usually hold it in one hand. Maybe But then the buttons would have to be very small. Don't you think? But I mean in order to get to all of them  you know. They would have to be within a certain amount of space with each other. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. It's a scroll  yeah  it's a wheel. The one I have doesn't have the four on i like around it  I don't think. Mm. Okay um we have we've about fifteen minutes left  so I'm I'm gonna continue with my pres presentation. Um I've one more slide before we close  but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this these kinds of things  so I'll just bring that up and show you all before we move on. Um Yeah  and then like the the covers could be spongy latex wherea but the actual model could be titanium. Ah hmm hmm hmm. Okay  um components concept. Energy  chip on print. G That's th th this is the agenda they gave me. So can you just explain what that is real quick? Mm-hmm. I think it's awesome. I think it's really cool. Okay. If they're if they're really options. Okay. Um okay  then we'll move on to the case. Um oh bu I guess maybe if we decided on like a simple  a regular  or an advanced chip  maybe. It would be nice for changing the volume  but I don't know how useful it'd be for changing the channel. 'Cause you don't have control over numbers or We have five minutes left for the meeting  so. So  have a scroll for volume? F Um. I think w well I think when we go on to the une userface  we're gonna have to decide the interface we're gonna have to decide um whether we're gonna have a scroll or not. Okay  let's do case. I'm a little um I'm a little hesitant about it  because I'm worried about protecting the stuff on the inside. Um Yeah  I would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Ge o Okay. So we uh we do want latex. Okay. Latex. Um and probably in colours  maybe fruity  vegetable colours. Fruity colours. Okay um let's go to the ufe user interface then we'll come back to the chip I suppose. Well  we don't really know what the difference is  right? Yeah. Um okay  interface  the type and the supplements. So push or scroll  right? Or both? Mm-hmm. And if we had a sc an on-screen um kind of thing that you could scroll through  like you can use your buttons to scroll through things. I think that yeah. For channel surfing I think a scroll an actual like an iPod's kind of scroll thing would be too fast  I dunno. Mm-hmm. Is that okay with you? How you feeling? Mm-hmm. It might be cool enough. Okay  so we're gonna go with um type pushbuttons  and then supplements  how are we gonna do that? Um I assume that's what else we're gonna like h ha the um the additional buttons we can use. So we're gonna have like a menu button  so that we can access on-screen things then? Okay  um so we're doing an on-screen menu that we can scroll through. Pre-set channels and then we're gonna need um numbers one through zero  right? Well  but in order to pre-set a cha oh I guess you can just hold it down when you get to one when you're scrolling through. Mm-hmm. Okay  um finishing the meeting now. Um our next meeting starts in thirty minutes  um you each have things to do  look and feel design  user interface design  product evaluation  and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay. You'll get specific instructions from your personal coach. Um did we decide on a chip? Let's go with a simple chip? Okay. We are done. Thank you everyone. Oh I di these are already in our shared folder  so. ,The project manager Sebastian opens the meeting. The rest introduce themselves  including Michael the interface designer  Guillermo the marketing expert  and Hemant the industrial designer. The project manager states the goal of the project  which is to develop a new remote control. It should be original  trendy  and user-friendly. He also mentions the three-step project- functional design  conceptual design  and detailed design. Then they take turns drawing their favorite animal on the white board. After that they briefly discuss finances. The remote control's target selling price of twenty-five Euro dollars and will be for the international market. They need to generate a profit of fifty million Euros. The question of whether the remote control should be for a specific device was brought up but not answered. The project manager closes the meeting  telling each group member what he is responsible for and reminding them that they will receive more information by email. 
Oops. Mm. After lunch. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. Yep. 'Kay. Yep. Fine. It's okay with me. Yep. Regarding those sizes  which one you think will be light because we we have to take into consideration size also  so maybe a standard triple A_ might take lesser space or and dynamo might take more space. Uh Right. Night. And are these like uh what are the life of the kinetic battery  it like it runs for long time? Mm-hmm. Okay. We c Solar would be slightly expensives. It's twelve point f Another question is like sorry. W w which one would last the longest  because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day. A remote control  like  so we have to s look at the life also. Okay. So Mm-hmm. Okay. Second thing is yeah and second question is like  a mobile you can change the cover  you call it a skin or whatever. So in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green  parrot green to chilli red or something like that. So is that feature available in like uh titanium  or it's like only specific to plastic or Mm-hmm. Yeah. Something like Alright. That could be a good idea. It could it would be comfortable to hold on also. Sorry I didn't get the last part  you're talking of Just what you said I I didn't get the uh meaning of it completely  you're saying like Uh-huh. Okay. 'Kay. Absolutely  f for somebody who very often  if he would a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like  if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever. And just one small question before like you are  regarding the circuit  since we are hav having a flip-top  we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing  so we can divide the circuit like you know. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay  uh would like to share something which I did here. First thing is uh basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting  especially from the marketing and industrial design  to check on the customer needs and feasibility. Second is we checked into competitors  the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here. So y you generally see there's not much of variety and like marketing team said uh  people need trendy  they are bored of black and white. So you generally see rectangular shape  very monotonous kind of designs here. And uh second thing is there's too much of confusion here. No particular remote is standard. Like  some some people have a Here you see this? This is on a I I I found th that uh only common feature is the ch uh channel control and uh volume control  rest other buttons  they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all. Okay  and second as already discussed with William  we are going to have m maybe a G_ G_U_I_ interface in the f in the middle of the flip-top and g graphic user interface basically which is what we d do in computer  have icons or touch pad or whatever  which is Like you have on a l uh icons or something y you have is a good example of G_U_I_ graphic user interface. So basically not point or click Press any particular device  he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify. And on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device  that means the use of button. So he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer. So we are having a combination of boards  so f on the s simpler board  on the top we have this button  rubber buttons  to keep frequently changing the channels. But Mm-hmm. Okay and you mean to the And the lower distance. Oh f perfect. So the findings are too many cluttered buttons. Repetition of certain but buttons which I already explained  example the volume and channel control buttons. All are confusing and in inconsistent. Okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition  there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature. We have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost  but for like we had g um s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it. So it could be like  where is the remote  and the remote answers I am here. Some kind of thing or it gives a b bleep sound or some kind of sound and if this can be incorporated this would be more uh you can say trendy also? And technologically innovative also. So we we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this. My personal preferences would be like  as already uh marketing department  they want something to do with fruit so I wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit  but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours  like the vibrant colours  uh red chilli uh tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have  like for example  i if you see the previous slide uh I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern  here  so we we we would not change h that particular pattern because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls. This is central one  the one you yeah volume and channel. So keep that m that standardised because that's the most common feature across all models  if you look at all the models  it's here. This and voice recognition. The kinetic. Mm-hmm. Maybe we could start with the black and white. That that way we could upgrade later. Mm. Mm. Yeah. And for the sorry. For the body design I think plastic  uh w yeah we could use the body  for the inside and uh rubber as a padding or for the grip  something like to add to the design. Plast right. It's Uh I it's different. Right. Acupressure  you could talk of acupressures. And finally the body should be retouchable  may maybe ch you can change the body or the case casing the case outside  it should be moulded it with the design in such a way you can change it every time. Okay. The rubber. Fine. Yeah. Fine  uh we were talking of voice recognition also because that we are not for how to look it uh remote control if it's lost. So  are we looking at voice? Or maybe like uh William was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on key chains. For l yeah  the whistle. So we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle. Yep. Uh sorry I didn't mention this  but we'll be incorporating in the design. Fine. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Again a questionnaire huh? I think we are pretty going in a clear direction now. I'll wait until you're all um hooked up. Okay. Put it on in that way. Thanks. Okay. Welcome back everybody  hope you've had fun. Right um this is our conceptual design meeting  um I think we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting  I th I I think yeah um. This is where we talk about um properties  materials  user-interface and trend-watching. So I think we've touched on a few things to do with that already  but we'll just go over it. Um the minutes from the last time. Um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext  it wasn't gonna be a control for everything um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow. Um we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition  we've decided on there being a flip design and um a different shape from what's normal. We were thinking a shell  but something along those lines  just a different shape from what's normal  um. You were going to look into the rechargeable batteries and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost  things like that  um and our market was going to be young  business  kind of range. Okay  so shall we start with the first presentation? Yes if you feel It's okay. Yeah. Okay thank you very much. Um let's start from the inside and work our way out. I don't think so  not yet. Um  yes  thank you. I hate those little things especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to undo them. Okay. 'Kay.. 'Kay. Wa can you explain that? Like a right  okay. How what kind of how l long can you get out of that  I mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night? Or That doesn't count though does it? I thought it was U_V_ like Any  any I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun. Uh  I don't think it counts electric lights no  but I mean not many you don't want to limit your market. I mean people who live in basement flats there's not that many people  but there are people. Mm  but then it would be charging through the day  I think the point is that it charges through the day and then you've got it charged for the evening. Okay. Yeah I've seen But then if you think about a watch  it's on your wrist so it's on your whole bod it's on your body the whole time so you're walking around  you're doing things  it is moving a lot of the time. If you'd I mean you switch the T_V_ on  then you put it on the side  then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side. Is it really gonna be enough? Okay. So it's not the draw on it isn't Okay. Like a dual kind of. Expensive as well. What kind of price are we looking at for I presume the normal batteries are the cheapest? Solar. Well they're not designed Practical-wise okay. You do get a bit of wear but don't calculators have a battery in them as well? Mm. Okay  can we add in uh an attachment to closing feature? Can we think about that? 'Cause if we're doing the kinetic thing and it's Well add it in to think about um because  where am I? If it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people don't do kind of we're doing something original and different um but if you wore it if it's something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less  you you wouldn't lose it so much. But then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than the eternal battle for control of the controls. No. Okay. Okay  right. Mm-hmm. What kind of things do we have to consider there? Can we what kind of size  does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Hinged  yeah. So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic  the fascia that comes off would be the rubber  like those pens that you get with the grip  that you can you can pull that off. Okay. Mm. Well that's been really popular with mobile phones so I don't see why not. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Oh it would be flat inside. Mm. I think it would be good to have a contrast between  if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside. Now how would you distinguish  if you had it bare  how would you distinguish where you had to press  I mean Uh Like one of the palm pop thing. It would have to be attached. Okay  we'll talk about that so if you finish your and we'll come back to that. That's you  right okay. No. We're marketing to guys as much as we are to women. Well it's a remote control  you were sitting watching T_V_ are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh shit I should go and have a shower and do my hair before I put the T_ Yeah  no  no. Mm. Okay. Okay  okay. Mm. Mm. Okay. Which means Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part? 'Cause if you're thinking about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press  just like a mobile phone. Yeah. That's what I was just saying  and then have the and then have the L_C_D_ at the top and then be able to touch that for the other controls  so have the um the volume and the programme  things like that  on the lower side. Okay. I can't see that  is that play and stop and things? Or is that volume and channel? Okay. Right. Okay. Um I'm not sure how long we've got left  but we need to make a decision about um the things we've discussed. So  we agree on Do we agree on the battery? Yeah. Um  that means that there's no function for li the port  you know that it sits in  then pressing the button then having so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it. It's a bi i it's like a g it's a gadget  it's a selling point. I think the only I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else  but I think pretty much we've used cheap relatively cheap and simple things. The L_C_D_'s not cheap. Yeah  okay. And you could yeah. Okay. Do you want like a back-up? Um  okay so we've got battery. The inside components is pretty standardised across the board isn't it? So there's not a really a decision to be made there  um. The buttons what did you give us as our The bare-board L_C_D_ or On the top one okay you've got the touch okay and then Okay  okay. No  it's fine. For the inside. Mm-hmm. Oh I think so  I think so. No I think I we don't wanna be tacky if we've got a kind of different shape anyway um the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap  so we could make it red  we could make it um psychedelic  you know  we could make it black and white zebra stripes  but that's not really what we're focusing on  what we're focusing on is the m you know yes. So we could just pick anything. It's just different it's just different from everything else and I mean  I'm trying to imagine um clean looking houses  sort of beige and black um so you either want something that goes with that  which is what's on the market anyway  or you want something that contrasts as you know like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they're so interesting and Mm. And you would just have an across the b you would have so many different options that you could do  you could have um a plain black one  you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little Mm. And ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes y you know  you could just go so far with it  like a puffer fish  you could just  you could take it wherever  so I think that's quite a flexible thing. Yes. Mm. Yeah. Okay we've got five minutes  um  or that might've been up for a while. Mm-hmm. Have you Okay. Well they do  but I think we can you could well it is  it is  I think you just address that with um advertising. Um  you associate the name with the individual product that it is and that does the work for you. Obviously it'll have a logo on it just like everything  but everything else has a logo on it. The point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently but I think it does  without that so I'm not worried about that. Depending on how i I mean we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company's looking into  so um that seems to make sense  but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive we'd have to cut down somewhere else  then it's worth thinking about. But I think we'll find out more about cost afterwards. Right I'm going to wrap it up there. I got a end meeting now message on my mo yeah so. Um so I think we've probably got it says  closing we have forty minutes so I um think we've probably got about that time before we come back. It's either that or we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed and don't know how long that took. Is everyone happy? Okay. Yeah  yeah I was getting that impression as well. Etcetera. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  okay. That screwed in? Yeah. 'Kay  Okay. Um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment. Okay  first uh the Into the method. The the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the T_V_ and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find. Um also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials  'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't un unfortunately aren't available. Um  findings  I've got my nice little picture there. This is uh the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals  based on your input and um it's pretty much used for all all T_V_ remotes at the moment. Um and then we we're loo looking into battery options. There's um actually no rechargeable option available  so we I saw the um the standard double A_ and triple A_ which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment  dynamo charging  I thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest  people won't it's it's basically like wind-up radio. So you wind up your remote control before you use it. It might You Yeah  yeah  oh yeah I presu you wouldn't have to wind it for very long  but I don't I don't think it's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options  like the the solar charging  'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you got T_V_. No. Is it? Alright i Yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up. Yeah  okay. But Yeah and most people most people also watch T_V_ in the in the night anyway. But I I think I think the the next one's the best anyway. The the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches and you d you don't even notice it. I mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up  I don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work. Um yeah it's it charges into um some form of it's a smaller cell which it charges into and uh the si the size sort of a watch a watch battery  'cause they use them quite frequently in watches. And that'll that would l would last for um well I do I d I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I've never seen one run out. Yeah. Yeah and Yeah but then again I I think it is because if you think about it  the watch  although it's only a tiny amount it's it's um it's always moving for the whole day and they don't run out over night when you leave them on the side. And th for the same the same reason  you're only using it for a v incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you're finished with it and you put it no no I do I don't think the the draw on it would be Mm. Ye yeah I think I th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they because  if you lie on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical. They're they're expensive  they don't Yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest I'd presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones  um but the It's i I think they're not very resistant to dropping  'cause if you drop stuff yeah if you if you have y the size you'd need to charge a remote wouldn't be that big but I mean if remotes always get thrown around and stuff  so. Y I think yeah  practically. I mean calculators you don't really throw around a lot whereas remotes you do  they can t Yeah they do  they yeah they've got dual things  but they're the batteries are smaller I think. Mm. W m yeah so the Yeah the the s if you if you had something du uh using the standard batteries and the solar charging  um  I don't think you'd I think the it would d well you know how long the standard double A_s would last in or triple A_s would last. Yeah I think i I think it would  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay  well I'll move on. Um  my second part of my findings uh the mo most current remotes use this silicone uh P_C_B_ board which pr printed circuit board  which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button  it'll connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to two uh different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then uh gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this L_E_D_ in the sequence of l on and off bursts. Well well this the thi the thing about is um they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print circuit board like that that it's it's simply spaced like that so you can have fit the n the size of the nine buttons in. If you if you see how thin the tracks are  you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one  if you if you wanted to but um the there is an option to do to do it like that  or you could have some sort of array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit so that And then to uh yeah  so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used. Now what I was thinking about that was 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things  they've got little lights on behind the buttons  so you can see what all the buttons are  like on a mobile phone  they do it more often than on a than on a T_V_ remote  but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and um after like five or ten seconds of not being used I'd have that turned off  if we decided to go for buttons that could light up. Um  the case material  I've a been sent what the factory can actually give us  the there's the plastic which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case case housing and the the main problems with the well you could go for wood but I think it would be a bit impractical. Titanium um very expensive just to process  which to make it is expensive  and rubber  well you're saying that people like this uh spongy feel this year  so perhaps uh some something made of rubber  but I was thinking more of the buttons  because the buttons which they've they've said that they've they've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it's meant to be anti R_S_I_. I'm no I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said. Um the problem with the casing is that uh there's quite um there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case. If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape  whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more they can they can do sort of curved shapes. But whether whether or not because we'd have it in two separate units for the flip phone. Yeah. Yeah I th Uh. Yeah in in titanium I don't I don't think it would be available at all really  the ju just it w well you could make it available in the titanium  it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it  because of the expense of how much titanium is is it's light and strong but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for for a remote. Yeah  yeah. Rubber  yeah. And you can peel them off yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. T Yeah. Also the just just going back to the interface designs with the buttons  the I kno we were planning to do some sort of touch screen. Now what I was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare P_C_B_ circuit board and I'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it'd make the connection over if you had them close enough  that would be one option. Um the second option th they offer rubber buttons  but I thought that an L_C_D_ type of screen 'cause one they're incredibly thin um and don't take up much space  two they you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch display. Uh what what Oh on the on the L_C_D_ screen you could becau you could fit it the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve curved things with it  but um you can you wouldn't have with the L_C_D_ you'd have the wires coming off  you wouldn't have that with the with the L_C_D_  you'd only have that with the printed circuit board. With W also with the Yeah. You could have a flat screen inside  yeah  but I'm just wondering whether we want an L_C_D_ screen inside. It wouldn't be like full colour  it would just be black and white  but there'd be touch touch buttons  so you wouldn't be pressing down on 'em  w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-R_S_I_. Is rubber. Mm. Yeah I hadn't I hadn't really thought of that to be honest. Yeah you could  you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out but I I think they could get a bit easily lost  'cause I had Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah okay. Yeah that's yeah that that's the end of m my Yeah. Uh yeah. Yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple  I mean you'd you'd actually have two separate you'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them  'cause in the in the actual flip bit you'd have some linking. Mm. Um. Yeah. I mean you can you could do it  you could have a 'cause if you if you just put the full charge through an L_C_D_ display it'll completely blank it out  but I don't know if you could get any mirror effect on it  I'm not sure about Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If you if yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this L_C_D_ screen. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  yeah but you can do it with your thumb li Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well  yeah we Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah I think I mean if Yeah it is it is qui it's quite a cool feature to have and also if they've got it if they've got these parts already in stock  then it won't be cheap to re-manufacture them  uh or it will be cheap sorry to re-manufacture them. So do you reckon that's a good idea that  where's the remote  I'm here thing? I think that would be quite fun. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah to s th well it's it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour 'cause if we've just got a black and white one  I mean they use them in calculators so. Yeah. Well you cou um. K no the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch a battery that goes in a watch. So it's a lot smaller  so it would Yeah. Yeah the well I think were we're going for the L_C_D_ on that one  on the buttons  on the on the on on the top one we're gonna yeah. On the bottom we were gonna have the rubber  the rubber ones  the anti-R_S_I_ ones. Um  okay on we've got the flip the flip-screen  the top one is gonna be the L_C_D_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons. Plastic  okay. Yeah. Mm no. Mm. You can you can just Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  yeah j with these rubber these rubberised ca not the actual uh plastic outside case  just the rubber thing that goes round the outside. Oh yeah  yeah the whistle ones  yeah. Yeah. Yeah  depending on the expense of it. And they've got in stock  so yeah. Yeah. Okay. Did it? Oh good grief. 'Kay. Oh. Mm. Mm-hmm. Shall I? Okay. We just connect up. Thank you. There we go. Okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching. Um the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on  market trends  were that we did our traditional uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w I'm sorry I'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch  sorry Project Manager. Um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we'll come to that later. So that was one of the first things we did. Also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology  we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan. Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel  rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls. They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative  and of course  as we predicted  that it should be easy to use. Now I should point out that the first of those findings  fancy look and feel  is the most important  is twice as important as the second  technologically innovative  which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use. So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important  but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at. Okay  um  now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group  um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there  that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes  shoes and furniture. So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too? There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials  uh again in contrast to last year. So a lot of interesting feedback there  both from our market research departments and from our people in Paris and Milan. Be interesting to see what our design people make of that. Unless anyone has any questions about that? Not yet? 'Kay. Okay. I know. Does does light charge as as sunlight does? Artificial light? Has to be solar. Mm. Artificial light  no. That's going to I know  different parts of the world too  if we're if we're marketing internationally. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Could I just ask referring back to solar charging  is that compatible with um standard batteries? I mean  could people put standard batteries in but with a s you know they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging or the two things not compatible? Mm. So that affects the exterior design. Mm. Again it de Mm. It would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature  i it's not gonna add anything  okay. Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because I I personally right  okay. It's not something that's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research  it's not a thing that people are looking for when we threw it open to the field yeah. But it's something to put on the side to think about maybe. Mm. Okay. Mm. Mm-hmm. It does mark quite easily too if you let it fall. I've got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it. I was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over  that would give the spongy feel  that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone. Like a rubber sleeve almost  yeah. Mm. Mm. Very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to. Mm. Yeah. Mm. I don't s sorry to interrupt  I don't see why the curved thing is a problem  if we for example had a shell  once we open that yeah  so it'd be f yeah  yeah. Have I misunderstood you? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I just had another idea  I don't know if it helps with that  but just to do with the R_S_I_. Is it possible  just as an option  when we open it up  people can use their fingers to press the button  or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to. Mm. Yeah. They're easy to replace as well  cheap. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah just a thought they wouldn't actually need one and they could use anything they've got  couldn't they? A pencil or a pen  so they wouldn't really need a Mm-hmm. I'll just raise another point while it occurs to me  it kind of applies to both our designers here  so I'm not sure how it would fit in. If we flip open  now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display  you seen those? And they kind of respond to the turn of your body. Is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th uh the remote control display thing. They don't look at themselves? Just a thought. Yeah. I know what you mean  it's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph it's with us using the ideas for mobile phones I kinda got sidetracked onto that I think  okay. trying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much but maybe we'll leave that one on the side. 'Kay. Mm. Oh I think forget about the mirror that was just a very quick passing thought yeah. Sorry what does that stand for? Okay. No you'd hold it you don't if you flip it open then you'd be Wouldn't you? Isn't that the idea? You us if we just use the shell as an example again  you open that  you've got your L_C_D_ display there and you've got the buttons there so you're holding it in the palm of your hand  yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Mm. Mm. Kinetic? Mm. Mm. Hmm. Yeah  we talked about kinetic charging  we've deci seem to have decided on that  did we decide on double A_ or triple A_ batteries? No  one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double A_ or triple A_ batteries 'cause they've still got to be charged this way haven't they? I oh I see. Right  okay  got you. Got you on that okay  didn't realise. Sorry could you repeat that last part? L_C_D_ screen. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm  so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell  a variety of designs  okay. and it is just uh although it's rubberised and spongy  apart from that we're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colours  we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else  like a shell that we discussed  just go for the colours. Okay. Mm-hmm. The feel. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Is that going to be this image I've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that  maybe about that size  made of plastic  fits into the palm of the hand  rubberised cover that's spongy. Is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted  market research  is that fancy? Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'm just kind of pushing at that to see if you came out with anything else  but I mean I totally agree. We looked at those remotes  I mean they are kind of anonymous  very similar looking things. This would definitely be different enough  I just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more Well the thing is the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce  that if in a year's time we we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming I mean it's so easy for us to just produce that and it can be slipped on  which is another beauty of it. Mm  so can I just recap uh Sarah  for the decisions that we've made  kinetic charging  the watch-type batteries  um L_C_D_ display on th the top side of the flip top  rubberised buttons on the bottom side  we're gonna use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover  the case itself is plastic. That's how far we've got  what else do we have to add to our decisions here? Mm. Yes  it was just  there was just a cost issue with that  but it's a good idea we just need to check on the cost  is that right? And incorporating the company logo? Mm. 'Cause I took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report  it's not just a case of having a little R_R_ hidden somewhere  they do want it to be obvious that it's our product don't they? Since it's the only one of its kind on the market it's obviously gonna be ours. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Did we I know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper  I think that was you talked about a beeper for a location  have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then? You got to go through. ,The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting. The industrial designer discussed different options for batteries  materials  and components  as well as restrictions involved in combining particular materials  components  and batteries. The team then discussed and decided what materials  components  and what type of battery to use in their product. The interface specialist presented examples of existing remotes on the market with good and bad layouts and stated what features the remote required. The marketing expert discussed research from trendwatching reports  finding that products now require technological innovativeness  a fancy look and feel  a spongy feel  and a fruit and vegetable theme. This lead to a discussion on whether to use Bluetooth or infra-red technology in remote. The team then discussed how to incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme into the remote. 
Uh yeah. Fine now. Oh  it's not liking us  it went that-a-way. Computer adjusting. Oh. Uh. Okay. So. Right. You ready back there? Uh okay. Welcome everyone. Um this is the kick-off meeting for the day. Um we're the new group uh to create a new remote control for Real Reaction. As you can see our agenda is to open up the meeting  um become acquainted with each other  um have a little training on tools  uh create a plan  discuss things and and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total. Okay. The new remote control is to be original  trendy and user-friendly. That  Steph  is your part  is the user-friendliness. The originality um is gonna take all of us. Um the trendiness we'll probably go look at for some marketing research information from you  Sarah. Um and we'll get on with it. Okay  so we'll have a functional design individual work um with meeting and then conceptual design t and then detailed design. Okay? Right. Everybody's supposed to try out the whiteboard. Kate  why don't you try it first  if you can either bring your things with you  I guess And while you're doing that we'll try and figure out how to hook these things on as well  'cause we're all gonna have to be able to walk around. Uh I do not think so  I think it's just to try out the whiteboard. Ah. Uh-huh. Okay. Great. And the characteristics? Uh-huh. Okay. Fantastic. Since you're handy as well  why don't you do yours next  Steph. I think it's to get us used to using the pen. Uh no. A mouse-y? Oh. Argh. Rat. Not a mouse  a rat. And your favourite characteristics of that animal. Oh. Okay. Kate? Oh  a fish. Oh  okay. Fine. Favourite characteristics? 'Kay. So they have team elements. I'm afraid I'm with Steph. And I think your pen's running out of whatever. But I'm afraid I take the coward's way out  and the cat's looking the other way. He's hiding. Um cats are sometimes very independent. My parents had cats. Uh and they can mm decide for themselves what is best. Okay. Now um we have to get down to the nitty-gritty of how to make this and this remote control has to be sold um we're to sell it for twenty five Euros  with a profit aim ultimately of fifty million Euros. That tells you something about how many um we have to sell on an international scale. Um would be an awful lot of these  would be like what  a hundred million of them um to make twenty five Euros on each one and to make a total profit of fifty million. Um the production is to only cost twelve and a half Euros per item. Now if they cost twelve and a half  you're selling it for twenty five  you're making twelve and a half Euros each. Um and we're to make a profit of fifty million  that's t uh can you do the maths and how many are we selling? Mark-up? Okay. Yes  'cause our market um is international and your problem is has to do with marketing of you know  you gotta know how many we're going to be selling to know how big a market you have to target and who is that. To give you a pretty good idea of where you're looking. Something like that? Okay. That's fifty million Euros. In order to make fifty million Euros  and you're only getting twelve and a half each That's a lot of selling. Two four To be fifty  be four million. You'd have to sell four million. Okay? Right. Experience with a remote control. Any of you use of remote control for a television or D_V_D_ or something? You're both nodding  all three. Well I've seen some remote controls that are for more than one device at a time  but I also have heard about them not working well or not well co-ordinated and you wind up working with this one for thi this three and then this one over here for another. And they don't always talk to each other. Don't know. Okay. Are there any um ideas for the remote? What would it be for and what group would be be for? We have to think about that one. Okay. Mm. Okay. Yeah. Um I know this sounds like it was very quick  but the I think that's the industrial design is the first one  that's Kate  for the working design. And user  that's you S Steph  for the technical functions design  and for marketing the user requirements specification. I think there's going to be a lot of we have to help each other and work through this as a group  and I think we all  you know  we like our kitty-cat and our rat and our fish  but I think we all have to like each other um to get this done. Uh as it says  we're gonna get individual instructions  but uh I don't think they allowed a lot of extra time  so I think a little bit of less of this and more at do will set us in good stead. Do you all agree? Alright. Um then I don't see any reason to prolong it and f we should finish this meeting at ni right now and go into other things. Alright  so this is the end of the first meeting. Thank you all. Are we all gonna draw a cat? That's not a mouse-y  no. It's a ratty. A ratty. It's clothes. That's it's clothes. It's a ratty with a with a with a very long tail. I love whiskers. Uh they're intelligent and they're cheeky and uh fantastic pets and very friendly. And they sit on your shoulder and whisper the answers to your homework in your ear when you're doing your homework. A shark? It is true that you always sit around you know  you're sitting on your sofa and you wanna change something  there's five different remotes  and one for the D_V_D_ and one for the video and one for cable and one for whatever else. But I presume this is t I presume this is just for television. I think one in b bright colours would be good. I think one that doesn't have lots of superfluous functions. Like I've got one at home that has well  apart from the obvious  channels  channel up  channel down  volume  you know  subtitles  mute  there's a lotta buttons that I've got no idea what they do  like. Mm. Ooh  closing the meeting. That was quick. Mm-hmm. Is this okay? I know. Thanks. Mm this is very representational fish. Um I like them because they're sleek and they have a lot of freedom but they also do n uh swim in groups  so. Do you have a favourite one? Uh yeah. I was just wondering if that's the um If fifty percent is normal B yeah. Um I would think would be more like sixty percent. But um let me I have two thoughts. One hundred  fifty percent. And and your question is how many do we have to sell? At twenty five. Mm-hmm. Yeah  that's um So that's four million of them? Yeah. And if we make Mm-hmm. Yeah. Four million. Hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Y yeah. We could make a Hello Kitty themed remote. Yeah. We could totally go for the Japan-a-mation. Well I mean there's also the cachet that um uh the Japanese make great products. Electrical their industrial design is very good. Yeah. Well  that's a really good point  because I think one of the things that being somewhat computer literate  we tend to um go to menus and then make choices  you know  so if it's like an uh volume button  you know  you can go in and say mute or or volume. We don't need to have like the l the numbers if we also have uh uh channel up channel down. Mm. We can make it smart like an iPod  you know  make everything menus. Okay. Uh yeah  if I can pick up with all these bits and pieces  hang on. Uh right  so you want an animal and the characteristics of that animal. Do you have to be able to recognise what animal it is? Um Only animal I could thin I could draw. Its a sort of bunny rabbit cat. You can tell it's not a bunny rabbit by the ears. Um I suppose it should have a mouth as well  sort of Right  yeah. Um the favourite characteristics of the cat um the whiskers I think  um because they're the easiest to draw. In fact  I'll give it some more Oh  and the tail Yes. Um sure it's not to test our artistic It's a mouse. No it's not a mouse. It's a wombat. A what? A webbed foot. Webbed f Oh right. Gosh  why didn't I think of fish? That's even easier to draw than cat. That that that's the sorta product we're talking about  one that will work for a in a home environment  for a T_V_s and I think one that works would be good. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. ,The project manager opens the meeting  stating that it is about conceptual design. He restates the last meeting's descision that they will not do speech recognition technology but says they still have to decide whether to use an LCD screen. Then they move on to the three presentations. The marketing expert is first to present  and he talks about making a pleasant-looking device  particularly one that favors current trends. They then begin talking about using a fruit  vegetable  or natural object as the shape of the remote  the logo  or for the buttons. Eventually they decide to make the device the shape of a banana. Next  the user interface specialist presents. He annouces that the technology division of their company has developed an integrated programmeable sample speaker unit  which would allow a person to have a conversation with the remote control. They have the option of using that technology. He shows them his plan what the remote control could look like and the features it might have. He suggests putting two scroll wheels- one for changing the channel and another for the volume. He also included a turbo button for speed  which he thinks every design should have. Since they can only charge twenty-five euro they decide to eliminate the LCD screen idea. After that the interface specialist talks about having a base station for the purpose of finding the remote control when lost. The user could simply press a button on the base station and the remote control would start beeping. Lastly  the industrial designer presents  discussing the power source of the remote control. He suggests that they could have one of two kinds of power supplies- the usual batteries or rechargable ones if there is to be a base station and they could place solar cells on top for times when the lighting is good. He talks about using plastic with elasticity so that the remote would not break into pieces if it fell  which relates to their earlier discussion about giving it a spongy design. Plastic is also less costly than other options of wood or titanum. In addition  he talks about giving the control a double curve  curves on both the sides so that it is easy to hold and handle. They do not yet seem set about the idea of making it a banana shape  and one group member feels that the shape is not handy. The industrial desiger tells them they will use a regular chip rather than the advanced one since pricing is a factor. They agree on having base station with the remote. They go on to have discussion  with one member suggesting that they make the banana more stylized so that it looks less like a banana- for example  it could be silver. After that the project manager has them discuss/reiterate the decisions made during the meeting:  no LCD screen  the remote will have a base station  a RF for beeping  a button on the base station to press  possibly a stylish banana-shape for the control  2 scroll wheels to control the volume and channels at the thumb level  a turbo button perhaps underneath the device  on/off button for the TV. 
Uh fourth meeting. Some extra deciding. Well I'll show you the notes again. Very interesting. Well you'll you two will uh present us your prototype. Then um I guess that's your bit? I I didn't s see anything about it  so I already uh thought you uh you were to do that. So the you're uh. I'll show you how we're going to do with financing this uh design. And then we'll evaluate  after after we have redesigned it. Because uh well we'll see about the costs. Um we'll uh evaluate our p our uh production and then uh we can close. Well the finance uh we'll do later  so um firstly uh I'll show you the notes. I don't think it's very interesting. Oh nei. Uh no. Alright. This is copy paste. So Of course. You had some very strange layout. Well um We ge we went through the agenda  and well we had some uh some presentations from you three. And uh I summarised what you said to us. So uh I don't think it's very interesting and go through it again. So uh This is what we decided. It's also copy paste from what we made together. So we still know that. And then uh we can we can uh use the time better. Well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us. Yeah. Correct. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah  alright. Okay. Yeah. Alright. Mm-hmm. Alright. So 'Kay. Well if I look at it  the side the side view Oh yeah alright. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. Okay. W Well I see  but Well. Yeah I see it. Yes. When I look at uh when I look at this side view  I think w when I have that in my hand  it's terrible. If if you look if if this this is thick  and this is thin  th th then it that it lies over your hands. But Well what what what I what I agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle  so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker  so th then it falls over your hands. And how large is it? Well uh Well the sides I haven't seen yet  uh? They the the the the the side view  we didn't uh Yeah. No no no. Yep. Okay. Yeah well uh I think uh if you t if you three uh agree then then that's it. Yes. So uh I c I c Well  we'll we we'll do it like this. Alright  if you think that that's the way it should No No  when I I my personal taste is that I want it to fall over my hands with a thick But In the market uh No not totally. For me  I I wouldn't buy it. Let's say it like that. No Yes but Yeah  we don't know  but that's uh that's that's that's more market research. So let it be like this at uh at this moment. Okay? No  I think it's great. Comes to that later. Um you. Uh c You can uh Walter. You can do the evaluation uh criteria on this? That's more useful than just speaking. Yes. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. Yeah  we're we're not quite uh objective about this. To the customers? To potential customers who have to take this questionnaire? Nei. Oh no. I know  I know  I know. But um Well we can go  uh because of the time  uh pretty quick through this. Uh do we find it good-looking? Well we think so. Uh Yeah. Well  one. Well so it's point four. Easy to find t Two. No. I totally agree. We we have to get get on  go through this. No  not false. It's one. Well uh two? Y Well we have to go through it. Yep. Two. Well  no. We didn't implement anything about that. Well six then. Are the functions easy to learn? Well w I we do want we have a l f f less of an And the device R_S_I_ sensitive? Yeah. Ah. Yeah  but just do some We we I th I th I think this is too time consuming. Uh not not towards you  but towards this all. Th this is We you have to put it to the customers. Uh well well a bit  so four. Yes. One. And features included also one. And One. Uh those uh nine uh is the fancy-looking. Uh we still think so. Device fancy feeling. Yeah  cool man. Are there enough technology? Yeah well also we have two. Is the device easy to use? Yes we have not many buttons. Two  three. Are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented? Well in our covers  in our fronts. So yes  one. Is the material attractive? Oh okay. Okay. Is the material attractive? Well the titanium is strong  and uh the rest f uh the buttons feel soft. So I would say at least two. Okay. Well Yeah. Yes  but we we have to design much more  because there was some irritating account manager coming to me. Um Oh. Uh Yes. Well  look at the costs at this point. I had to fit it in. I twelve and a half. So Well what costs a lot? The sample spea costs four. The sample speaker  the s sensor. Kick it out. We have to go to twelve and a half. The speaker costs far  by far the most. It it isn't worth it. We could make two different versions  one with and one without. But for this So  zero. Then we go to fourteen point six. Well the titanium I don't want to lose actually. L_C_ three? Yeah hand dynamo? Y t come on  w a remote control has a battery. Well be for the L_C_D_ uh you had said. Well what what's the difference between simple and regular? What's the difference between a simple and a regular chip? And simple? Nothing. Well? Your part. What happens if we do How much do we win? One. Yeah. Well  we could say  well this special colour  that isn't that that isn't there  because the the fronts they will buy it. The special colour. Yeah  then you s then you only have one half left. Uh yeah. Yeah. Yeah? No  the advanced chip is needed to have an L_C_D_ display. Says  his Uh that was in the second meeting  I think. Well I I did single curve to Well you said s double curved  uh he  because uh I thought it's a b a bit cheaper already. We can also make it flat. But Curved? Yes  that's curved. Yes. No  it's one curve. One curve  simple. We have a big financial problem. Well  then we have two dollars less profit. Come on  if we if we if we make this fifty million  they won't hesitate to uh congratulate us  so uh By the way  we also have this one. Oh  costs nothing. That's nice. Plastic is Yes  but I just got it. Who? You want to dump the titanium? And make all plastic  then we ha then we're there. Th then you have a ugly  stupid  l ugly looking  dumb remote that that no-one would buy. No  I don't think so. Yes. And the feel  and th that it is strong  and We still we had to focus to get more people from the younger group  but not lose the one Why can't I I'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy d these days. I I'll talk to the managers. Titanium  I thi I think this this is this is e really good re remote. But Ah those those account managers  what do th d what do they know? Come on. Riot. Yes  yes. One and a half Euros. Hmm? So? Well  no it's just uh all plastic. Well alright. Huh. Four. So But then we can add the special colour? As we have money over uh left. And we still have money left. What do we want  guys? Yes. Y Oh no. Alright. Safe. So alright. Finance? Well  guys? Guys? We have to dump our titanium  and we'll hate the managers for that  but now we're going to evaluate our project  of uh project  project. Well  satisfaction on for example  are we satisfactory about our creativity? I think it's terrible that we got uh those costs at the last moment. That's really bad. But that that that's that  yeah that's a reason  but also for our creativity. We had um nice design  and then you get the cost  and you had to dump all your creativity. Yeah. Well  alright. Uh leadership next. Uh teamwork? Uh yeah well I think so also. I al I I've uh filled that in in a the questionnaires uh each time  so Well the managers were terrible. So  with their all their useless requirements. But o alright  the teamwork? No they said  oh we won't d uh we won't uh use teletext  uh we won't use the D_V_D_. Alright  teamwork? Well great I think. Uh well what do you  what did you think about the SMARTboard? Well It's also a It's both the SMARTboards. I liked this SMARTboard  but I hated that one. Well it's both a SMARTboard. No. It's both a SMARTboard  but this one is used for a desktop  and that one is used to to draw. Well  wi w which one did you like? That one. Yeah. Yes. Th that is so. We're now talking about the SMARTboards. Or install a laptop to a beamer  or have this one standing here in an I I like it. Okay  alright. Yeah. Yeah  it is. So And uh the digi the digital pen? Did uh did you like that one? I used it uh just to check it out  but uh You you can't send that to anyone  because you you've scrabbled something on a page for yourself  and then you're going to send it  yeah. Well  no. It's  no  it it's useless. Yes. For drawings  yes. But But for notes  it i you you have to put that in a strict Uh you have to put a name  standard date  and all those things. And notes uh for a meeting are very strict. So if you uh were to write them down for yourself  and then put that in your computer  you still have to type it over to Word. So it doesn't d doesn't have any Yep. Alright. Um etcetera? Well uh the laptops? Of course great. Yeah. You can. B by my Yeah. Other uh things we used here? I hated the cameras  I hated the microphones. But No No. No. I haven't looked w one time directly at the camera. I don't care about it. Well w why not? Uh etcetera We N new ideas found? What kind of ideas for n a future schedule What? For future um meetings you have got? Chatting and emailing. Well  new ideas found by this. Not. Nothing. We don't want this. We hate this. Digital pen is useless. So Yeah  for drawings. But uh two t But uh th then you have to have a lot of drawings  because if I had a company and I'm going to uh buy those expensive huge expensive uh things  I and I have to w pay those uh papers uh that are expensive  I'm not going to uh Well th then still they they they should have a a nice graphics programme on the laptop. Because this is huge uh this v very very uh expensive paper. Yeah. Well no. I hated to draw like that. You you can't draw anything uh neat. I if it if it would be perfect following. Well th th then still it's it's it's very expensive uh towards a a just a green uh school board. Yep. Yeah yeah. Yep. Yeah. Well  they are now. It is. So  congratulations crew. Se Finally my beer. Well  that's it I think. Um I don't know how long we still have. I dunno how long uh we had for this last meeting. But uh Well yeah  it is a bit uh Well we still have to make the end report and uh all those things. I have to do that. I Di did you um save this one in the folder? Can you do that? I don't know what you have to do. Yeah. Oh it worked. Two times quick. Cool. This is nice. Uh D design. S Oh. He saved them all ten. Well alright. Um Yeah. Well Where is this? I also think so. She already knows. She? Big brother. Our manager. Yeah. I don't think so. Alright. We put the fashion in electronics  but we couldn't because of the costs. That that's the title of our uh end document. We couldn't put the fashion into the electronics. Yeah  that's a nice title. Oh. Well I'm going to resign after this project anyway  so We have to do what? Oh. Mm. Bit late. I think it is. Alright. No you go and I'll uh supplement you. Yeah. Yeah  it's a double R_  but It's a double R_. But it's very difficult to to draw that in Yeah. Oval yeah. Channel up and volume? Yeah. Menu for the L_C_D_ screen. Well  at the back Yeah. No the back. With the logo and our uh l uh No I don't think And the And about the side view um This the front won't be as thick  but again th the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really uh Well  it won't be visible. Mm? Yeah. If y If you handle a remote  you you usually don't have your hand straight like this. You you have it a bit uh Yeah. Yeah. Well  they lay there all the time. Yeah yeah. Yeah you you don't you don't grab it  you you Yeah. Hmm. That way  it it falls into your hand. I think. No but but Well f for as far as I can see  three of us agree and only Nils But you're the Project Manager  you can make the hard decisions. Yeah? Mm. But what about the redesigning? Okay. Hmm. Mm. Well we designed it to be good-looking. Hmm. Yeah. We designed it to be good-looking  so Hmm. I think we shouldn't discuss any points points that long  because I don't know how how many points there are but uh Yeah. Yeah. Um  no it's uh With two huge buttons. Well it's easier to find than a a normal black one or something  because of the colour. But We have so few functions  so Yeah. Well  I should I think two  because the voice recorder is n not self learning. Yeah. Yeah. The Two two. T Yeah. One or two  another two. Well three. Mm. Yeah. This is the last meeting? Yeah. Yeah. The what? Oh. Um Well well why why why should we use a advanced chip? Yeah? Can't we do that with a regular chip? Why not? Yeah. Regular is normal. Simple. Elementary. We we we Why? We have very little options furthermore  for the Uh well we have to put that in. Nah. Yeah  you must change the chip uh back. You must change the chip back  Nils. Hmm. No we oh You you we have an advanced chip-on-print  and we have an L_C_ display. I think that's a bit double. Y we don't need both. Says. I?? One curve. Well we make it more expensive to buy. Yeah or we could replace it Why why don't we replace the titanium with uh plastic coloured titanium  uh titanium-coloured plastic? Yeah well if we uh we we have to get cheaper. But then we we've got to uh run through the eval evaluation process again. Ah no no. It's not ugly looking. The looks remain the same. Well  I do think so. feel. Yeah alright but then we we won't get there. We can dump the special colour. We l we use plastic. And plastic is already in colour I think. No  nothing. Amen. Yeah. Yeah. But No no no no. W Titanium stays there. Well No because we did not know anything about it. Yeah  but then we've got money left. Yeah. Yeah. W Well I think uh the case is double curved then. Because you y have that curve and you have that curve. Yeah well uh Well y we have curves in all directions. I mean  this this ain't titanium  but it looks like it. Pro project. Yeah. Yeah. And uh unrealistic. Well we we we used our creativity  but we just had to adapt it to the costs. Nei. Uh no. Terrible. Leadership? Well Yeah. Yeah. Right yeah. No  that's a SMARTboard  and that's a digital pen. Or not? Oh they're both SMARTboards. Yeah. But I I think this is meant by the digital pen. Yeah. Well we we used that one  and we needed it. I think. Yeah alright  but Yeah I like that one  but that one is terrible. Well I I drew this. Mm. And I made a mistake. But it it would have been uh useful  if I I could show this on the screen. Yeah for drawings. N notes mm. Mm. Yeah. But then uh it's really useful  I think. Yeah. Hmm. Thanks Project Manager. Well I did. Well I missed uh the option to uh to email  yeah. Email or chat or something. Yeah alright  but that's one n new idea. Yeah. No it isn't. Yeah. So it isn't useless. Yeah. Well you you can't you can't draw on a laptop like you like you paint of or draw with your hand. With the mouse it is No. Uh indeed. Yeah  but but then you can uh save it in instantly  and and and re-use it  and uh Hmm. Hmm. Celebration. Yeah  we can go to the bar and uh with our newly earned money. Yeah. Oh. No. No no no no. But Nils you've got some work left. I have to go to a physiotherapy. Wow. Yeah. It is handy. Well they they wanted everything we produced  so My big bird. I think you have we have to make clear to her that we are ready. Close your laptop. So she can see we're ready. Yeah. Let's take this remote into uh production. She's on the move. Yeah. Okay. Mm right. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah  I agree. It depends on the size. If it's kinda small  this is is great. But if it's it's larger  then you want to grab it. Yeah  that's the question. Yeah  I agree with the L_C_D_ screen. You have it in your palm like this  and you can watch uh watch the screen. And if you have it li in the middle  your hand might be over it. Like you're holding your telephone. Because if you have a screen on it  you wanna look at your screen. Yeah  I agree on this. No  I don't think so. That's not uh the point And you might be uh You might be target customer. Yeah. Alright. Great. Well  this is just a short intro. I'm going to do uh the ev evaluation. That's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria. So I made a I made a few questions on the hand of uh uh the impor most important requirements and trends. And we have to look if our uh if our device uh is working correctly. Well  I put some questions in a Word file. See if I can find them. Uh uh uh uh mm. Well I uh think you have all seen uh this kind of evaluation  so uh I don't have to explain it. Uh the first question is  uh is the device good-looking? Because normal p uh most people thought that um earlier devices were ugly ugly. Seventy five percent of them. So what do we think? Yeah No  I know  but I have to uh evaluate it. So I have to take this questionnaire. Yeah Yeah  but I can't can s Yeah  but uh  you know We dis we di we designed it to be perfect. So But we have to be critic critical about it. And I have to uh take all these points and get a average at the end. So we we know where we stand. 'Cause th there are some things we might have uh bi might have forgotten. Right  so Right. Uh is it good-looking? The titanium might be uh f for older people. It you put uh put a black front on it or something. Right. Right. Right  a number please. So the last one is seven. Easy to change channels? Oh  sorry. Yeah  right. Change channels? Right. The power  channel and volume buttons are easy accessible? Two? Alright. The uh device is easy to find if you lose it? Yeah. Six? Right. Yeah  I agree. Yeah. Alright. Two? Yeah Yeah  I agree. No. Yeah. Right  R_ R_S_I_ sensitive? R_S_I_ sensitive? Four. Um Yeah. Right. Yeah  that's great. Well  with the uh Three. Nah f four I think. If you look at this No. Three  alright. Yeah  that's true. But Right. The average will uh come later. It has to go to twelve  right? Twelve and a half. Out. That's easy. Kick it out. Yeah. The speaker. That's some wrong info  man. No. It's uh It's just extra. Kick it out. What more? Batteries are uh quite Uh no  no no no. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah  we need to have the the L_C_D_ screen. No Yeah  but No  that's n It's not relevant. Yeah. No  Then the whole concept is uh You You can make you can make it cheaper. But if you don't sell No no no no. If if you make people brand-aware  they are willing to pay more. But Because we we use a brand at the front and uh I dun at the back. If you have uh lots of uh marketing people might buy. If you if you make it cool to have Oh  that's just great. Oh  alright. That is pretty stupid. Y Yeah  I agree. I don't think you should dump the L_C_D_ screen. Or you shou It's Or change the titanium or dump the L_C_D_ screen. But I think you could better change uh titanium to hard a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium than lose the L_C_D_ screen. Because you have lots of functions in it too. Yeah  I agree. Osl If you don't have the money  you can't make it. So s If you don't have the money  you can't make it. So this is too expensive. So we have to make it cheaper. Right. It's just free  man. Yeah right. I want chrome. Well  th that that is the problem. Yeah. Shoot. Yeah. Yeah  me too. Right. Leadership. Well it's It was very democratic. Yeah yeah. Well Yeah  think so too. Yeah  I don't like it. Yeah? This this this isn't a SMARTboard  right? Yeah right. B but you This is just a large t large television. You u you use the Yeah  but you ca This is just a beamer function. And here  on this one  you can uh draw the pictures and things like that. But That one. That one isn't accurate. It just doesn't work. You can Yeah  but I think there's a big distinction between the these th I don't need a SMARTboard. Yeah  but give me a beamer. That's uh that's much uh much cheaper. Right. Yeah. I agree. No. Yeah. Yeah. It isn't practical. Right. Your notepad. Yeah. Yeah  it might be useful for drawings. I I agree on that. Yeah  right. That Stefan use. No  I don't think so. It's it's only useful if you have to draw something. Yeah. Yeah  great. Yeah. Wireless uh wireless things. Well these chairs  man. Really great. Communicate in between. Yeah  right. Yeah. Yeah  I agree. Well  more more information in the beginning. That's For people who uh sketch th the whole day  I can imagine that it's useful. Well Yeah  I agree. Mouse is ju just isn't working if you're sketching. Yeah  but he's saying if it is correct  and you can draw very  yeah  very precise Yeah  mu It saves time. Celebration. Well Yeah. You better get started. Huh. Oh  alright. Oh great  man. I'm gonna buy one buy one for my bedroom. Maybe you are broken. You know. I think she's listening. I feel watched. Yeah. Do that. Yeah. Very catching. I'm sure management would like that. Oh  that's just great. W what? Alri alright. We'll see. Yeah. Yeah  that's important too. Yeah. Alright. From me of course  yeah. Well from us all  yeah  from all of us. Yeah. It's a nice chorus  yeah. Repeat it yeah. Alright. Alright  we both uh will? Or one of us will? Uh Alright. If I make mistakes uh you'll uh Right. Uh well this is our design. Uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting. With uh the different uh perspectives of it. Uh we'll begin uh with the front. We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape. Um with uh the upper part being the front. Th So there's this part um which is made of hard plastic  the front. And uh we're we're using different colours. Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours  and later we'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything. But basically  different colours  bright colours not black  too dark. Fancy colours. Um then we have uh the lower part of the of the device. Uh which is of course um part of the back actually  because it's also titanium. You can see it also on the on the on the side view  that only this part is the front  and the rest of it  the under uh the under side uh of it  yeah  the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium  and has the titanium colour of course  the look. Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner  uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back  part of the titanium uh titanium part. Yeah? It's a double R_. Yeah the logo Uh uh it's difficult to draw so small  but it's our double R_ uh logo is in there. Um so that's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner. Then we have the buttons. Uh it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons. So uh oval  n those are here. And then we have the m The m Yeah the the con the the the  yeah  the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here. Um um with kind of arrow shapes  which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh uh square buttons. And also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on. We have the Okay button. Oh nei we uh the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators  of the channel and uh volume um changers. And then we've here the Menu button and the And the video button. The Yeah. And of course this low part  this is the L_C_D_ screen. Uh this is what we made of it. You can make uh suggestions uh if you want. Maybe we maybe we should finish first uh our talk and then you can add suggestions. Maybe I I don't want to I don't want to suppress you but n I'll uh finish this uh quick. Um okay I've had everything I guess on the front? Yeah the back. Yeah. We thought about Yeah  uh the back is of course totally titanium. And we thought about the logo big in the middle. Just so again the double R_. We have then the logo on front and on the back. Maybe that's too much but you have to say uh say that if you think that way. And the company slogan  we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo. That's basically what we were thinking about  and Oh and uh before I forget. Yeah the the voice  of course  the voice recorder is uh at the bottom. And you can record it uh using  yeah  the the the back of the f w device. Why? Well it fits uh it it it it fits the hand  mean uh the the the the In the middle in the That's the question. Uh well Yeah. H What do you suggest I mean we do? This was Mike's prototype  and y you seemed to agreed on it. But now you have a totally different. The size? Yeah well the size doesn't really matter w I mean Side? Uh oh the side? W we we he drew the s the side  but you d you weren't paying attention as usual. Well any case  we'll discuss it now. Uh I think uh this is a pretty good uh good idea. But you you hold it like this. You're not holding it like this or something. You  yeah  y How do you call it? Yeah. Well y y y you don't have it like this. You have it more like this. You you you're using buttons this way  or if you're right-handed  this way. So you Yeah. So Yeah well And maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher  so Well Well the the Well that's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen uh of course on the upper side  but If necessary. But uh are d Can you live with it? Uh Y Yeah  y y y y you said it was totally uh unusable. But do you But d you don't think this is completely unusable I guess. I think. Not totally  well Yeah but of course y you are also human. We have to take uh every everyone into account. So Yeah. Well uh who who else thinks like you? We don't know. Maybe a thousand people  or a million people. Let it be. Alright. So that's that. Uh any other suggestions? You're very personal again. Well d we designed it  so of course we are very Yeah. So and we ha we have answer now? Yeah. I Yeah  I think it Well l well let's start with the beginning  just one by one. Well  I guess uh I think uh it's uh it's it's um pointed towards the youth of course  uh if you look at the design and and the colours and everything. That was our target audience of course. But it's also not completely um uh u unacceptable for older people I guess. Uh it's it's not f a device that Yeah  that's that's uh for older people  it's it's more that classical look. So Uh no. I think Yeah they like black of course  but I think they'll uh they they think uh the the titanium look of it is also Uh I think it's also good for them  so I think we both uh have uh consider considered uh the youth and also a bit older people. So I think it's very good-looking and not only for youth uh young people. Yeah  the fourteen yeah. Is it easy to t change channels? Yeah well I think so. I think it's uh as easy as uh can be made. Uh So I Yeah. You How can you make it any easier? Yeah  huge is a Yeah. D we d we don't we don't have uh that s Yeah. Well we don't have the device that beeps uh when you lost it or so  but um um Yeah. Yeah. Mm? Are we take too much time? Yeah  very much. One. Yeah. And I think fancy-feeling too  because of the titanium back. Yeah. So well maybe two because of the voice recorder. F Yeah. One or two. Yeah. Four? Well  it doesn't really resemble any fruit  uh that's true. But but we have the the the the the sparkly fruity colours of course. And you can also have front with uh with fruit on it. I knew things uh were going uh too smoothly. There had to be some kind of trouble along the way. My god. The what? The Yeah w tha that's uh that's a bit an optional option. No. No  d th No. Yeah. No. N Uh well we have a bit of a problem I think. Because uh the L_C_D_ screen. Yeah. No. Because uh that uh y because my information says it. Huh? Uh well yeah I I read something about it  but Yeah  I I read something about it  but it wasn't very clear. I d I didn't in include it in my report. Single Well you have to use a chip. So Well you have to use the advanced chip  if you have the L_C_D_ screen. But if you have a regular chip  you can't have the L_C_D_ screen. That that's a fact. Uh Yeah  but it's only one half. Uh it d it doesn't But we d Then we have to lose the L_C_D_ screen. Yeah  I know but that's what my information says. I di I didn't uh put uh the advanced chip in there for fun. You have to use it. For the L_C_D_ screen. Yeah. Yeah. Well uh and what do they mean with curves uh again? Because we you have uncurved Yeah. Well But what what did what do n Sorry  but What do they mean with the curves? Is th Is this a curve? One curve? Yeah  this is actually two curves  yeah. It's how you It's how you look at it. Well then we have a huge problem I think. W t we can never get uh below the twelve and a half. But uh I Hey but uh I think you'll agree that uh that we that now we have this uh screen  it's it's very uh not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing. Well that's pretty uh l N not very practical. Well But I'm n I don't agree. I think I think the titanium just uh provided the the tough look and the and the And also the the older people will like it because of that. And because i Alright it's not our target audience  but it's it's useful if it's uh important for old people. Yeah. I think the titanium is very important. Yeah we have a problem  yeah. W But you can better  yeah  dump the L_C_D_ screen then. Well what else? W I mean uh Yeah. Yeah  well yeah. Alright. I agree with that. So we u we use uh Unfortunately. Um. Titanium-coloured plastic. So titanium-coloured plastic for the back. Yeah this is good  but it it's not good enough. So we have to use the ditch the titanium  I'm afraid. What do we Well what do we know? All we want is a is a fancy design but we don't really consider the costs. So Yeah al alright  yeah. But we have to deal with it now. So So Titanium gone and add plastic. And on plastic times two and then we uh are there? No No yeah well Oh six. A lot of plastic  yeah. No two for the to make it clear. I want gold plating. No no um We have we have to uh fill W we ha No no no  but th that's not f um Well you can you can double curve  if you don't have titanium. And that we dropped  so it it can be done. But it's pretty funny. We we do want to reach twelve point five. But it isn't bad to to to stay at eleven. We get more salary  if we make if cheaper than twelve uh twelve and a half. Objection. Well I can't get no satisfaction  but uh I think it's uh Well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best  yeah. Its it's uh ridiculous actually  but Which isn't very practical  but that's the way. Uh-huh. Well uh they they didn't think of the requirements. It's the requirements of the user  uh I guess. Yeah. Yeah but they base that on on the user specifications. It was a complete disaster. No Uh it it it uh it is uh No it's other way around. That's the SMARTboard. That's the digital panel. That's that's the smart A televi Yeah. Yeah. Left or right? Well I didn't use uh Nei It it's much m But uh you can uh I I sent it about three times now. Uh a green uh board with uh chalk is much more useful than that thing. The simple uh sch school board. I I didn't use it. I wrote things down but I didn't import it into my laptop. That's the W But also y you write things down. And i you can also bring your your your note block. So what's the what's the th what's the point of importing it into Yeah alright. For drawings  but not for personal notes. I think that's not very Uh I mean you can bring your paperwork along and p Well of course if you have a lot of paper If you've If you've Yeah I understand. But I think uh d this option is only useful if you've got a lot of paperwork. You can't It's not very uh ni Yeah well a lot of documents are Yeah. Mu Yeah right. Can we keep them? Uh. Well did you really uh Did you really take uh take those in account? I half of time I didn't notice they were there. So But we shouldn't talk about that. Because this is a realistic environment. Right. Okay. But yeah. W well th that's just the the environment they set us up f with. So Well  for drawing for drawings. Yeah. Well No But it's still an expensive uh expensive But if w Yeah. Well and if And but what if uh maybe this this board uh SMARTboard is malfunctioning or someone. But suppose it was working correctly  what uh would it be useful then  if it wasn't off all the time? A Really? Anything you want. Any b b Yeah. L li li Yeah. Well it isn't  but maybe that thing is uh is Yeah  board  a school board  yeah. Yeah. I it has It is useful. Yeah. This uh if it works correct  maybe this thing this thing is just malfunctioning. So uh if we get in uh if we get another one and you make sure it does work  I think then it's pretty useful. Because uh yeah you can draw t things quickly and uh clearly for anyone uh in the discussion room. And then you can save it immediately. Did you type that? Maybe till four o'clock or something? Well dunno. Yeah. No we must save this thing  yeah. In the shared map map. Map  is it a good word? The folder  yeah. So it is useful  yeah. No but uh Radical. Yeah. Do you believe it yourself? They also want to see my cat and his rabbit  and uh Your big beautiful bird. Maybe the pen is just uh uh broken and the board isn't. Of or the other way around uh Yeah I think so too. Who is she you're talking about? Oh you mean our uh coach  our f personal coach. Is she also our accountant? Is she responsible for sending that information so late? Oh. Because then we have to confront her with our Yeah. That that's our new slogan. Yeah  I like that. Blame our accountants. But we couldn't  yeah. Well I th Yeah. ,The Industrial Designer gave her components concept presentation  which presented the components that will be used and how they will be integrated into the functional design. She announced that their only choice for casing material was wood  so she suggested an idea of having customizable wood cases. The User Interface Designer gave her presentation on the user interface concept for the product  and gave a basic layout of the remote's key functions. The Marketing Expert presented the marketing concept and discussed including a display to facilitate use. The group discussed the unique  custom design of the remote  and quickly talked about finding a manufacturer that could make the custom cases cheaply that still paid fair wages. The group also discussed whether or not to incorporate the display into the design  and decided to wait until the cost of adding that feature was known before adding it to the design. The Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer were instructed to begin building a prototype  and the Marketing Expert was instructed to work on the marketing strategy as well as research the cost of the display component. 
So we come again for the the second meeting. Uh for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about uh the work for each one. And take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control. And we have think I got a new project requirement. So I think uh teletext becomes outdated. So the popularity of the since the popularity of the internet  and I think we don't need lighting adaptive  so the remote control should be only used for the the television. And of course we should have our image in the in the design. So  let's start with the the industrial designer.. Or y you can use the whiteboard if you want. Here. Oh okay. This one. Do you want to open Ah. Wow. This. You can i yeah. Ma Yeah we can change the b. Yeah. Um. It's mine. Participant one  no? Mm. Oh we have so let's move to to user interface design. Participant During the weekend. That's good. Mm-hmm. This are usual functionality. Tasks. And they are small. Mm-hmm. Yeah. What do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the T_V_ than the So we should have specific T_V_? Or? We can use this. Yeah  we don't Yeah  I think so. J j just the remote control. Mm. Yeah  we. Yeah. Speech recognition. Keep the navigation but. So you are Mm. How the this remote? Yeah  of course small. Participant four. So Harry. Mm-hmm. But do you think what they sug suggested s possibility. Yeah. It Yeah. But is it useful or not u I don't know. There is in the Mm. I think i If it's necessary can you can do that. We can integrate small microphone in the remote so it's not really a problem. What about lighting adaptive options? According to the re to the new requirements I think we don't need that. Yeah. Mm. So we have I think we have s still we have couple of minutes. Mm-mm. So any things to to discuss? Or any suggestions? Expensive. Price. I think we we can we is the. Yeah. So you have to anticipate the the future?. In future. Okay. So let's go for the the lunch break  and we will meet after. Just go to explorer. Or open. Participant two. Open uh. Slide show  view slide show . One is a communication. Gateway arrays. It's a field programmable gateway arrays. Yeah. Or it's something like isn't hardware the first one? And the second one is for the software. Yeah to run th to make it run. That's it. No. Okay  and how about the battery power? Uh you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared? Into the more compact and uh okay . Yeah  yeah. Okay. Yeah  that's right. Having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always. People don't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out. We just make a small charger and put it Bu Our remote  we do not want to make it P_D_A_. G Yeah  not the T_V_s. Yeah. Yeah  that's right. Yeah  that's right. Oh  but you have a catch there  um assume that um if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine  then. Uh-huh huh huh huh. Mm-hmm hmm hmm. But Yeah then yeah that's right. Mm hmm hmm. Okay. Okay. too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it. Yeah  that's. just give it a name and we call him. Yeah  that's right. Yeah  that's right. Okay  after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface  I think most of the points which I want to are already covered here. And to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested  then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines  and the users send the feedbacks  and based on that These are the findings which we got and yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a T_V_ remote but the technology We already know that as discussed earlier An it does how feasible it is. Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones. We just have the it's not going to take much space also. It's going to be very slim. And next one was the size of the remote control. It has to be of course a very slim and small one. And of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive  so this is an important criteria here is I mean we have to look for a trade-off. The features and the cost. Little bit more if it's with extra features. Okay. Yeah  yeah. That's right. I mean  for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes. Or they say movie name or I don't go for movie names but only for the numbers on the channel  or volume up  volume down  brightness  contrast. So  I think this should be a good idea  to put this features. And the fourth one was the teletext in various languages. Mm  I think Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting  but I think uh not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required. I mean I mean yeah  it's for the um industrial design and users interface designers to decide if it's going to be working or not. I think I think as I discussed th that four points would be good for um marketing. The speech interface and uh less uh reasonable uh cost. And the lighting adaptation and the teletext. And regarding the teletext uh these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions. If you are watching an foreign movie  you get subtitles sometimes. And uh if you are a French guy watching an English movie you would like to have it in French. And if I am a German then I would like to have the my options in German. So  the remote it should have some it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages. That should be a good uh point. We already have some. Yeah  that's right. Yeah . Okay  thank you. Okay. Okay. Yeah  alright. So uh Well I have a PowerPoint pr presentation stored in my in my personal folder so I I I think you can reach it from here. Participant two. Yeah. Uh open. Right  so um I will talk about the the w working design and And um well I I will present my my first idea on how to build the our new remote control for television. So uh can you go one page down  please. So I think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve uh what we want to do. So uh mm I'm thin uh I think uh I I'll do a survey about what is uh what is available on the market and what what is the the cheapest possible things we hav we can use. Then uh I will try with the technical team to to build a prototype and to see uh with uh h how this little box would uh look look like. And how an and we can uh start troubleshooting first uh com communication problems or things like that. And when we are ready with this first prototype I I think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or um things like that. Okay so can you go down uh So  wha what I think for now is we don't want to have a remote control w which is wired so uh I think we u we can use a battery for the. Then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication. And the communication with the T_V_ set is uh made through uh infrared communication So uh this is the the schema of the o of the future uh remote controls so uh you can you can see the components  uh battery and uh the two chips goes to the infrared uh connection to the T_V_ set. The one on top is for the um well the functionali the functionalities and the the th red um sorry the green one is is to well  putting things together  um f transform the data into uh qu into the format to to uh to communicate with the T_V_ set. And  that's it. I think we should use a F_P_G_A_ for for the functionalities which is easy to to t It's field programmable uh something array. Yeah. Well  uh a F_P_G_A_ is just a chip you can uh you can pr programme it uh wi with wh whatever you want. And uh well the Bluetooth chip is just responsible to uh make the communication uh between uh the two devices. No. Well  th the F_P_G_A_ will produce the the data to send. Yeah. Yeah. Alright and that's it for the working design. So if you have any questions? Uh no no no no  I think uh we have uh to to uh have uh embedded uh b batteries in in the yeah into the t. Yeah  yeah. And uh I I don't think it will need um very uh much power to make it run  so Yeah. It's a good idea. Yeah. That's a good idea. Also  but but I I I think uh the the goal is to sell our remote control. S okay  so charger for is the. Yeah. Of course. So we have to t We have to sell a T_V_ with the remote control too. I think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the T_V_ set on recorders or thing like that and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because Yes  that's a good idea  I think. We d we don't we we don't need really much buttons to i if we have a screen to navigate on on the T_V_ so uh Well  f four five buttons  it's sufficient. It's easy to build  it does not consume much power. Well  then y you you go to the main menu and uh you have uh go to channel and then uh you can Yeah. Maybe you. but uh I I think i i if you if you want to to make uh well a a big jump but uh well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could Well  not a mouse but uh something that that says more clearly that uh right  left  up  down  well  the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator  maybe directly  or So  we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that. But we'll see. Okay  so uh next presentation Mm. Well I I think it will be a  yes  a bit complicated to um make a speech recognisers runs on the small uh ts Yeah. And this can allow to choose the the program  for instance without uh adding uh buttons so it's a good idea. Yeah. Yeah  s s speech is a important extra feature I think Well  uh Well  we are we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or uh well yes a microphone into the the remote control  so I well it will be alright. Yeah. Okay. Yeah  I think it's a bit complex too For our next product  our new T_V_ set with uh automatical uh sound adjustment light. Function. Yeah  but well what about the the new project's requirement? I I I think we should give up with teletext  no? Yes. Well  so maybe we we can j we can already think uh about a way to to access the internet via the television. Because if Yeah  but uh we can think that in a few years there will be T_V_ set that can access the internet. So it's a good idea if i i if we i if if we uh think about how to to to build up our remote uh control w with this functionality in a w which will c which will come in a few years. So if we already have it in our remote control Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  to desi well  not not to implement it  but to well  to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a yeah  in an in an easy manner  if is possible. Yeah  yeah. Okay. So Okay  thank you. Mm-hmm. Okay. Because it's open you mean. F_ five. Did you draw it? This. What is the other chip for? The one on top. For men. To the in Okay. Mm. What is F_P_G_A_? So why's it how is it different from the Bluetooth? Yeah. Programme it. Okay. Yeah. Uh So this are the they have to work together? Or? Do they have to work together or two separate choice Okay. Is the is the software par alri okay. Okay  okay. So you can control if you want  right? Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. You can put it on the charger when uh you when you don't need to use it. Yeah. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Mm. Uh mm. Y yeah  yeah. Because you are using because you are using Bluetooth  if some people have P_D_A_ they can use their P_D_A_ to control the T_V_ if they want to  right? I dunno. So is mine. Oh. Yeah  this your Yeah. So you can open uh three. Yeah. So So I'm working on the technical functions design. can you show the next slide. So the the purpose is to to find uh the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have. So so I found on a webs on the internet yeah. I spent a lot of time searching and uh and I found that uh the function of remote control is to send messages to television set. For example switch on  switch off  switch the next channel and so on and so on. So I found two very good prototypes for for this interface from our competitors so can you Yeah  yeah  yeah. Ours is a bit uh different. So these are two example. One is from the other one is from  yeah  uh engineering centr yeah. This is the most competing prototypes I've found. But then uh loo but then I found if you look at you see on the left one there are too many buttons Yeah. O on the right I tried to play with the problem is that uh if I have hundred channels I have uh I have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and I have to compose the number so it's very lousy. So you so you move to the next the next one. Yeah  so I talk about the problem. And then I I look at the user manual they are a hundred pages thick  so we don't want that. So I propose the easy to use uh prototype. You can navigate on T_V_ screen and we can the user's preference and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_ and we need some to do some preprocessing. From the technical aspect  the processing should be done on the T_V_ set than on the on the remote controller  right? And then we the speech recognition as uh Harry says we may just put in we may K_I_V_. Yeah  all the processing is done the T_V_ is a compu has some processing power the Yeah. Yeah because are you just wondering what controller okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. So i the processing on on the remote controller so it can u be used in any T_V_  any conventional T_V_ sets? Mm. Okay. N yeah  that's all. The next one? So I come up with a simple design  just keep the v navigation buttons. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Okay  that's all. Mm. Mm. No  because you choose by channel  so you choose by T_V_ program so you don't have hundred channels to choose from. If you go by channel  you don't have to do that. Ah. Ah  a big jump. A mouse or Yeah. Mm. Mm-hmm. Uh it's gonna be small. Yeah. So it'll beep if you wanna find it you just uh shout y h just it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device. I dunno how bu And responds to you  and I- mm. But I think if you to recognise numbers it's a well-studied problem. I if you just recognise uh numbers is a limited you have limited vocabulary Mm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. But Mm. Yeah. I no I I think that uh i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with uh reasonable cost. Maybe not less  but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort  yeah  extra features. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. What is the teletext? Mm. It is interesting but we are only concerned with the remote controller. So you need s special T_V_ sets to do that? Or it's it's done via this remote controller? It's very complex. Mm. Yeah  then we can conclude that. Yeah. Yeah  but it's quite possible but maybe not in this project. Mm. Mm. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Mm. Mm. Using the T_V_ to access the internet? Or what? I didn't quite understand Yeah  okay. Yeah. The future demand  market demand. The functionality in the future. Alright. Yeah. Because all the T_V_ sets will be digital  right. All the programmes  everything will be in digital than analog. Th the system will change and we have to anticipate for those change. Okay. Thank you. ,The User Interface Designer presented the basic functions of the device and discussed the designs of two existing products  showing an example of the simple design that the group wants to implement. The Marketing Expert presented feedback from users  showing that users want a simple but fancy-looking remote control and that young users want speech recognition. She discussed including only the most basic functions in the interface. The Industrial Designer presented her internal design of the device and discussed the processor chip and the energy sources that will be integrated. She suggested integrating an extra lightbulb that lit up when the remote was communicating with the television. The Project Manager gave the group new requirements for the product design. The group discussed marketing the product to a wide range of customers. They had a discussion about possibly including a locator function and speech recognition. They discussed integrating the company's yellow color and logo into the design  and decreasing the number of buttons in the main interface. The Project Manager instructed the Industrial Designer to prepare the components concept  the User Interface Designer to prepare the interface concept  and the Marketing Expert to prepare a trendwatching report. 
Think s Mm. Pro Probably not  'cause he's 'S been listening to too much. He's getting retarded. Yay. Or not. Yeah. Apparently I'm old as well. Presented by name. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die. Yeah there's a thingy and a dingy and Nah. I wanna change that. I like the kinetic. Oh interface concept. Very long presentation. Well that doesn't bo bode well for it for it tats as well. Um so  somehow that thing's too big  but um okay um our uh manufacturing division wanted the speech recognition. They say they could put it to work but um we don't think so. No. It it it you'll be you know be affected by the by the other speech and Yeah and and fighting for the remote would not be fun anymore  and I think that's one of the things we wanna keep. That kinda would r d yeah. That would kind of lose it. Yeah so um taking that away  our uh the the the rubber but rubber buttons are the more reliable it's the the ones that would al would allow us to to market our product as being you know less prone to damage and more resistant to things like spillage of liquids over it or you know mistreat misuses as it happens to remote controls. Um as for the point that we making about losing it. Well  we wanna small r remote control one side because uh we want it to be cool and uh designed  but um apparently um market shows that bigger s bigger um remotes get less lost  about But um yeah I think we we need to compromise between those two and somehow we'll do that. Somehow. Um so the the what I would propose is something more or less in the uh direction of what is to yo the right of that slide uh but without with a l a less complicated um design  so the numbers  the volume control  and channel control  and teletext access. Uh the volume and channel control can just become those the the four button array as in if it was a round dial. And um if you just think about it as the one to the right but with the numbers and the four buttons plus maybe a centre one with teletext. Ye no it's not i i it's just four buttons that are on a cross  so that you ba basically can control all of the important tasks from that alone. Yeah um yeah so I think we w we go for something mid-sized  so something looks good and uh is not too prone to get lost. That be it.. But would we I dunno. I'll bet first in volume maybe. I dunno. It's only a T_V_. Hmm. Mm-hmm. No it's just different. Maybe not. S Yeah. Yeah I think we have like and it's not very usable and it will bring down the robustness of the whole thing  'cause it's it it breaks down easier. Mm-hmm. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Okay so we'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber  robust  with scroll wheel  with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff  favourite channels  and and with a cradle  and yeah and the locator. Or not. Okay so you can market pe depending on that? Cool. Hmm. Yeah I think it pretty much everything's covered. Coulda been worse. Yes I am. Rock and roll. So do we need to re-train Mike on how to put his mic on? Okay  can he get it all by himself this time? So I believe I can fly. Just what I needed was something exciting. Remember  I'm an old man. Thirty's really young  eh? Jose he man is. N name. I've I just love you tech guys  huh. They just Yeah y do jabber. P Yeah. I I gotta I gotta flashlight  and uh yeah but it's interesting 'cause you shake it like this. Like this. And that's on the camera. Yeah. I g I I figured you would. Yes. Yeah. It it it Uh. Uh uh to me in a marketing sense it's not it's not relative. We can we can o we can uh accentuate whatever whatever product you put in there we can find a way to accentuate it. And if you make it from that super rubber  when you drop it on the floor it can bounce right back up in your hand. You don't even need to lean down to get it. Mm-hmm yeah that's yeah that's what I see. Yeah that's what I see also. Ooh. That's right. Mm-hmm. I dunno. Trend watching I guess. Trend watching I believe. See what it looks like. It's been so long. Well I don't know what to say. When I s when I see the when I see the product I I I I don't wanna buy it. I see so many of 'em out there. There's nothing about that product that makes me wanna choose that product over other products that are out there. Yeah yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay 'cause 'cause right now I don't have too much to say about how to market this product because we don't have a product to market yet. And uh from from talking to Mike is that we have we have uh we can market a more expensive product now. That's what I understand so  hello. And and so yeah I'm a I'm a little bit stuck right now in that what uh w what is it that I'm gonna market? Uh without special or increased marketable features I don't believe the product has a consumer demand. Uh I like the idea of of the scroll makin there are so many people making these products at this price right now. What are we gonna do to make this one special and unique? Uh well I don't yeah it's I I just see it as different. I don't say it's specially mm I don't say it's special. Uh I say that it's different I what I'm looking for as marketing is m give me something different. I give me a lower price  give me a higher price  give me some new technology  don't give me the same thing that everybody else is putting out there on the shelf it's f at the same price. I need something to market about this thing. We're we're a new firm. What i if when when we have yeah when we when we have something like the cradle or or something give that's as as a marketing standard I need something to market  to make this product unique. Yep. Mm 'kay. Just remember when I made up this report I didn't have the information that we're discussing here. And and so so uh yeah when we have a cradle  when we have some kind of design  so what I'm saying is  from my perspective  I don't have a product to market right now. Um uh my personal preference is that we make some adjustment in the cost  either lower or develop an integrated new technol technology. That's that is the next step  there's technology and then there is technology  which we're moving into the next phase. And so uh we're gonna have some new technology to enhance the marketability. Yeah uh again I'm not sold on the product because we don't have a product in my opinion yet. So I need a product. I need a product to market. And I just whatever product you guys put together  we'll find a way to market it. Tha that I'm not concerned with. If you if you give me if you give me a cut-out of what everybody else has then I need to I need to find a lower cost. Yeah wh wh what's the wh Okay now what I see with the scroll wheel is everybody has buttons. So from a marketing standpoint I have I have another door to walk through when we have something that's unique. If it creates something more complex or more expensive  then I don't know if that makes it uh a marketing necessity. But again  from a marketing perspective I want as much new and different about this thing as possible because we're we're co it's a very competitive market. Mm-hmm. Yeah yeah. I think it's that's right. I think so. Mm. Yep. I think we got some exclusivity in that  you know  we got something that nobody else has right now  and and that means we can we can make some adjustments in the retail or wholesale price if we need to and it also can create it's own demand from it's uniqueness. Yeah. Yeah right now there's right now there's nothing coming out of the T_V_ to receive  so you know unless technology changes and information starts coming out of the a cable box or something there's no s I don't see the  I don't see the necessity of an L_C_D_ either. Don't see it. Again. Well I think it's it's the more uniqueness you can bring to the product  the easier it is  I believe  for me to market. Uh again the push-buttons I I see are are everywhere. And so we can go with the same thing  but we're gonna be com competing in a in a broader market than if we go with something unique. You know the other thing I thought about was you know  do we go to something like this? Make a remote that doesn't look like a remote. It's just another it's just a an idea  and I don't know I mean what I see one of the things one of the things you brought up in an earlier presentation is  when you got children  their their stuff gets inside the circuitry  they get dirty  they get messy with drinks and stuff. This And what I keep throwing out there I just keep throwing out ideas to try to make this thing look or act or in some way identify itself as unique or different. But you guys are the ones that have to c ultimately create the product within cost. Oh okay phew. I think you gotta g get into cost effectiveness. I think if you can have the base station with a with a locator  I think those are two very strong features  if that's something that can be integrated without a bunch of extra cost. Mm-hmm. Integrated  yeah. So it's just uh I I think that's I know personally that would be a very attractive feature  is to have a uh have a button I can push to find my remote control. Or maybe you can like have a a smell-o-rama  you know you push a button and it s puts out a stink. You can Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Yeah. W Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. I I think there's you know that uh there are so many people today that are that are surfing are television surfers  and I see the scroll as a as a great mechanism for surfing. Instead of going button-to-bu you just j you'd j j j j j j. I really I really think that's a really cool thing for surfing. Well there's ano That's right. Yeah I think so. I I think so. Now the the only thing I I on the interface side of it  is that I I I see the dilemma. But if we have the option of of scrolling at any particular speed  or the option of jumping direct  okay. So I can go uh presuming I have  on my television  something that tells me what channel I'm on  I can scroll direct from channel five to channel thirty two. I know what because it's on the television. The television tells me what channel it's on when I change it. So I don't know that really that's that's gonna be a a d problem  'cause the television can go automatically from channel five to channel thirty two with the push of a button. Okay? So ca can we can we create that kind of interface within a scroll system? You understand what I'm saying? Oh no we could read it from the television. Yeah the the television can tell you. Can. Put And then. And again we have another another great marketing tool. We have about three we have three or four things here. I dunno and an maybe we maybe even have this as in-house technology. This may be something that's available through our own uh through our own services. Or we go directional up we go we go this we go this we go this way for one  we go this way for the other. Ah-ha okay. Okay  okay  well then you just have  you have a diff you have a mode switch. Yeah yeah. Well you had acknowledged that we have more money for this. Didn't you say so? That's what I mean. We can increase the cost. So I don't know I don't know whether having Well I think th I think the design and technology has to come back and say  okay to create this product we see it's gonna cost us this much for this volume  because we do have a volume target of of fifty million profit. Okay I'm I'm okay with that. I guess what I just want to me the next step is for these guys to come come in with the design proposal w with the cost estimate attached  and then we have to take this to the next level. We have to find cost. Yeah  I was gonna say thirty five to fifty. Because one of th one of the things we're marketing about this product is that this is the last one you will ever need to buy for your television. It's one of the marketing features in this. Mm-hmm. Yeah yeah. Bas th that's that's easy. That's that's not a  it's a. 'Cause we have about six  six  seven features in that alone. Under the title of uniquenesses. Well I have Is my three twenty one is the next meeting? That's that's almost uh fifty minutes. You guys can You guys you guys can uh create a All kinds of things. Thanks  yeah. Still. Thank you. I don't have any emails. This means I can go home. Oh  we all leave. Alright well we got some exciting stuff for you guys. Or not. All ready. We do. Alright. I guess I'll go first. Yeah. Component  I think. Yeah. Yep that's it. My name is. My name is name. Sorry I did this in a bit of a rush. So so here's a look inside your really old-looking remote control. Um you've got a printed a printed uh circuit board here  and you've got all these buttons which kinda press down little rubber nubbies into these little holes that activate Yeah we've all broken a remote control. So you've also got um you've got your chip here  your batteries here  and some sorta electronics. Um Well so you've got here's here's a transistor  and this amplifies your signal  um you've got the L_E_D_ here on the end of the uh uh on the end of the printed circuit board. Um you've got a couple diodes here for I don't know who and whatnot. So exactly. So um we've got a i in this in this uh drawing he uh in this example here  this is a eighteen pin um uh chip I dunno. Uh it's two double A_ batteries. This is pretty standard remote. So here are options for our power sources. You can use a basic battery  which we've already discussed  um th our tech department also said we have the option of doing some kind of hand dynamo where maybe you crank it or something like that. I don't know if that's really I don't know we got some qu crazy guys down there in that department so You shake it. Yeah. So that's the next bullet is the um the kinetic provision of energy  so it's like that flashlight where you have to shake it. Uh we've got solar cells  which I don't think is a very good idea because um you could not use your remote at night which doesn't make a lot of sense. And finally we've got our cradle o our power cradle idea. M battery versus cradle I think is yeah. It could be fun. Yeah. Well it is it is more uh I mean it is more eco-friendly than the than the cradle 'cause you're still using power off the grid with the cradle. So um our case design. We have uh choices in materials and choices in the general shapes that we can do. Our material choices are a plastic latex um ty or plastic  a rubber latex type thing  uh wood  or titanium. If we go with titanium we're gonna be uh limited in the amount of shapes we can do because it's tough to shape the titanium  and uh Yeah pers I think wood i I I can't see anybody wanting to use a wooden remote  it's just anti-technology really  you know. Right. And what we may be able to do  and I think this might be the best option is to combine some a couple of these. Um my recommendation personally would be to do some kind of a plastic inner shell with a like a rubber outer shell  to make it um to mak uh like a thick plastic inner shell and a t um kind of a to have that rubber outer shell to make it more durable  and also maybe i I think it feels a little better than the plastic. Yeah um Yeah. The advantages of working with plastic and rubber is w we we'll have a lot more um options just in terms of shape because you can extrude plastic in basically any shape you want. So um and then we can cover you know the breakable bits with rubber yeah so um But basically these are curved and double-curved I I believe that the tech department  in their um in their message to me  that they were referring to the number of th curves in the bottom. I have no idea exactly what they're talking about  but that's what they told me  uncurved  flat  curved  or double-curved. I would guess this like this pen would be kinda like a double-curved  where it's curved on m m multiple axes  right? I think curved means just curved in one axis and double-curved is curved in two axes or surfaces. I have no idea. Oh okay oh like a wave  okay. Alright that makes sense okay. Um okay  with the interface we have the following options  we can u we can use push buttons  we can use a scroll wheel with an integrated push button  and L_C_D_ display  or multiple scrolling wheels. Um so these are all options that the user interface guy can uh has at his disposal to put together a user interface. For electronics  we have these very technical um descriptions here. A simple chip  which is the least expensive  but I have no numbers to give you  a regular chip  which is like the medium porridge the medium expense uh Yes the difference is  with a simple chip a simple chip will operate oh why doesn't this scroll up? Previous previous  okay. A simple chip is required to operate push buttons. Um an advanced chip is required to to operate um the L_C_D_ display  and it didn't say specifically  but I I have a hunch that a regular chip is gonna be the scroll wheel and the multiple scroll wheels. So but yeah. That's the end of my presentation. I think No. If the T_V_ is working  yeah. That's just I mean it'll if somebody says up in the middle of a television show  it's gonna change the channel. So Well then why don't you just press the up button? Even still there's gonna be interf th there's there still will be interference from the T_V_. It might not be it might not be completely confusing  but I think you'll still y it's still I don't think it's practical at all. I think it's a bad idea frankly. That I would believe. Mm-hmm. That's not a scroll wheel. Right. Instead of play  stop  rewind  and fast forward there  that's up  down  louder  and quieter. Trend watching has a later date there. Are you talking about the picture? That's not our that's not our b design  that's just a that's just something he a a graphic he used to show you the layout of what the layout of the buttons might be like. What's special and unique about a scroll? Well right I think the two big th points that we have so far are the having the cradle and also having uh the um the actual design of the uh case itself having like this like rubber shell maybe with a plastic interior  having it look really nice um and also be really durable. Right yeah. Yeah. Well let's get a product then. Well my question is what would the scroll wheel do? Function-wise  what does that do that Yeah. Well it's it's just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do. Yeah. Th they are gonna be more expensive  but on the other hand  I mean  it I mean it is an alternative if if you think that's gonna sell some some uh you know if if we're gonna make up the extra cost by extra sales I think maybe it's worth it to do it  but I mean I would just use if I was gonna do this I would just use the scroll wheel for s channels up and channels down. I don't think volume or do you think volume would be No we can we can do multiple scroll wheels but Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I'm thinking yeah something like kinda almost like these pens  you know  where there's you have plastic bits and then it's not really rubber but just kinda like a fused the plastic with rubber on the outside. Well no ma yeah maybe a bit more then th is on here but ju just as a kind of an inspiration  these pens I think are are kind of Or from from my perspective I think L_C_D_ is a mistake because this is a universal remote and all you're doing I mean it's you're not gonna get any information back from the television  so the only information you can display on this remote is what channel you just sent it at last and there's just not a lot of information  you know  there. It receives no information. So I I don't see any reason for having an L_C_D_ 'cause it's an increased cost. Unless you can think of something interesting to do with it. Right. Well we have to I think for me it's still not exactly clear exactly what the inter user interface is gonna be. There's the scroll wheel  in or out? What do you guys like in the user interface? Well I dunno about like the flip-phone idea  because I think  as far as durability th it's not a big well maybe when it's closed. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well The The locator's gonna require a radio transmitter  which will Um we're probably gonna have to go with a like a medium chip  s I would imagine. But we I we will need a receiver  an antenna. Yeah. It should be a really simple signal though so That's true yeah. Oh yeah yeah. It'll be really cheap. So the scroll wheel  in or out? For me I think the scroll wheel actually might not be so bad. I don't know exactly what the increased cost is gonna be  but I think he does have a point  i it might push somebody over the edge when they're looking at our at our remote versus something else  when they see this one has a scroll wheel to go up and down on the channels. I think it might be kinda neat to be able to do it like that. Sure. Well I think wh what it would be is like like the m like this  where it's maybe you know a digital wheel  right  where it's where it's quantized into you know certain That was that was my my intuition of what the scroll wheel would be. It's just it's basically it it's just a f look and feel thing. It has the same exact functionality as two buttons. Yeah. Now just just so you know though uh you did bring up a point which is very valid  is a lot of T_V_s won't re the T_V_s won't respond exactly the same. Some of them are gonna be kinda slow switching  so you may like queue up like fifteen channel changes  and it'll be like flip  flip  flip. But Right. Yeah it just might be frustrating where you can't make it go as fast as you want  but I think once people get used to it I I do like the idea of the scroll wheel though. I think I know what you might be getting at  or or Well  what about this what about if you can programme in your favourite channels into this scroll wheel and you can just like roll through your favourite channels  and it c it Why? It'll tell you when you flip the channel on the T_V_. Yeah. Well you just it's one extra button. You say programme start  and then type in 'cause you still have the typing you know you'll still have the keypad where you can type 'em in manually. So programme start  zero  one  enter  zero  five  enter  thirty eight  enter  programme end. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Oh well we also have to determine in some manner how to switch between modes  between going through your favourites list and just hitting up one  up two. No because you wanna be able to go up and down through the channels. Right. I think we'll need a we'll need a mode switch  but then if we have a mode switch we're gonna need some kinda indicator to which  an L_E_ an L_E_D_ okay. Okay. Okay. Just so you know I think I mean it was my understanding that before we were gonna stay in the mid-market range. It seems we're kind of approaching a higher-end range. I wanna make sure everybody's okay with that. Okay. I just wanna make sure everybody's on board with it. So Right. Well y yeah. Let's let's try and think now  how much would you pay for with all these features how much would you pay if you went to the store  and you were in the market f to replace your T_V_ remote  how much would you pay for that? I'm just asking you. If Then you could probably afford this. Oh no no. I would say thirty five to forty. Okay. Right. With a cradle  radio transmitters  and back-lit buttons. And it's gonna look sexy. Or not. It might look like clay. Probably. We'll let you know when we're done  if we can go earlier. Yeah. I don't think so. If we have any questions we'll just email you I guess. Afternoon guys. It's gonna be. Oh. 'Kay. We may do. I dunno  I'm feeling like a big boy. 'Kay  ready to go? 'Kay so we've got our conceptual design meeting. Hopefully we've all got exciting ideas now. Uh k exciting ideas. 'Kay so here's our agenda our agenda. Um I'm gonna open. I'm gonna talk for a bit about what we're gonna do. I'm gonna take some notes. We're gonna all do a presentation  and then hopefully we're gonna make some decisions now. Yep. Well when I say hopefully  we have to. So I'm gonna let you guys talk before we make decisions. And does anyone really want to go first? You p two? What's Components design. Your name is name? Huh hi name. Right. We've all broke a remote control ri um s yeah. You press this and it does th I dunno who and whatnot. 'Kay. Okay. 'Kay. Mm 'kay. Okay so we basically have battery versus cradle here? Okay. So we have battery versus cradle It's actually a novel thing because you could sell it a as a novelty  just to be actually serious for a minute here  you could Mm. Hmm. Wood wood would ge would give us a little bit of a marketing niche  wouldn't it. Nah. Okay. Hmm. Okay. 'Kay. Do you get a good grip on the rubber? Yeah okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I think it might mean something like that sorta shape because a double curve rather than a yeah that's what. Okay. D do we have actually any concept of what the difference is between a simple chip and an advanced chip? Okay. Okay. Yeah that makes sense. So presentation from I guess design would go best. Next. Technical functions or interface concept? Yeah that's it. Yes  but it has your name on it. But what if you actually had to press a button to make it recognize? So if you pressed it and went  up? Man yeah. But if it's just one thing with a button that you can just go Up. Yeah  okay. Okay. You guys know your stuff. Mm. So we're suggesting doing a sorta scroll wheel thing for the volume? Nah. Oh okay okay. I see. Uh  okay. Okay. 'Kay. So on to Y functional requirements or trend watching? forty six nineteen fifty seven. Yep. Mm. Upper management said yes. Uh e excuse that  that's a bit of spam. It's cool. I'd I'd say though that we if we did make the decision to go with the cradle though  the then we have that as well  but wi with a similar Mm. Course. Yeah 'cause that's. Mm. Mm 'kay. So now So our big questions here really are cradle or not cradle? Do we go basic or do we go for features? Uh d does anyone really wanna do anything with the scroll wheel or should we ditch that off-hand first? Oh but that was in your presentation so wh what would you imagine it doing? Mm 'kay. Yeah. What I understand about scroll wheels is they're they're quite expensive to to make. So I d Well I d I like the idea of basically focusing the my personal preference is focusing the p the product on the idea of the uh the case the the uh dock to put it in to to charge it. We can target like environmentally friendly ideas  that sorta things. It s i m makes it easy to market  it's easy to differentiate the product  yeah so. And if we we keep the rest in a format that is durable because th th the whole product's gonna need to be more durable th thus because you're not going to be ditching it as often. It's gonna need to be more expensive because of the cradle. So if we can market it in terms of that and yeah well So our big decision then is like how do we do um like we have to decide on the details and we have to decide on well n not exactly the details  but d do we have uh What type of casing? I personally like what you were saying about the plastic with the rubber. Okay. Just a very thin sorta sheet for a a grip  sorta thing or for Okay. So then if we d d do we want to do anything more basic with the uh more advanced with the user interface in terms of do we want to go for um buttons  or do we want if we're ditching the scroll wheels do we want to go L_C_D_? Do we want to give do we want to have anything else on it? Okay. Okay so the question is now I guess we need t to decide on well y you guys basically have to now go and figure out the details of this thing. So  what we need to know in terms of marketing and uh project management are are there any other questions that we need to answer now before you guys can go and build this? What what overall things have we not decided on? I think maybe in terms of marketing  is that gonna make enough of a difference to justify the cost? Yeah and I guess th th the question th th that you're being asked right now is whether is the dock enough of a unique feature to be able to go out and sell that a a as a a very different product  or do we really need the scroll wheel as well? Because the scroll wheel comes at quite a cost. That's gonna n is that gonna need a better chip as well? And it's presumably gonna need a little speaker in it or something like that as well to beep. But I guess a little tiny speaker is gonna be quite cheap  it's not gonna need q quality  is it? It's Makes your living room more fresh as you watch. Okay we're doing well for time here. Um we've got about another ten minutes. I think that uh Mm pr my personal preference is out. I don't think the cost is justified for a little bit more uniqueness when we already have that  and I don't s think it's obvious and natural how it would be used. Mm. But then that that surely d depends a little on the T_V_ because some T_V_s are quite slow at changing channels from like so if you've got a scroll wheel and you s you have to scroll scroll it really really slowly just so that you're actually keeping in pace with the T_V_'s ability to to change channels. Or do you have to go through and you wait for it? You scroll it a bunch of times and you wait for it to Mm. Uh I see I see. That's where you Ah I see I see what you're talking about now. Okay. Yeah if you're just sitting there going That's kinda cool actually. I like that. Well not n necessarily. You could basically make it so that it'll I mean it's just gonna be sending a signal to the T_V_ yeah the T_V_'s ge so if you send about five flip channels  if you did that it's gonna flip once. If you do that. Other than click click click. Yeah. And if we're marketing it as a high niche product  then we're gonna be selling it to people who are buying good T_V_s as well  yeah  presumably. Primarily. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Oh I see so if maybe if we had an L_C_D_ up the top that just did a number on it  right? And then it that basically Mm. Well that's quite cool. You'd need a display on the th the thing. Oh yeah yeah no I see what you're talking about. Yeah that's kinda cool. How would you program it though? Okay okay. Okay and yeah and that just basically flips between it and it'll go it sends out zero  five  and then thirty six  and then zero  one again. Yeah that's kinda cool. I like that. That's not gonna be too expensive because that's gonna be you're gonna be able to nab that off of computer mouse manufacturers really. You could basically come up with a partnership to be able to produce that quite cheaply. Might be  but tha that's not gonna be such a costly feature. The problem we're gonna have is making it robust. Making it last. So if there's a button for each type. Yeah people are gonna have their favourite sorta  whether they do that or whether they Yeah yeah the mode switch. Just the lights behind the buttons. You could have back-lit buttons maybe. Would that work? Is that okay we have five minutes. So right details th that we've talked about here are that we want a scroll wheel. We want a mode indicator. We want back-lit buttons. And if we're making back-lit buttons period  do we want that just for the mode indicator or maybe to indicate what button you're pressing at the time  so that you know if it's actually pressed or not. I've seen some remotes do that. I think we are yeah. Yeah well we don't have it's not that we have more money  we can push up the the price. Yeah. 'Kay. Yeah. So we really need to be sure as to what we can push the cost up to  though we haven't got to a stage where we're ready to pin down the price of components. But I'd say what sorta price are we looking to be able to sell something like that  and what sorta price can we make it for? Yeah no I I think that's where we really should be more flexible than anything else because as we said in the last meeting  our management is really looking for us to push our brand. We're entering a new market here  so I think the the profit expectation for this one product is maybe not as important as being able to But th what's our ballpark as to what we'd be able to sell something like this for? But you've gotta think who our target market is because I I'm not our target market. I'm a student  but on the other hand I would think  mm with my Project Manager salary  I would think yeah I could probably afford this uh would I buy it? Maybe. If I had a cool new T_V_ and this was r looking really slick and it had the dock and it had the scroll wheel  which I think's a really cool idea  that would sell me on it a little. Then maybe you know. I do I don't think I'd go over a hundred Euro certainly  that would be way too much  but the I would be happy paying over forty for it  I guess  but not much 'Kay. Thirty five to fifty Euros is our sales bracket okay. So the question is what we ca we make it for. Mm. That's why the scroll needs to be really robust. Yep. Okay. The next meeting starts in thirty minutes  although does it? It starts at three twenty one  the next meeting. So we've got more than a thirty minutes. Um we've got more like fifty. The the ne next meeting is three twenty one yeah. Yeah that is. Uh they've they've changed the times from the presentations. Okay so you guys will be getting your modelling done now and uh Okay are there any other questions with regards to what this thing's gonna do  look like  how it's gonna work that need to be addressed before we really look at this in a lot of detail? Okay. Okay. This one was quite easy. Always the optimist. 'Kay thanks guys. ,When the meeting begins the project manager lists the agenda and then describes the project  which is to develop a new remote control that is original  trendy  and user-friendly. The group practices using the smart board by choosing an animal to draw and then explaining why they picked it. The project manager goes over the product budget and they proceed to have discussion. They each identify their individual tasks during each phase based on their role in the group. They briefly discuss characteristics of a desirable remote  including medium size buttons  small unit  and work within a good zapping range. The team again discusses their individual responsibilities and move on to ponder whether the remote will be multifunctional or only for the TV. They decide to first assume it is only for TV and video  but allowing the possibility to add more features. They close the meeting upon establishing what each person will do. 
Well hi everyone again. Um like before we uh I have to redo the meetings from n th the minutes from the last meeting and so here we go. Uh it was discussed in the last meeting uh which was opened by the presentation from the interface um designer that uh looks would be very important on this new remote and um it is to send messages of course to the T_V_. It should have nine channel buttons  a next button  volume buttons  subtitle buttons  switch to control features  colour contrast  sharpness etcetera. It should have a memory switch  a mute button in case the telephone rings or something. Uh speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal uh features she would like see d d to be integrated in this um in this new remote. Um. Should be child friendly design with few buttons  colourful maybe with s star shaped or other shaped buttons. Um she uh presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose. Um that's right. But uh her very f personal favourite really she  she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote. The industrial designer um presented her uh thoughts on the issue. She would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong  not using any harmful materials  should be recyclable and should be colourful. Should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant. She would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated. Uh technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor  diode transistor  resonator  and if possible a rechargeable battery. Uh and of course a circuit board. And how it would works  you press the button  the chip is morse morse code related relays the uh to the generat to the generator amplification and uh the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and so she thinks this is a great feature uh to to to consider. She would like uh this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip uh scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore. Should be battery operated and of course she would have the special cases. The marketing expert uh who has to finally come up with to to to market this product has been watching the competition  has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small  easy to use and it should be eye catching. From her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does. To do that uh maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on. Too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter. So we prefer to have one or two features that can be really uh driven home. Um it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel. She feels that's really what people want today. And the decision that we took last time was that uh the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser  the energy should be battery uh should be on a chip  should be trendy design  compact and strong  and should have buttons. And that concludes the presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting. Now uh we are ready for the presentation of the prototype. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm  mm-hmm. Mm-hmm  mm-hmm. What kind of button? Menu? Uh menu th menu  uh one one. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yes the buttons are all raised  right? Are raised  mm-hmm. Right. Or have two hands to operate it  yeah. Yes  and it sort of sticks up so that you really you don't have to g first go like oh yeah here it's on and yeah  mm-hmm. So if you're left-handed or right-handed it doesn't matter. Well  I have one question uh will there be anything written on the buttons  like that people know  or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what? Will have symbols so that that that the user really knows you know and doesn't have to first learn it Yeah. But anyway it would ha i i i it has to have some kind of of symbols  text or something so that people kn That's right. Okay  yeah just wanted make sure of that mm-hmm. Right  mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. Now what  what are our special features for the marketing? That's really the voice recognition that's really unusual And then  and then the other thing would basically be sh shape or practicality of use. You know. Colours. Mm-hmm. Cutest. Yeah. Okay  now uh having said that No  now this was our evaluation criteria which we uh just have done. Now we're gonna talk about financing. Well  there is a production evaluation. Is that you? But that's after the financing. See? Fi see? Um. Okay  we had looks and voice recognition. Okay now on the financing we bring up the mm there it is. Okay uh energy source we say that's battery  right? Okay  now. So we I guess we use one. What? T cell or chart you are trying to change is protected. Well  that's nice. She told me I could just ch change it here and then it would It doesn't work. Hmm. Oh  okay yeah  okay  let's see. Okay  one  okay. Oh go away. Um kinetic source so that's in the energy source that's all we need. Uh electronics  simple chip on print? Is that's what we're using? One of those? Come on. Okay  one. Uh regular chip on print. No. That's all we need  the one case  uncurved flat  single curved  double curved. Double curved? One of those? Case materi s supplements. Plastic we said  right? Uh wood  rubber? Uh but  yes but That's just for the case material  so special colours though  we having that  right? And then we have to interface push buttons. Scroll wheel  no. Integrated scroll wheel  L_C_ display? Button. No. Uh  button supplement special colour? Special form? And special material  rubber  wood  yes. Okay. Total seven point six whatever that means. That's the price. Mm? Eight  eight point two. That's hmm? Eight point two  right? So  we looks like we are well within budget. Okay. I guess I should save this I suppose  huh? Oops. Uh-huh huh huh. I just tried that. My documents  computer. My compu Ah oh here it is  yes. Okay  fine. Save. Okay good  so that's the good news. We gonna be popular. Um. So that uh I think financing was pretty simple. Now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation. You wanna go to the next slide? Okay. Um I just realised one thing. In the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser. And uh I don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that  too. Eight  eight twenty  yes. I mean maximum we have another four point three euros I mean four thirty. But I mean we have no way of presenting that to management as you know as a f finished  as a finished product and saying okay with the voice recogniser that costs so much. So um we just have to beware of that. I mean and know whether the four thirty will really cover that. Yeah. I'm sorry to interrupt then but I just uh recog I just remembered that there was no that that was not um included uh that there was no room for any special features  okay? So to beware of that. You wanna go to this next slide  marketing expert? I dunno. Yes it is. Mm-hmm. Oh. Why? Wh why you need that up? I think you can make it there. Yes I think uh shape is one. You you gave it a four. Um  I dunno. I think I would give it at least a two. Colour uh I One. I I like the colours. One. Uh  I think I would give it a two. Well it's also you can't really try it out uh the other things you have have more is are more tangible so from that point of view but um I'll give it a three. Uh. Here is what we looking at uh satisfaction on for example room for creativity. Um. Is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy? Y um al always bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget and that we still you know we probably can't  with this particular item  we probably can't just uh add a whole lot of more things. Uh um we need uh you know we need to leave space money-wise for the voice recogniser. Um. So th the question really is how do we feel with the project process? Uh  um are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we're not happy with the new product we created or that was created? Uh I think personally I think uh I'm pretty happy. Um an and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project? Uh And I think team work I think was very very good  I think we really yeah. Mm-hmm. And uh I think we are we happy with the means we used? We used whiteboard  we didn't use digital p well digital pens I guess are these things. Yes  we could. Uh  it's maybe not in the best position in the room um you know like sometimes it's positioned so that it's much better visible for everybody and I think from that point of view we sort of ignored it a little bit. Yes  I think so  I think absolutely  and fortunately we all had slides presentation which made it a little easier. Um did we new did we find new ideas? I think we did. I think we we did  uh in more than one respect and uh so I think we did very well here. Are the costs within budget? Yes  yes. Uh is the project evaluated? Yes. Um then celebration. So I I thank you all very much. Um  I think this was very good and um I think we did come up with a new product that's uh feasible. Feasible from the production point of view and feasible from a marketing point of view. So  thank you. I always get it on here  but getting it off is Ah yes we have time later but we don't Hello Mm-hmm. And she was challenged on that point Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Good. You used to have all the buttons Oh that's good  no  that's nice and friendly. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah  okay  mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Menu button. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Of the screen. Mm  mm-hmm. The next channel in the numeric pattern  or Yeah  mm-hmm. Mm. Okay  okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay  well um what what I really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb  that you can really hold it in one h you don't need two hands and it's easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand  yeah? The buttons are all raised and if you hold it in the centre of your hand you can even reach it over here so you don't have to turn it around  turn it upside down  move it up  up and down  I really like that. You really did a good job on that  my little designers. Um and um I like the idea that the on-off button is in a really prominent place. That's that's a really good good thing. Yeah  that's great. Mm-hmm. The colour's very attractive. Um the um these buttons uh around here are the mute and these mm-hmm On both sides they're mute? So you can push either one? Okay. And this brings the menu up on the screen? This brings the menu up on the screen and the orange ones are Okay. F f okay. Right  very good. Uh it looks mm looks like something I can sell. Okay and now I'm supposed to yeah. Yeah. Good point because we need the symbols 'cause we're going into an international market we can't have anything that's language dependent. Symbols on it. Mm-hmm  mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm  'kay  mm. Mm-hmm. For the snail  yeah  mm-hmm  we have the snail shell. He goes right back into his shell. Well you know I think we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow and we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that you know that would  that would really work. So I think voice recognition is our big selling point 'cause nobody else seems to have that in in this price range. Yep uh well I think that everybody's gonna say their remote control is practical. I think we have to  we have to dwell on on on the appearance. We're really gonna have the be the cutest remote control on the block. So I think we have to play with the image  play with the snail image um play with the visual and then the voice recognition. I think those are the two things to push. The look and the voice recognition. They're gonna be our two selling points. I'm supposed to make a little presentation  aren't I? Okay. Ah  but in my instructions I think it said I was supposed to go to the board and do something. No? Yeah  that's me. Oh  okay. Sorry  sorry. Mm-mm. That's right. Can you just fill it in in the yellow boxes? Or Well. I guess it's double curved. Mm-hmm. Rubber  because we're gonna have the soft buttons. Oh okay  the mm-hmm  mm' kay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No  'cause we didn't put the clock in it after all  right? Mm-hmm. Yes. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay  I'll take my file down so you can bring it up. 'Kay should be able to get it now. 'Kay  why don't you move just to the next slide right away. Yeah right away. Okay  well uh obviously my method for uh s m the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question  will it sell? And I think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio-economic groups and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things we haven't thought of. We can't accept every suggestion of course  but maybe we just need to get a few. And show the the prototype to consumer research groups  we don't s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any. So we have to get some input from those people. And then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and you know we like it  we think it's good  we're gonna get behind it and sell it. Um  next slide please. Okay  now the things that I was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype. I wanted the shape to be biomorphic  I didn't want anything with angles and all square  I wanted it to be comfy and roundy so we we've got that. The size is small  the colour's bright and warm which is what we wanted. We wanted the feel to be as soft as possible  we'll have the soft buttons and the way this is shaped  even though it's gonna be hard plastic  it feels good in your hand so that's nice. And functionality I put last on my list because people aren't going to use it before they buy it. So paradoxically the other features  in other words  the look  the feel um and the shape  that's what people are gonna get in the store. They don't have a television in the store  they can't play with it. Um so they'll be our main selling points. So um th those have been fulfilled by your prototype and go ahead to the next slide please. Okay  so um the shape um I think is a a one. That's really  really excellent shape. The size is small um and th these points are in the importance for the  for the marketing  these aren't i in how I feel. I think that it's I think that it's plenty small enough to sell but I think we're sort of right the scale is one to seven. I think we're sort of right in the middle as far as c other competitors. And our colour I think is great. The colours are bright and warm and we really do great job there. And given um the constraints that we had I think we got it as soft as possible. And then functionality um I think you did a really good job on functionality  obviously we could have ad added different functions but then we'd disturb something else so I would say that we got to a five out of seven on on functionality. So I think that basically we've got a great product and we can get off and running with it. Yes. Ah. Well  um we had what  eight eight euros twenty as our cost? And so we've got we've still got four euros to go to spend. Mm-hmm. Well um that's Mm-hmm. Well as we know in today's technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price  the the the problem is quality. So we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us. And um it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway. As we've seen with so many of these kinds of products. Uh  well I isn't this my last slide? Maybe. Go ahead. I think that was my last slide  yeah. Um. Mm okay. And I'm supposed to present this scale on the whiteboard. Um and we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now  so if you put my last slide back up there. I'm sorry I've um forgot to do that  um. Hmm? Well because I can't remember what I put on there. Okay. Now I'm supposed to see how long my leash is here. Mm 'kay. You ready. So now we're all supposed to say what we think. Um okay so on shape I gave it a one. Wait what would you ra uh one being good and seven being the worst. Um what do you think the shape is? One  okay  and Be Betsy? Okay  uh-huh one  okay. And how about on size? On size I gave it a four  yeah  I feel it's just average. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay you're the designer  of course you wanna give it a one. Um and then how about how we doing on colour? Colour  I gave it a one. I really like all those nice bright  warm colours. One. One  one  one  okay. And how about the feel? Taking into um consideration texture and comfort in the hand. Okay  I gave it a three  two  yeah? Three. Two  okay. And the next is functionality where I I admit I was a little hard on our team here  but Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Two  okay. Three? Okay. Well  um. It looks like we've got got ourselves a pretty good product. Um the functionality's the only place where maybe we have to think about m m maybe  heaven forbid  having another meeting. But um otherwise I think we're we're ready to go to go with this product. Anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate? Mm-hmm. Well then again if we're gonna um do the speech recognition thing we're gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech. So that that's where we're gonna have to do maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons  instead of having two mute buttons. And um then maybe we can do something with the um the volume control. Maybe we can put that all on one button. Um and a couple of other th maybe comp uh consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that. Mm-hmm. No. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I'm pretty happy with it too  yeah um  it's something I think I can market. Yeah. I think you've done a good job  Miss leader. Yeah I d I do too I think we worked well together as a team  yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah maybe we could've used the whiteboard a little bit more  yeah  we didn't use that enough. Mm-hmm. And we used the slide because it was better positioned. Mm I think that's true mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I think we were we were very good  yeah  mm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yes  yes. Celebration. Today we have apple juice and after we sell m million of 'em we have champagne. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Watch I I have my cord behind you here. Okay. But we we were told we could end the final meeting at any time  whenever we felt we were finished. It'll take me the rest of the time to get my microphone out from my necklace. Oh  there we go. Hello. Yeah. Yeah. Uh so this is our what uh we have made. This is a model of the remote control which we are going to build. Uh this is us in a snail shape so uh it it is attractive um and it's it's blue in colour uh bright and uh it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons so it is a uh uh a looks-wise it is beautiful. Uh and also compact in shape. Uh um and also i it it will be easily fit into into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily. Yeah  oops  sorry. Um yeah and um uh the material which we are going to use for the case is uh plastic and uh w which which is s strong um uh and also uh for the Um the material is plastic and uh for the buttons it is uh s soft rubber um and als yeah. Yeah because uh uh you'll be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it. And then um uh for the for the led  for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green and it's a a it is a bulb like an ordinary infrared. And and the button button's part uh will be explained by F Francina. Tell  yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Ah. Yeah  definitely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah of course  and also Hmm. Yeah. Yeah we can Text. Text that we can have on the case itself  we can it will be printed on the case and symbols as well as the buttons. Yeah. Yeah. So it is yeah  yeah shell. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah  of course  yeah. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah  yeah. No. Yeah. This is a Yeah. Yeah. I think uh that is uh f for rubbers that is uh yeah case material. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Uh  I think that's the price. Maybe it is it just n Yeah. AMI. AMI should for Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Eight twenty so We have um four euros  yeah Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  yeah. Yeah  still. Yeah. Included  yeah. Hmm  hmm Yeah  even my yeah  shape is one. Yeah  even I think it is one. It's quite small. Yeah  one. Uh maybe two  yeah. Uh three  mm-hmm. Yeah. Maybe we can yeah  include some more buttons and uh um yeah features. We can make the buttons few buttons smaller. Uh I think they are quite big  so I think I I mean we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case. If we want to have more features than that. Yeah. Yeah  definitely. Mm-hmm. Yeah  definitely  yeah  two mu mute buttons. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Even I'm happy. Yeah. Yeah  yeah  definitely. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  probably. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah  many. Yeah. Ah. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you very much. Do we do we have some time left? Uh you have Oh  alright. Hello. Designer. Yes. Yeah. Just the look like  the button part I'll explain. Okay. Now the um we decided upon including certain features on our remote. Now these features includes the s um signal emitting uh signal it's the led or L_E_D_ the infrared. Now uh we have included the switch on and off button. Now we have included another feature that is the mute button on the side of the model. Then we have included one to nine buttons for controlling the programmes the different channels. We have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume. And we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels. Now our our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button. Menu button. Yes  menu At the centre we have included a button which is fluorescent green colour and this is the menu button which will control the colour  sharpness  brightness of this uh picture. We have also included a button which is called as the swapping button. Now this is uh a special  special feature which we have included. Now this button is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel  if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel. It will take the user to the previous and the next channel so this is a swapping button. No  swapping is if if example you're you're watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap  this button. Yes. And at the end  it this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user's voice and then it'll act accordingly. So this is our proposed model. Now the marketing expert has to give her suggestion whether it'll be sellable or it'll be cost effective. Yes  yes. Yes. Mm. Abs okay. No  these the front buttons which are here  are the mute buttons. Yes  yes. Yes. Pardon me? This is the menu yes  yes. A the the these these two are th to increase or decrease the volumes  and these two are to uh scroll the programme channels. Scroll up or scroll down the channels. Yes  it will have uh these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols. Yes  which can be easily recognised. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. And and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape. A shell shape. Yes  yes. Yes  snail shell. Yes. Mm-hmm. Y Yes Yes. Yes. Yes. Single curve? Mm. Plastic. Is this for the case? Yes. Yes. Yes. No. Speci Yes Yes d we do have special form. One two three four five six seven eight nine Nine points  okay  yes. Okay. On the desktop. Okay. Fee selling. Yes. Okay. Okay. Yes. Yes  yes. Yeah mm. Worse  okay. One. One. One. Yes. I'll give three. Two. We can always improve  yes. Yes  features. Yes. Voices. Yes. Yes. And maybe Yes. Yes  yes you've done a good job. Whiteboard more  yes  yes. Yes. No. Yes. Cel celebration yes  yes. Thank you. Okay. They say it's forty minutes. Okay. ,The project manager opens the meeting  asking the industrial designer to present first. The industrial designer begins talking about the functional aspect of the working design and features to make the product unique  such as visibility in the dark  locator alarm  and environmentally-friendly materials. To make an environmental impact  they could use smart materials that can be heated and cooled so that the individual components easily separate to be reused or recycled. The group asks some questions about this idea and then the interface designer presents about technical functions  explaining the difference between a multifunctional and single function remote. The group discusses the two types and decides that a single function design is more suitable for the budget. The marketing expert presents on user requirements by using research done on remote control users. She summarizes these findings andexplains her personal preference for a user-friendly  unique design since certain features could be too complex. The project manager receives some decision-affecting information from management  which she shares with the group. They have a discussion about the remote control functions and close the meeting. 
Right uh. So um. So where's the PowerPoint presentation? Sorry? Microsoft PowerPoint  right. Right  okay. So. Right. Okay  so we've got uh so we've got new project requirements. Um. So basically we've got three things  and we've got forty minutes in which to uh for this meeting to uh to discuss the various options. Um. Three presentations. I see  right. That's nice to know  one from each of you. Um new project requirements. Um so do we want to do the presentation first  or do we want to um W I I got um or or three things basically  um relating to the remote being only for T_V_. We discussed that last time and in actual fact that was pr pretty well what we came up with anyway. So in fact it actually f we won't be forestalled in a sense. Um we've got uh teletext outdated. Um did you get any information on that? Right and the corporate image was the uh final thing. So I I got that in email form. Um. Right okay. So I guess if we go ahead with the uh with the three presentations. So we'll start with yourself on the basis that uh Sorry  yep. Oh. it going? Okay. Uh there's the rubber on the right  I think. it's magic. So the the top bit's the power source  yes?. So the battery is the in the sender. Okay. So  now more design. That's what we like to hear. Is it control function ei Oh  th there you go. Well there's a couple of things there. Um we have to remember that we have our own um logo and colour scheme. So basically we'd have to uh we'd have to be putting that on um the the product. I haven't as yet  no. But uh I got uh I got an email that basically said to uh make sure that uh whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate um the corporate colour and slogan. So uh I'm guessing that uh uh I notice on the bottom there it's got uh what's that? A_P_O_G_E_E_ that might be the corporate colour scheme  although the only the only colour I can see in that is the red. Well b uh w Well th the on the Well uh for for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time  and we'd have to have some room for uh future such channels. But but But  well possibly but the the other thing is that with um the current expansion of uh channels uh in the process of taking place  certainly the button up and down  but uh I mean how many channels do we have to um actual television channels do we have to uh prepare for? I would have thought that uh it's forever expanding and at the moment we've got although you've onl you've got the five standard  you've got the B_B_C_ have come up with a further six and uh there's uh I don't know exactly how many channels there are on uh when you take into account uh Sky and various other um various others. So I would've thought that we wouldn't  you know  rather Okay  if the time of flicking from one to other  but presumably it'll take a second 'cause you have to be able to stop it. Maybe you could have a fast forward on the on the channels that w and then you could dispense with more otherwise. Y you'd want you'd want to get fairly quickly to the channel that you wanted. Mm-hmm. Yeah  I s I suppose in a sense you could have um if you've got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting rather than having to go one to a hundred  you could go one to one to ten  ten to twenty and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want and that would cut down your time. Anyway. Whatever. Okay. Okay. Limit the number of buttons  user friendly. Yeah. Well that's true  yeah  you could get fifty by five and a zero or whatever  that that makes sense. Yeah. Does. So w so what was the circular thing that you were If it's just for T_V_  which is what it is at the moment. Mm-hmm. Well we've we've got um that it's remote for T_V_ only otherwise project would become too complex with uh which would endanger the time to market was one of the considerations. I'm I don't know d did you have that information behind the marketing  or was I meant to give you that information? Right. Right  okay  so basically time to market seems to be important  therefore speed of delivery. We've only got about another four hours left. Yeah  I think she said twenty seconds to um What was that last wee bit there? Speech recognition  right okay. But that was only for young people that preferred it  older people didn't. Well that's right. Sounds reasonable. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So Well if you're trying to avoid having a second product 'cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here I am sort of thing  you know without sound recognition. But if you I know. Um I was gonna say a sharp noise  you know a clapping of hand or whatever. You'd want to try and av just have the one product that if Yeah. Um I dunno um talking about vo I mean obviously if you've got voice recognition then you can do it in that way because it'll recognise the voice and you can give it a command  a set command whatever that happened to be. But you've then got the point if if you're not going with uh voice recognition then Mm. So uh Any sugges Well  any conclusions? Well if it does then we can't. It's that simple  because we've got uh th th three um primary um uh requisites from uh from and email uh that was sent to me whereby we had The design logo was one  which we've already mentioned. We've got um the remote was only for the television and not for because that would make it too complex and we have to get it market quickly. And the uh third thing was that um teletext uh as far as uh the management is concerned  um is becoming dated uh due to the popularity of the internet. So that means that uh so these are the sort of three um extra parameters that have been put on this uh project. So we're being focused effectively directly at a television and it seems to me that the management is uh wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out. So anything that uh is to be added  such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick because time to market is is critical. S It would. But probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras. Added extras would be nice  but the primary consideration is to get the project finished within uh this short time window  which effectively now is sort of four hours. So and if and we've gotta get to the end. Uh d d I think I think first and foremost we've gotta get to the end and then get to the end with um added extras if possible. Okay. Right okay  uh so I need to Right. So I don't know how long we have left of our uh time. But we have to make the decisions on uh the remote control functions and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next uh meeting each person that's got a a a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is. We'll also know w when the next meeting is I um so we'll know how long we've got to complete that task. And then we can report back at the next meeting and say right okay yes  we've achieved this or we haven't achieved this  this is how far we've progressed. Does that make reasonable sense? So we have to come effectively to the decision on the remote functions so that you can decide what you're gonna be doing. And if dur between the time of this meeting finishing and the next meeting starting  if you get any additional information that uh only you have at that point in time you'd think would be relevant to other people in terms of their des decision making um process  then we should communicate that as quickly as possible and not wait until the next meeting. Do it via the email so that rather than coming you know If you get the information just before the next meeting that's fine. Come along with it in the next meeting  we can discuss it then and take whatever action is appropriate. But if you get it well before the next meeting  let everybody else know 'cause that might have an impact on their uh on what they come up with effectively at the next meeting. Okay. Right  is there I would guess so. Yep. I w well uh i Something simple. Uh if if our primary consideration is to get it there in time  time's short  you want something to meet the major concerns of the consumer so that we can have that as a selling point for the product  something that's quick and simple. So  sounds good. Well  so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be On the basis that if we've got if we're catering to the whole age range  you want something that's easy to do  now something that doesn't like whis uh Well I I I don't know. Well If you think that more people can whistle than clap then that's fine  then go for that option  but if I would have thought that more people could clap rather than whistle  so uh so clap option. Okay. Uh. Ef effectively that's what the that's what they're saying  that uh if uh if people are now using the internet then you don't need teletext  so so take out teletext. Yeah. No. But the but that's relying on the television market changing to an automatic and if it is at the moment  that's fine. But at the moment it's not  so it seems to me that you have to have a device that caters  'cause otherwise it would make it uh your device would become inoperable  or only operable in certain circumstances and the idea is to have an international market which is And it's also m it's the the product we've got is something that's at the I would have said the lower end of the s of the cost scale  so we're not really going for something that's uh terribly high-tech. Possibly. That's right. Okay  well. Mm. So y Ah That's a very good idea. So you keep um Right we've got five minutes before we wind up this meeting  so I've been told. I don't know if you've got the same. Okay. So so keep um keep detailed functions um hidden at the back. Ah. Mm-hmm. That's right. data functions hidden at back. Can bring out when needed. That's right so we're dis So you've got which ones are gonna be on the front and which ones are gonna be on the back. We have to decide. I guess so. So on front  numbers  volume. Sorry? Mm. Mm-hmm. So so are you having the stand-by on the front  then? Well. Channel up and down. What else have we got? What was that  sixteen? Volume button. How many volumes? Right okay. Power button  stand-by  channel  up and down. So is that it? Okay. That's sixteen buttons  you reckon. And then at the back? Okay. So on the back it'll have brightness  contrast  anything else? You're also gonna have the channel tuner  as it were. Tuner  would that have up and down?. okay. Okay. Um up volume  yeah  I would have thought so. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Well you might get some research. Okay. Right so I'll do the minutes of uh this meeting. And we'll meet back at I'm not sure. Um forty minutes  I believe is the time. Come on. Yeah. No. What is it? I think you've got to do um control F_ eight. Shift F_ eight. Ah there  it's doing something. I think it's that little Right. Thank you. Mine's not quite as complicated as all that. Did I press function? Yeah. Oh. Um. Okay so I'm gonna talk a bit about the technical functions design. I'm Louisa  the User Interface Designer  as you know. Um so the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set  so that a desired function is performed. Um an example of the function could be to change the volume up or down  uh so obviously you need two different buttons for that. Um to change the channel  either by pressing the number that you want or by channel up or down. Um to switch the television on or off  maybe a standby button. Um here are two example remotes. Um by the look of it they both have um kind of play and fast forward  rewind functions  so I think they incorporate a kind of video function which we won't have to worry about. Uh but as you can see  the left remote is quite um quite busy looking  quite complicated. Um whereas the right remote is much simpler  it looks much more user friendly. Um so my personal preference would be the right remote. So  it's got nice big buttons  it's got a very limited number of buttons. Um they're nice  kinda clearly labelled. Um I like the use of the kind of um symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as well as the words on the um kind of play functions and all that. So it's very very user friendly  and it's got a little splash of colour. Could maybe do with some more colour. Um. Hmm. Do we get to see that? Will you be presenting that in a bit? Hmm. What do you mean by the circular section? Like all of that bottom bit? Yeah. Yeah. And I don't really think that you need nine numbers. I mean how often do you use seven  eight and nine? I think just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough. Like how often do you hit nine? Hmm. Um some remotes have kind of favourite options where if you always flick from channel one to channel six  um if that's a favourite you just like by-pass two to five. Hmm. Mm. Um. But I think a lot of um like Cable and Sky and stuff  that would be tuned to one channel  and then you'd have another remote for all of those channels. Like to get to fifty five and the higher numbers Yeah. But I suppose nine's not really excessive. I suppose it does make a good pattern. Okay. Um I think that's just for a video  so we wouldn't need any of that at all. Mm-hmm. Okay  so is everyone happy with that? Right well that's the end of my presentation. Do a lot of um There's key rings um that you kind of whistle at or clap at  I can't remember  and then they whistle back  or something like that. That'd probably be really simple  they're cheap. Yeah. Well I think it'd be really easy and it'd be a big advantage if we did have some sort of um kind of whistle back kind of function. 'Cause that'll solve kind of the frustration of losing it. Yeah. I don't really know about the voice recognition thing. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And that wouldn't put off the kind of older generation either  'cause everyone can whistle or clap  and they wouldn't have to be kind of scared of this new technology. 'Kay we've already decided that we don't need a teletext button  haven't we? Is that one of the Hmm. Right. Yeah  I think so  so zero to nine. Hmm. Mm. Yeah. Yeah  like the volume or something. Yeah  'cause you do need um kind of brightness and contrast and everything as well. My dad was watching a film the other week and it was too dark  so I had to go through it and turn the brightness up. Well  if we're trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as well  have you seen those remotes where kind of um the bottom bit slides down  so there's kind of um everything else revealed? So you don't use it that much  you don't have to see it all the time. But it's all there if you need it. Like a hidden panel. Hmm. And that'll be better for the older generation as well 'cause  well my dad doesn't like anything that you've got to kinda flick through a menu  but he can pretty much read a button if it's displayed properly. Yeah. And the volume? Um. Yeah. Yeah I think they're handy. I know it's probably like um not an issue to raise here  but um the whole thing about not using your standby uh because of the like waste of electricity. Have you seen the adverts? Like if you boil the kettle that's full that's a waste. If you leave your telly on standby it powers Blackpool for a certain amount of time. Like we should maybe try to discourage people from standby. Yeah  it's maybe too much of a big issue for here. Uh-oh danger sign. Yeah  but a little bit smaller. Compromise. Right. On mute. so. And then Mm-hmm. Uh there's audio functions. Yeah. I think they normally do. Yeah. So I think um there's quite a lot of like Dolby surround studio  surround sort of things. Um maybe for the younger market. Um I think they've got their own controls in this kind of like hidden panel. Oh no  I mean um like there's kind of individual buttons for them  like on the T_V_ remote. But I don't really know what they're for  I've never used them. I just know they're something to do with Dolby. Right. Yeah  I've got one too. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. There's usually a little thing in the top right for the Oh hang on  it's just coming on. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Um I'm not sure. I had I've had some market information  but not from the company  no. Okay. 'Kay. I'm gonna pull this off. Uh-huh. Okay. I'll give it another go. Yeah  there we go. Right  we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control. And first off we should state that th the remote control's for controlling the T_V_ and um how do people use it? We asked them sort of which buttons were useful for them. Um how d how does a remote control look and feel for them  and what improvements would would they like to remote control. And we did that by sort of giving them a questionnaire that we'd prepared and asking them to fill in the answers. And three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly and that a sort of even higher proportion would spend more for a sort of s uh a fancier remote control And that of all the buttons on the remote control  the sort of setting buttons for sort of the picture picture and brightness and the audio settings  um they weren't used very often at all. People concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons. Uh we also asked them about speech recognition uh for remote control. And young people were quite receptive to this  but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty age forty five age group and older  people people weren't quite so keen on speech recognition. There's a lot more th there's a lot lot more older people who didn't know whether they wanted it or not as well. Um we also asked what frustrated people about remote controls and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn't find it. And the second second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control  it was difficult to learn um all the buttons and all the functions  and to find your way around it. Okay  so My personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some sort of sleek sort of good looking high high-tech A design which looks high-tech  basically. Um and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market  and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power  and also volume and that sort of thing  as as Louisa said. Um we could maybe come up with a menu  a sort of a an L_C_D_ menu for other functions on the remote control. That's worth thinking about. Um and maybe we could think about speech recognition as well  because um sort of young people are perhaps the ones that are gonna buy buy our new product if we aim it at sort of you know sort of a high-tech design. That that might be the market that we're we're looking for. And we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it's lost in a room  rather than sort of um having it to speech recognition to change the channels. 'Cause there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise  so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel. Okay um  and that's the end of the slide show. That's it. Cool. Um about speech recognition? Yeah. Youn young people pref Yeah  they s they said that they'd be interested in a remote control which offered that possibility and as you go up through the age groups  people got less and less interested in sort of a a remote control that you could talk to  so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah  we'd have t that would mean we'd have to put two products together as well  which which again would probably be a bit expensive  but Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Um would it take quite a while to sort of develop the speech recognition software in the remote control? Considering Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So About five minutes. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay  yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yep. Yeah. Mm-hmm. So do we need to decide on the functions now? S Mm-hmm. Yeah and Yeah and that was that was the number one sort of frustration that people said  so. I don't think there's anything else on the market that does that  so. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No not everyone can whistle  can they  though? No  clapping  I think clapping  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Taking out teletext  okay. Mm. I think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number  so you can press any two and it'll sort of put them together. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh we could possibly put an L_ a sort of a L_C_D_ menu in  but that again is probably an expense that Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I s I suppose um if people are buying remotes  then they're probably buying it to replace another remote 'cause all most tellies come with remotes  so. I mean we're maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions  so we maybe need to keep the the tuning function in. Yeah  that would be a good idea  yeah. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Uh I'm not sure whether the sort of having people have a booklet 'cause one the second most annoying thing that people found was having to learn the new one. So maybe next to each of the buttons  you know each of them could have a number and then also a function written next to it  so you're basically pressing Right. Okay. Yeah. Yeah  yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So th the The detailed ones would be sort of brightness  uh sorta Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. And probably a power one as well. Dunno. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Um 'cause yeah the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick  so. Um. Numbers is ten  volume is twelve  th Yeah si One up  one down. And a mute  yeah. That's sixteen isn't it  yeah. I don't think so  no. You've got brightness and contrast. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then maybe sort of an enter button for sort of s you know  saying that you want that particular thing tuned in. So you go up and down and then it pick it finds something and then you wanna press enter to select it  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Right. Okay. We have a I guess we have a presentation each  'cause I've got one. Um. Mm-hmm. Uh we didn't  no. I d I didn't personally. Okay that's fine. I'll just um I'll grab the wire out the back of this one. I'm not quite sure how it Control Doesn't seem to be quite working at the moment. Alt function F_ eight. Again not doing anything. Oh. pressed about five times now. Okay  that's me. Okay  um I have to go again. Hopefully that should be it this time. Okay  I think we're there. That's good. Okay  um Okay I'm gonna be looking at the working design. Um of the of the remote control. Um I've just got three sections  first is the research I made on the on the remote control itself um. And then that involves the components required in it and the systems uh design of the actual the actual remote. Um so having researched the existing models within the market  um I found my research off the internet. Um I've established what the components required for the remote control to function  actually are. And then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do and how it connects with the television. Um the basic components are an energy source which I guess um in most existing models would be a battery supply. Whether that'll be sort of two batteries  four batteries  um it may vary. We then have the user interface  which is basically the like the the buttons on the actual remote. Um the various functions used for changing channel  uh channel up and down  volume  things like that. Um there's also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things. And then the sender  which um is usually  I've found  an infra-red device which sends a signal to the actual television. Um and the last part is receiver which is important in the system but is not actually part of the remote itself  because that's obviously found in the television.. Um I'm gonna have to actually draw on the board because uh it was a little tricky on PowerPoint to get this working  so. I'll just go through there. S um um do we have a cloth to wipe this down with  or? Oh I'll j Oh I see. Oh okay. I'll get rid of the bear Okay that's great. Okay  so we start off with a um battery suppl Uh no  a power supply which we'd probably get it's probably gonna be the battery. Um we then have a particular button  which may be that's obviously there's lots and lots of different buttons. Um but this is how the basic system works. Um that sends after you press that that sends the message to the chip  which um then sends It sort of interprets which button you've pressed and then sends the appropriate message to the sender. Um. So that's. That's the remote in itself  that's the components of the remote and how they work together. So this is the uh user interface. Um this is the chip itself  which then  and that's the that's the infra-red sender. And then on the separate thing we have on the on the television we have a a receiver. And the sender sends a message to the receiver. 'Kay. Ah yes  that's the power source. Um. going on to personal preferences  I've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote  just because of the size. You don't want a a cable attached to the remote otherwise it's not it's not really a remote. Um and then the sender  and infra-red um has been used quite successfully. If the battery's on reasonable power  they always seem to work fairly well. You don't have to be point directly at the television itself. Um Yes. 'Kay and that's it for the moment. Would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here  the the sort of circular section  because that seems to be for a video as well. So we could dispense with that little bit as well and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume. Possibly? J yeah yeah yeah j yeah just this little bit is that I think that's still um a video remote part  so maybe we could get rid of that as well. It's just people are used to seeing that  so if we didn't have them then they might think it's Hmm. Okay  yeah. I suppose with nine you've got the the like the last one which makes the tenth means you uh it's like uh multiples you can put them together so you can make any number. So with that we'd kind of by-pass any problems with Yeah. Yeah. 'Cause that facilitates having all the numbers you could ever need. Um. So we could get it down to what? So we get to How many buttons have we got? We've just got ten  eleven twelve th We got fourteen that we need. I guess. Um which isn't really too many. That'll be quite easy to make a user guide for a fourteen button remote. 'Kay. 'Kay. Ah yes yes  that seems good. I think if you just give it a second to maybe catch up. I'm sure we'll have by the end of today. Mm. No what I maybe think is um it seems the technology would be quite advanced for that and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for for the speech recognition. Um. And possibly the thing about the about the remote being lost we could have You know with your mobile phone  you lose that and you can ring it. Maybe we can have some kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can some kind of buzzer system between the two. So you can press a button which is always kept in one place and then it maybe buzzes to somewhere else  wherever the remote actually is. That is true  yes. Hmm. So I guess it'd be something we could like attach to the or like the same technology could be put inside the inside the remote. Yeah. Yeah if we if we could have it in the actual remote like everything in one one device. you could have an option to turn it off. Or Perhaps  um. So that would solve the problems with the T_V_ kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels. Mm. 'Kay. Yes. Has to be simple enough to I suppose if we could get something in which was quite quick and simple that would give us an advantage over the other remotes. Um. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Yes. Um. Yes that seems right. Mm-hmm. Okay. Maybe we should concentrate just on the whistle back function at the moment  and if something comes back I'd go more Yeah  f more for clap. Did we decide on having the ten um the ten numbers and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together. Okay  ten numbers and then some kind of device to allow uh I'll put delay to allow um multiple numbers. Or multiple digits. Did we decide anything about um the other functions? As in setting the audio and tuning it and stuff like that? You had an had an idea about the menu? But just thinking um people probably I mean you don't have you only have to probably tune in the T_V_ once  but you have to be able to tune it that once. So and if finally the T_V_ breaks  you get a new one  you're gonna have to be able to tune it. You can't really avoid that. Except the new digital markets which do it by themselves. So that'll be in Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah. Yeah. So how would this menu function work? Would you maybe have like one menu button  then you'd use the other buttons  maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions. Okay. we're gonna have the the individual numbers and then a menu function and maybe sort of a slightly more advanced um instruction booklet to come with it  to guide Presu uh I think it'd be quite hard just for people to grasp um just off like the menu use different buttons you maybe have to have like some better instructions of how that would actually work. Right  okay um. that also goes back to the original design when we saw those two  and there was the one on the left hand side which had all like the double functions and stuff which kind of looked too busy and had too much on it  so. That is that is a good idea actually. Sor sort of a second. Okay. Uh not quite  but I guess. Keep the other buttons but hide them away. So So um we're gonna have to have to work out what's gonna be on these other functions as as well. So we're gonna have like two separate two separate lists  I guess. So sh Should we decide in the next couple of minutes  and then So on the about the number. Um the volume up and down. Shall we have a mute button as well? A mute button as well. Yeah. Or But then they might not buy it if they haven't got one. 'Cause people might just be too fickle and not want to change. We can send out a flier with the device saying that you shouldn't leave it on stand-by. I think you probably should. Um are we gonna have the channel up and down as well as the number buttons? Okay  so we'll have um So we've got ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen there? Is there anything else? Um. Maybe if we're gonna run out of time  one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they're gonna be. So tuner up and down  I guess. Um up Tune one way  tune the o I I dunno I dunno possibly. Oh yeah and th and a enter button just to select. Yeah  okay. Um I guess we're keeping s it simple. We don't really need any other audio funct uh functions because it's just volume up  volume down. Um. Do they have their own do they have their own controls on their actual products  then  or do you have to do it via the remote? Yeah I suppose if we've got their if they've got their own controls then we can avoid it for ours just to keep it simple. Oh  okay. Right. Um. Maybe unless something comes up then we should I think Well shall we look into that and just get back together. 'Kay. ,The Industrial Designer presented an analysis of cost and the manufacturing options that were available to the group. The Marketing Expert presented market trends and the organic trend that this project would adopt. She discussed materials that could be used to follow this trend. The User Interface Designer presented several interface concepts including voice recognition  a spinning wheel design  and a touch screen interface. The group then discussed the features of the device. They discussed the costs and benefits of using either voice recognition or the touch screen interface  and decided on voice recognition based on their marketing data that favored it. They decided to use solar power to power the device. The group discussed the non-traditional look the device could have since the voice recognition would allow it to be stationary. They discussed using rubber for the case. The group talked about hiding the complicated functions from the main interface  using rubber for the buttons  and having different cases to suit different tastes. The Project Manager reiterated that the product was being marketed towards the youth market  and then gave out assignments and instructed the group to work together to build the prototype. 
'Kay so we'll try to zip through this  since we're short on time. Welcome everybody. Um hope your sessions went well. Um so this is our functional design meeting  we're going to consider um user needs  technical effects  and the working design of our remote control. Um I've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings  and I'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there. Um I I'll get the ones up for next time  um they're not finished yet. Right. Um so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this sure. Hm? No  any any order's fine. Yeah. Oh yeah  sorry. It sh it takes a few seconds I think. Uh-huh  and then press function. and F_ eight. Here we are. Oh. Is it on? Okay. Hm. 'Kay. Yeah. Just move right on. Uh function F_ eight. It's the little blue w it's the one th yeah. Yeah should be It should be yeah. 'Kay. Okay. Well thank you everybody. Um we have we'll discuss that and then I just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in. Um  teletext is apparently outdated  so due to internet popularity  so that's off the list. Um  also our remote should be used only for television  um  no extra internet kinda fancy things  just the remote and the television. Um and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this  so um the phrase is  we put fashion in electronics  so let's be fashionable I guess. Um if we have something I mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours  so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw  and yellow writing  something like that. Okay. Um. So we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions. Um  yeah. Do Let's I guess we should yeah make some kind of brainstorming  see what we can wha what um well probably our target group and how it's gonna going to appeal to our target group and I dunno the the s the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing. So. I think that seems to yeah. Mm. Yeah  teenagers and young professionals. Oh  uh. Yeah. Mm. And if if you consider our budget  it probably if you consider our budget  to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey. Yeah. Right so um yeah. Yeah. Okay. So you you'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can right. Yeah  yeah. So do you think even though we're not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals. Huh. Okay. Yeah. We probably leave that. I mean I guess one takes care of the other  like um if you can yeah if you can call it then it's Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And like if the if the phone's under the couch  you might not see the light  so yeah. So I mean the two remotes that you had shown r I don't remember who showed them  yeah you you did um  they're I mean one looked like it was for V_C_R_ type thing  and the other looked like just television. Oh really. 'Cause that that is something we have to decide  is whether we want to have V_C_R_ capabilities. They're not no. Yeah  that's right  yeah. But D_V_D_ probably is. And and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers  I mean it's gonna be D_V_D_ type  that's the the technology these days. Yeah. Yeah. S Huh. You know  I've seen some remotes that where you just hold one  like if you hold one down it's it's a different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on. So you don't actually have a separate power button  it's just But It might be confusing. Yeah. Yeah. Besides you like to be able to go power. I have the power I guess. So we definitely want a power button and numbers. Right. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Oh that's gonna Is that like on on a mouse pad where like kind of okay. I've never used one. No. Okay. Okay. Well i We could we could even have four buttons  like  if that's the if that's the mouse  you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as well. Huh. So it's like holding You can o And you you is there an extra actual button? Or are you actually you're just using the mouse to go up and down. Like Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm. Well I mean if if you're gonna this for channels  right  then y wouldn't the volume need to be separate somehow? Like you could just have Oh  like Oh you could actually Yeah. Is that what makes them expensi I think it's all of they have so much memory though  that's it's Yeah. I think it's the uh h it's their capabili I mean they it can hold what like five thousand songs or something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. S Mm. Um You know actually our our new project requirements  I'm not sure if they meant o onl use only for television as in not for D_V_D_ or just not internet type things. So I'll I'll check that and update you on the next But we'll hold off on that 'cause But s yeah uh. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Yeah. But i Yeah. Um  yeah  let's think about it 'cause we need to wrap up. Um let's see. Um so everyone's gonna go finish their questionnaire  uh then when we come back after lunch we'll have thirty minutes of individual work  um yeah  so think about the things we've discussed and bring some new ideas to our next meeting. See you soon. Okay. And I can start if you want. Mm. Is there an order? No. We haven't decided on an order. First. Okay. Um  how do I put this I'll just put the cable in. Is that it? Can you see? Oh  here. Okay. So what happens it doesn't work? No. Is it in the right thing? Oh wait  um. Uh. You need to help me. Yeah. Oh  wait. That's is that it? Right here we are. We're here. Okay  um. In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found  um a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to n know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out. Um  the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about. Custome Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look  they don't like the way they feel  they don't think they match their operating behaviour  and an example is what we were talking about  the buttons  they only use ten per cent of the buttons  so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most and I think we should design according to these buttons. Easy to lose  and R_S_I_. I don't know what R_S_I_ means. Um the person that did the questionnaire obviously did  I don't have a clue. Um  according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons  I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance. So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection. They're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour. And um yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently  so this is the order. Channel selection  teletext  volume  and power. The other ones are the settings  and they're used less than you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour  and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings  and then  just one  and then from there go on to the audio on the screen  either on the remote or on the television. Um  about the screen  and speech recognition  some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that. And if we look at the market  f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds  I don't really know how to describe this  um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product  while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent  so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing. Um I don't I don't know um what the decision to be made is  but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um  most likely  but we should discuss this together. And that's all I have to say about the matter  um. Shall I what do I do? Do I give this to someone else? Function F_ eight. S That's on view. Oh. How it looks or the the buzzer you mean  yeah  for sure  yeah. Well that's for speech recognition. And screen. That's only for speech recognition and screen. Yeah yeah yeah. I mean I just put the values in. But um the screen is the same as what  Yeah  I'm happy with that. Completely. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So do you plug it in the T_ you plug it in T_V_  this thing? Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Just there. Mm. Are we um should that thing be on the thing to put the you s you talking about a home for it. Do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall or shall we leave that for now? Okay. Okay. For the so you have that button  that so there's is there a light or shall we leave just have a radio? Are we just having a radio? On the phone. You don't need a light. Yeah yeah yeah. Yeah yeah. You can hear it's under the couch yeah. Um  So need the other buttons. So we have this mm. Mm-hmm. They're not  no. It not V_H_S_ here? But V_C_R_s Yeah. Yeah  for sure. Well for sure we need the um I think we can just design the channels? I mean power's just a button  and it's not used that much  s and it's usually that red and I think it's quite nice to keep it like red. Oh okay  yeah. Yeah. Well even um iPod thing  like um  I don't know if people like this but if you want to reduce the number  of buttons  instead of having like one to nine  have a sort of scrolling I don't know. Yeah. Because people li seem now the iPod's out people seem to like this thing that there's no Know you don't have one two three four five Yeah yeah  it's just and it's one thing which has everything. Well can't it tell the like can't you if you you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then It's like l this like that  and then you do that. And then you can have um if you actually just want to zap  you can have like a thing like that  and that  and then it can just be plus and minus. Yeah  you can Yeah  click o actually click on to have Yeah. What do you mean the function? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah but it knows for some reason. The iPod knows. Well for the volume you have to press the middle  and then go up. And then well if you do that it goes  but if you like that makes more sense 'cause there's already ones with up and down here  that I've seen. Well what you for the iPod you press an w right if you're on the channel let's say  then you press on the middle and then if you do that again the volume goes up  and if you do that it goes down. But if you wanna keep it with volume here and here  I'm pretty sure Yeah. I don't know  you could click and then have it up and down  but I think Yeah yeah yeah. I think it Yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah. Well it could just be simple instead of being a l mass. Because  the other thing  I didn't tell you all my presentation  is that people find it find that it's a big waste of time to have to learn how to use your remote and that's another thing they complained about. Um  what other buttons were there? Volume oh we've ts just said that. Channel selection. Menu. But D_V_D_ players usually have their own remote. Yeah  yeah  yeah. Yeah. Yeah  it is only fun Okay. Who's that?. Could you just plug it back into hers because she had oh. Right. So get this. Okay so now I need to press F_ eight  what is it? 'Kay. What's function? Oh function  I see it. There we go. Okay. Um. This my presentation about the uh technical functions design and I basically just tried to focus on um just what what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user. So uh and I just sort of like thought about it myself and looked on the internet. And okay so basically um I think i uh like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way. Um so I think things like uh you know keeping buttons together that like close together that um are used in the same way  uh or um maybe that making 'em the same colour  keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum  and also things like is it is it um is it uh can you c y small enough large enough I'm not sure we c I guess we would need to do some research about  I would  about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing  um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the T_V_. Does it have like capacity to change the channels? Um does it do or do we need to have like functions for cable or V_C_R_? And then  is it findable  and uh how do we wanna do that? And um I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring  um I dunno if this will work but And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those. Just I mean I like the one on the right better  just because it does have fewer buttons  uh but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like um like colour and you know size  shapes  that sort of thing  to best fit the user. That concludes my presentation. Okay. You need the little thingy. Ooh. Do you know about like I dunno  you seem like you know about Okay. Cool. Like in terms of how it looks  or like what it does? Okay. Yeah. Okay. So Is our target group then people so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button? So Okay. So the yeah  yeah  yeah. So then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range  what was it? Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hu yeah. Okay so are we gonna have just some kind of a like we'll have the buzzer on the som like on the T_V_ itself. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Alright. Okay. So it's now like a two-part thing. Okay. Alright. So we get to design that too. Make it fashionable. Um  okay. Yeah. Then it can live anywhere. Yeah. T So i Yeah. That was that was me. I think w I think they're both sort of just like general remo they're both general remotes. And uh Yeah. S Um Yeah. So. Okay  let's see if I can I think still though  it shouldn't be that hard to take like just reduce the number of buttons you know  like 'cause if you just have like one menu button  that works like with a you know  or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the T_V_. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It seems like that would be hard though. I mean  like because unless you know yeah. Just 'cause I wouldn't I would probably pick it up and just be like uh why is there no on button. Yeah. B Yeah. Yeah. That sort of like joystick flat touch thing  yeah. Yeah  yeah. I think that's an interesting idea  'cause it's cool  it's it's funny like you f like I just I don't have an iPod but like I  you know  I just like started messing around with one of my friend's the other day  and you just sort of and it's funny how you pick it up and you just figure out how to use it quite easily  like it's not that hard  you know. Yeah  and it is yeah. It is really but do you need a screen then  do you have to have a screen then? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay so we have this like scrolling sort of button. Like a disc. Yeah. Yeah. It's like it's just like the same technology as a mouse pad. Yeah. Yeah and then. Okay. So like it's like a little part of the circle that Or it oh so it's just a region of the circle that you can zap. Okay. Yeah. So volume could be like the top it and the bottom So do you need to okay. Well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like I mean like okay  'cause so I dunno  I guess Okay so when you g scroll your thumb like around it  it'll s like say you're go you're going clockwise. That that means you're gonna go up the channels  and then you scroll the other way and it'll go down. But then so if you wanna switch to the to u do you have to switch to a function where like y so you're either in that mode or you're in the mode where like it just has like the four like you know this is channel that way  that's that way and volume is up and down. It just It just kno the iPod knows. S Yeah. So you just you just can either do this or like you can just touch it if you want. Okay. That's what I mean. Okay. Okay so you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up  go up and down. It's like a b Like I think we can go on the fact that it does just work with the iPod. But the only thing is like  iPods are so expensive  like  it has to be is that part of yeah  I dunno  I dunno. You don't think so? Okay. Okay. Yeah. I'm thinking we could if if we're hav So ba I mean but an iPod just has that circle thing you know. Yeah. Yeah. Well like since it just has the circle thing  you could make it a qui a kind of cool shape  like it could be a cool sort of you know  because it could be circular  you know  or something weird like that  just Yeah. Yeah. So okay. This is just for T_V_  it's not for or it is does need to be compatible with Yeah. So how do you switch Okay. So like if we had that Yeah. That's true  yeah. So  I know I'm not c really clear on what Yeah  yeah. So you'd have to have like I think you would have to have like a function switch button  you know somewhere so like you can you're either on T_V_  you're on D_V_D_ or you're on V_C_R_  or you're like. So Yeah  but I mean like to switch the fun so like to switch the function of the little circle disc  the touch pad. Yeah but it it would be So but I'm saying like  does it make sense to have like some kind of a button  so like you're if you're on T_V_  like you can switch channels  but then if uh if you're on D_V_D_ then like the channel bu like the the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks or s you know  to different I mean do we need to think about that  that like Just uh You may need to But sometimes you have to do it it's like a three set setting cycle  so press it a couple times  hold down function and then press F_ eight. Adjusting. The cable might be a little loose or something. Oh  you got it. How do I um Right. Okay so this is on the working design  which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote  um and the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting. Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions  the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T_V_. And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the T_V_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is. So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote  um input which would probably be buttons  although um we just talked about voice recognition  processor to take the information  um something to transmit it to the T_V_  and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output  like possibly a beep or a vibration. And also you need a sender for location signal  which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their T_V_ or stick it on their wall. And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works. Power comes from the battery  goes to the chip  um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the T_V_. And then for the location function  you would have a sender on the T_V_ which would output some sort of signal  um we could use I_R_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead. That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it  and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up. Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh  battery for the energy source  that way you wouldn't have to plug it in  um a button pad for input  um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff  I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the T_V_  that's just sort of standard  um so most T_V_s have an I_R_ receiver. Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself. So that concludes my presentation. Mm? Yeah  uh I d I was an engineer before I came here. It's easy to implement. Locator. Well I was thinking about that but uh I mean speech recognition is really hard to programme  and also  if the T_V_ is on it's making sound and the people on the T_V_ are talking  and if somebody says like one  then the T_V_'s gonna switch itself to channel one  or it seems like a silly  I'm not sure how you would implement it. It's a cool idea but Well you would have to have a button on a T_V_ or on your wall or some place since the T_V_ already has power. Yeah you click the button  it's gonna send out a signal  and I was thinking  I_R_ is line of sight  so unless the remote is like actually in front of the T_V_ it's not gonna work  um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone. Sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably. It would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote. Yeah  it'd probably just stick it on your T_V_ so if you need to find the remote  click the button. Yeah  so it would be a two part package. Yeah I think so. Um on the T_V_ or on the phone? Um it seemed like a a beep seemed the most reasonable to me  I think that's what the phone has  I mean when you need to find your phone  you just have someone call it and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever. Does anyone know if V_C_R_s are the same across international? Okay  so you'd need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody's V_C_R_s. Yeah  other than that region and coding thing. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah  I never think to hold something down. Yeah  you can have the number going around in the corner. Doesn't it rotate though  so it'll be moving around. Mm-hmm. If it works on an iPod then it works. I don't have one. Oh. Yeah. I don't think so. I don't think it's the wheel dealy. Yeah.. And they're re-programmable aren't they? You can put on your songs and then put on a different set  that's probably why they're expensive  they're like little computers. Mm-hmm. I A D_V_D_ is simple  you just have play  pause  eject  and menu maybe. Oh yeah. But it's cool to have it all on one  because you wanna turn it on then you wanna turn up the volume  and then you wanna go to the menu  so you don't wanna switch. Well but D_V_D_ is only like four buttons. Oh. But I think the circle only does channel isn't applicable to D_V_D_ really 'cause you don't wanna but volume is and volume is actually controlled on the T_V_ so you don't have to switch. Yes we can try that. ,The project manager opens the meeting by going through notes from the last meeting  recapping the topics covered. He tells them some new project requirements given by management. The marketing expert presents  talking about user functionality requirements taken from research of 100 people. They discuss the possibility of making a remote that hides less frequently used buttons  one that uses voices recognition to eliminate buttons altogether  or one that combines the two functions. The interface specialist presents  showing examples of two different products- one that is user-centered and another that is engineering-centered and giving personal preference to the simpler one because it is easier to use and has fewer buttons. Next the industrial designer presents  explaining how a remote control works and giving personal preference to a remote which has a large energy source such as a rechargable battery or battery dock. The group discusses using a battery that will last 5-10 years or a solar combined with a battery. They briefly review their discussions and close the meeting. 
Okay. Right. Okay. Alright. Is everyone here? Okay. This is our conceptual design meeting. And I'll just take a few minutes and uh go through the previous minutes. Um then each of you will have your presentation  um and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control. And then we'll have uh forty minutes for finishing up. Um I'll go through the mee through the minutes first. Um  we just refreshed our our uh goal of making the finest remote control available. Um we decided that  or we know that we need to use company colours  company logo. Um and our Marketing Expert uh gave us some i uh information from interviews with a hundred different remote users. Um with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before. People thought their remotes were ugly  um um that remotes zap a lot. Um they only use uh a finite amount of buttons. Um and that they often lose the it's easy to lose a remote. Um which were all things we were thinking we would wanna make it simple. Um And uh some sort of locator. Either a button or tracking device. Um And that it should look different than what's out there. Um Kind of mixed mixed response on the speech recognition. The younger people said they wanted it  older people did not. Um uh I think we decided that um the expense was not necessarily worth it  and that it was probably a gimmick  that um would increasingly wear on the consumers' nerves. Um Then the User Interface Designer um explored some of the technical functions of the remote. Um the simple versus the um the complex. The simple one being better for a user  the complex better for an engineer. Um Um and some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be a user-oriented remote  something simple. Um and that we didn't wanna go with a universal remote  because uh increasing cost and increasing complexity. Um we would just have a T_V_ remote. Um and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote. Have it s be something that looks different. And finally our um Industrial Designer uh gave us a rundown of how the remote will work. Um from energy source  um uh what we would use. Batteries because we don't wanna have a a cable. Um How that would power the remote and the lamp. If we were to to have one. Uh um the user interface then would connect to a chip  which would work with the infrared controls uh to send the signal to the T_V_. Um I believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be. Um Um something that will fit into uh easily into someone's hand. And with a  just a few buttons. Just the basics. And with a scrolling um function also. Okay and I will leave that  leave it at that. So Marketing? We're watching trends. I suppose that you can have this. A banana shape? So possibly like a uh  sorry  just to butt in for a second. Possibly uh like a cover like they have for mobile phones? You have one with a flag  and one with a banana and one that's a spongy feel to it. You can Mm various covers. We could leave that to the cover department. We all know they've got nothing to do all day. Notice the giant dog bone shape? Also good for animals. What's the approximate per hundred thousand for the titanium? Works well in Arizona but in Edinburgh not so No I think I think batteries are probably the way to go. Yeah. So the ru wait the rubbery we can shape it however we want? Or the rubbery we cannot? 'Kay. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Is that an option  a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots? What about a smell? T to the remote? Yellow and grey. Grapefruit. I would say  if I were to make a decision  I would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectrum of of importance. Um Well perhaps the implied shape will be enough to lure that fruit-minded remote buyer. It's it's yellow. It's curved. It's sort of couple of couple of grey stripes. We could put the grey stripes on the bottom so that that person could turn it over. It would look like a banana just sitting on their table. Rather than rather th Maybe the holder  if we were to have a holder  it could be shaped like a fruit. Could be  it could be an ape or a fruit bowl. Hey we could have a variety of options here. Do you have more to your presentation? Oh. Okay. I'm gonna plug in here real quick. If I could. Like I said we have to make a decision on a couple of these items here. Um ow. Ow. Mm-hmm. Okay. Uh so these are the decisions that we do need to make by the end of this meeting. Um for our components concept we need to come up with the energy source  um the chip-on-print  and the case. Probably case um material. And probably a shape also. Um and then for the user interface concept we need to decide what the tape  what  what the type is. And what kind of supplements we'll have. Um Energy source I think we've  I think we've decided batteries  although not exciting  are probably our best bet. And we have five minutes. 'Kay. So Um I guess we should pick the case then. If we go with the plasticky case  or the the plastic case  um then the chip-on-print is still kind of  we could have either or. We could have a complex one or a a non-complex. But did we decide that the rubbery feel was important enough to us?. Okay. So we would  we would have the L_C_D_ screen? 'Kay. So I guess the case would be plastic  with Perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it. It's more of a su it's more of a supplement maybe. Which will require a more expensive chip-on-print right? 'Kay. So I guess that  is that  is that about it? So we have a good idea of what we're gonna need to to do on this? Um okay so we will have another meeting in thirty minutes. Um Here's what's gonna be going on. Um Um Ryan you'll be working on the user interface design. Um Manuel you'll be working on the look-and-feel design. Corrine we'll want a product evaluation. And the two of you get to play with the uh modelling components and uh maybe and and get us a prototype. Which should go along well with your look-and-feel design and your interface. So that basically just be working on the prototype  uh we'll accomplish your other two actions. Alright. Okay. Let's do it. Yep. Oh it was sort of banana shaped. Those like  yeah  sort of spongy ones. What's it called? Cust you personalised  yeah. Yeah. Okay. Why can't I see the crazy. Um yeah I talking about the interface concept and how the customer relates to  will use the  consumer will use the actual device. Um so I've looked at some of the stuff I was sent  um  try and get some inspiration. But keep in mind that our own ideas that we had. Um I was sent some information from the company saying that they  the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology  where you can program questions into such devices. They gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question  you program the answer  and the machine responds accordingly. Um okay. There's different ways of a user can use products l like a remote. Um there's a graphical use  where you you look at pictures and well on a screen. A command line where you obviously type things in  and you get a response. Um and then it ju that's just to point out the sort of inconsistent u sort of use of interface in remotes. You can't really see that picture well  but there's various different remotes  once again with lots of different buttons on  making it more complicated. So  then I had a look at new products that are on the market. Not necessarily remote controls but ones that you'll recognise. Um this is the voice  there is a voice recognition remote control  which can control mus multiple devices. I have a there is a picture. You surf your favourite channels uh with your voice. Store up to eighty speech samples  controls four devices  T_V_  cable  satellite  V_C_R_  D_V_D_ and audio. And you can record your own v verbal labels  that are connected to remote control functions. So the technology is there. Um the one on the left is very similar to what we drew up on the board in the previous meeting  where there has scroll down functions on the side. You can sort of just make those out. And then on the right is obviously an iPod  which is you know possibly one of the simplest things to use out there  and really is  and all that is is just a a nice big scroll menu that y you sort of go through. That is a possibility. And nothing's simpler really. Um then there's things like this  which is a a a kid's remote  where the the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before. So the remote control it o only allows them to access the channels that their parents want them to watch. And um it means that th children have a novelty of having their own remote control. So I don't know if there's a possibility of having one remote contr you know like we just had two components  maybe it can have more components you know  different remotes. Um the point made at the end there here is that you have to be sort of be need to be clear on your um devices  as to what  you know  things you use. Sometimes an arrow pointing down  which may suggest volume down  could become confused just as a V_ for volume. Just little things like that  which would need to be made clear in the design. Um I think  d carrying on from what I've already said  a user friendly remote with minimum buttons. Maybe we've so suggested this two-part thing  where if it was to have a speech recognition thing  you could maybe control that on the do it or program all that on the control bit. And then just have the simple sort of hand-held thing that we sort of devised earlier  as the actual remote. Um I don't it could be a graphical display  the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an iPod where you just sort of control through the menus. Stuff like gets more and more compli complicated. And then the the hand-held bit should be ergonomically designed. And that is it. Why am I Oh yeah. Just. Where are we? Uh. Just to sort of show you. M they've even got things like that. Huge things. Which is just for your gr ninety year old grandma yeah? Yeah. Yeah. And that yeah. Yeah. See. things.. Why's my screen crazy? Mm. Would you have to leave it by the window? yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Would the sort of spongy and the the plasticky thing y you can get those mobile phones that initially have a it is plastic but then they have sort of a a s a cover on it which is just sort of soft and stuff. So I don't know if that would still be possible to have you know in plastic. But then where do people hold it? Just all be sort of spongy. So you as the the possibility of having a a graphical display on it  like a screen? Like the iPod? Right. Yeah. Yeah. Could we not you know have a shape with a scroll and the screen  and then j just sort of that initial shape we had  just which is uh sort of banana-esque. So that's thing if we did it yellow. And um you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit. They wouldn't have any they're just on the exterior. They wouldn't be necessary to the actual shape of the thing. Yeah. Mm. You could just sell it in different colours as well I suppose. In different ye yellows. I don't suppose we have to stick to co Stick to the colours yeah. Mm grapefruit. Yeah.. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. and if it if it was done yellow  which is a company colour. Yeah. On the the gr the rubbery grips could be grey. Yeah. It could and then you could actually h put the banana-shaped thing on the fruit bowl  on the coffee table  and then people would always know where it was. Yeah. Yeah. Well we sort of rid of that because gonna use a battery. And the base station might not be necessary. Yeah. Yeah. Just just maybe yeah. Just a little bit of. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah I think so. I think . Yep. Okay. Yep. Can I have your cable please? Thanks. Okay so I was looking at trend-watching. Um unfortunately I wasn't given too much information. I was given a brief executive summary  and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at. And then I'll just tell you some personal preferences that I got from that. Um okay the most important finding was that the fancy look-and-feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look-and-feel design  which I think we've kind of already discussed before. Um the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative. And again these are all things we've kind of already come up with on our own  but this just backs it up. And thirdly the remote would be easy to use. As far as fashion update  we've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths  shoes and furniture. So that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote  but we can try. Um and also  as opposed to last year  this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel. Okay so from that um  as we've already said  we need to focus on a fancy look-and-feel. Um I think we've already discovered that it's kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design. But I think that  even if it's very subtle  we need to kind of trick our consumers  so they at least get the idea that they're getting something that's new and modern and sleek and Whether it's through the shape or the colours or all of that. Um for technologically innovative  we've talked about the tracking device. We brought up the idea of having two pieces  which we could discuss further. And Manuel had suggested um the energy source and the user interface  discussing some of those  um that we could change a little bit. We need to keep it simple  have limited buttons  which I think the two piece idea might be really beneficial for. Um we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables. I don't know  I mean I guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Or with exterior designs. But my question is  I mean the stereotypically speaking  you kind of picture males with their remote controls  and I'm not sure how they'd feel about having fruity logos on the outside. So maybe we could have something that's somewhat removable  or I don't know  different options for female  male target groups. And then the spongy feel. I guess we could look at mobile phones and other technology that's out there. C and look at different types of material that might please our users who want spongy-feeling remote controls. So that's that. That's what I was thinking yeah. Yeah. So when you buy your remote you can buy various coverings. Personalise your remote. Mm-hmm. Dunno. Spongy? Y probably not yeah. Mm. No. Hmm. Mm. Like a covering. Yeah. The we can have the fruits and vegetables on the spongy parts  so they can remove it. Mm. Mm. Bright citrus colours yeah. Oh yeah. Yellow and grey. I think having a shape could be a little ridiculous  like Well we kinda do yeah. And if it's yellow? Grey buttons yeah. Mm. Oh. Nice. Could look like a fruit bowl. 'Kay. So is the two piece idea out? Or have we not decided? Oh right okay. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Well what about what you said  like putting the finger grips just on top of the plastic? Yeah. So then for the scroll  are we going for the iPod type? Yeah? Okay. Alright. That's industrial design for cranes  stuff like that. Makes sense  makes sense. Uh Well let's see. I'm going to bore you with a couple of descriptions of the interior. Just to to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there  and that we do have to fit the stuff in there. I've more information on possible materials um as well. What we can and cannot do. Um but let's just wait for this to load up and I'll show you what we're talking about here. Okay. The details of the components' design  as you can see there  what we have is the board  main board of the remote control. The underside  that's pretty cheap piece of of technology really top left side you can see the chip  which is the  what we were talking about  this was is the device to recognise the signals the input  and it passes it on to a row of um further transistors and stuff like that on the right side that actually amplify the signal  which later on is being  is being transferred to a infrared lamp which then um of course shines infrared light onto the television which then will recognise what signal um it's getting and will do what you tell it. Um So much for the the workings of the of the uh remote control itself. Its job is to wait for you to press a key  then to translate that key press into infrared light signals  um that are received by the television. When you press a key um you complete a specific connection. The chip senses the connection and knows what button you pressed. It produces a morse code line signal specific to that button. Right. Pretty clear. Transistor amplifies the signal and then sends the m sends the signal to the L_E_D_ which translates the signal into infrared light. The sensor in the T_V_ can see the infrared light  and seeing the signal reacts appropriately. This is the circuit board from the other side. Um the lower part of it  I don't know if you can see that properly  with the green greenish board is is what we what we saw in the first the first slide just flipped over. Um you can see the circuit board itself. That's the cheapest uh way to make electronic connections basically on the market. Um what you do is you have  don't have cables  but you have the connections actually in these in these lines on the on the board. These are the actual keys that are being pressed. They close the electric circuit. That then sends the signal to the chip on the other side. That would be behind here. Um which uh sends it over to the transistors and all that stuff that amplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared lamp up there. Now as you can see this is the the rubber button version of it. Um the way it works is that you have the keys here. The rubber button has a little metal uh plate on the other side  which closes the circuit here. And thus gives on the signal. Now this is the simple version. Um we are talking um this this the simple and cheapest version at the same time. We are talking something more complicated of course  it's going to be more expensive as well. And not only that. Um we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell  or in the material that we could use for our outer shell. Um I've gotten some information that we could use for the case material plastic  rubber  as well. Um rubber that is used in these anti-stress balls. So it's pretty squishy. That would that would serve that purpose. Um we could also use wood  or titanium. Oh fya I don't have an information on that. However our company obviously can provide us with uh with the titanium  so I assume  I'm  I was given an okay to use it. It certainly is an expensive material  I'm aware of that  but I was given an okay. But there are certain restrictions to certain materials. Now let's first go through the list with the materials. So we what we can use is plastic  rubber  wood and titanium. Can also mix these. Um as for the energy source  um we were talking about that shortly in the other meeting. Um what we could use is  or what I was offered  or what we could use  is a basic bateer battery. Right? Uh a dynamo. Interestingly enough. Um we could use solar cells. Or a device that was not n not further specified that provides kinetic energy. Such as like watches you know. Where you just move them m move the the actual device and this pr uh provides it with with uh some energy. So um obviously I personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really. You don't wanna wind up your remote control before you can use it right? Um solar cell is interesting. May fail though  every here and there. Mm. Yeah. Or you know you lose it  it lies behind the couch for a week and yeah mm. Always the you But exactly. Um the kinetic energy thing um might work  um but the same problem. You leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work. So I'd say what we're stuck with really is um the basic battery. Which also makes a base station basically obsolete. We don't need that then. Um However our interface options are push-buttons. In which uh in the production of which or in manufacture of which um our company is expert. Um However we've discussed that scroll wheels are a better option. And they are possible. We have an okay for scroll wheels. Okay. Um however when it comes to the scroll wheel of the iPod I've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an L_C_D_ into the remote control as well. This however may exclude certain um materials. If you have a squishy uh kind of remote control  then an L_C_D_ screen may be affected by the movement. Hence we might not be able to put it in there. So um There's also restrictions to  when it comes to the chip. If we have a more sophistic uh sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic uh set-up that we that I've just presented  um the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well. I don't have any details to  when it comes to the cost but um it will be a significant difference. I'd rather say drop the titanium and therefore let's have a more sophisticated chip  but that's not up to me to decide really. So that's for the for the scroll wheel. Um it limits our choice and squishy is hip  so I'd say rather not go for for that. Let's see now. Um um solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex um surface or um remote control. But obviously that's not our problem um since we have decided or against solar cells  I assume right? Or is anybody still alright. Alright. Uh which makes it very conventional but therefore traditional I assume. Um Um With the titanium um we cannot make it a curved design. We would just be able to make it flat and and um yeah a straight design pretty much. Which I assume would exclude uh some of the more sophisticated versions. You can have an L_C_D_ screen. Um but therefore no rubber will be used. Alright? So plastic yes  titanium yes  but this will of course influence the form. With plastic  as I understand it  you can use any form. Um latex is tricky. Or rubber and um and titanium also seems to be tricky when it comes to the form. So the way to go is if you want a scroll wheel you either make it flat and angular  uh add an L_C_D_ screen  and um then you can basically choose either plastic or titanium. Or wood even. Um if you wanna make it a particular shape  use plastic. Add an L_C_D_ screen  add a scroll wheel  that'll be fine. Or make it just push-buttons. Basically plastic gives you the b biggest variety of of options. Maybe not the nicest feel. Or not much originality really. With rubber we could uh sh pretty much shape it the way we wanted it  but we cannot add scroll wheels  and we cannot add an L_C_D_ screen. That's the tricky thing. S Certainly can be done yes. Um yeah. if that doesn't affect the functional side of it all. Like say just the underside or so then it can be done. I assume. Yeah. So The fruit design um How about um affecting the surface of the actual um remote control? Say we don't make it p a particular fruit shape obviously  but uh give it like the surface of an orange  banana  whatever. You name it. Just design-wise. Mm. Nice one. Mm. Well we we're supposed to stick to the company colours though  that's yellow and grey. So what have we  lemon  banana  is Grapefruit is what we'd go for  when it comes to the outer appearance perhaps. But mm. Well we have it banana-shaped already  kind of. So Right. I it's yellow. Well so why not add a couple of grey stripes and make it look like a banana? There you go. It could be an ape. Yeah. That's pretty much it. I informed you about the materials  what the interior has to look like  and what the limitations to certain materials are on there you go. Sure. Hang on. There you go. Well we can still design a two-piece uh remote um without having a base  having one of them be a base station  but just have it be an optional either big remote with lots of functions  or you take out the smaller piece. We can still do that. However of course this would be like designing two remotes pretty much. So um which then  as I understand it  would probably limit the  limit again the the the use of certain materials  because they would be too expensive. Say like have a scroll wheel and uh on both of them  or have an L_C_D_ screen and so on so on. You'd probably have to stick rather with a just traditional rubber button design which we saw there. But could be done  of course. Right. Okay when it comes to the chip-on-print  as I said  the the more advanced features you want  um the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive. Uh if you want just a normal button version  the chip-on-print is gonna be a cheap one. Right? Yeah. as long as the pla uh the rubber is nowhere near the controls  yes.. M more of a l lamination perhaps. Yes. It does. Right. Right. ,Then the project manager opens the meeting announcing that they will address conceptual design and then giving the agenda. Matthew arrives late and the marketing expert begins her presentation about trends. She emphasizes that the remote needs to be exciting  contain a cool feature  and be somewhat intuitive. She reports that currently fruits and vegetables are fashionable- thus bright eye-catching colors  bold designs  and a spongy feel is appropriate. She lists ideas such as changable covers  a locator  speech recognition  and LCD screens. The industrial specialist presents  talking about how a remote typically has different keys  structures and forms. He likes the idea of implenting speech recognition into a universal remote. They discuss without certainity about the cost of such functions. The industrial designer presents about remote control components and the manufacturing process  listing options such as various buttons  scroll wheels  integrated push buttons like those in a computer mouse  and LCDs.  They discuss the project budget and the possibility of using an expensive chip. They decide to make two designs  one more advanced than the other. The project manager closes the meeting by telling each group member what his/her tasks will be until the next meeting. 
Okay okay Okay. Hello. Okay. My name's Poppy. I'm the Industrial Designer for this project. Um  I'm going to be responsible for the functional design phase. Also the conceptual design and the detailed design for the final product. Okay. Okay. So this is a television remote control? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Got those notes. Okay. Okay. Oh  to go first. Oh  are we all doing it individually? Okay  let's stand up and support you Okay. Do you have elk where you come from? You do. Okay. Sheep. Yeah  cows. That's a great elk. Yeah. Brilliant. Mm. Very nice. Okay. Okay  I'll go next. I am a big animal lover. I like all sorts of animals  but for the moment I'm gonna draw a cat  in memory of my poor cat that died recently. It's gonna be a bit of a strange drawing  but never mind. Not as artistic as Heather's drawing. Bit more cartoon style. But I like cats because they're so independent  and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing. Um  but that doesn't mean they're completely not sociable  'cause they enjoy interacting with humans as well  and they seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and  um  running around outside as well as being inside  and enjoying their food  and generally just  they just seemed so cool and they just know what they're doing. Uh I reckon they're sort of  they got it sorted. They know what they want. Basically  that's why I like cats. I'll rub that out. There you go. Ooh. Well there are loads of different types of dogs  so I'm sure it'll represent one kind of dog. We can pretend. Okay. Yeah  that's true. Very nice. Okay. Okay. I always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing. It's always  where is the remote control? So maybe if you could have some kind of tracking device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was. I dunno  some kind of alarm. You can press a button on your wall  signal  'cause it always gets lost. Yeah. Yeah  that you don't use half of them. Yeah  that's  that's Yeah  it is. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. A novelty. Are we going into kind of novelty factors here. Like  I've seen phones like a Okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I suppose  if we're he heading to have it  like make a huge profit out of this  it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing. Like  a novelty thing might only sell a few things rather than  like  a general kind of more acceptable But we don't wanna go towards boring  'cause that wouldn't sell either. So  hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Industrial Designer. That's me. Mm-hmm. Okay. Thank you. You may have to do the function F_ eight thing. Oh  okay. Hi  I'm Genevieve. I'm the Marketing Expert. I'm an expert at marketing. Um  I'll be telling you guys about the user requirement specifications for our new product. Um  I'll be doing some trend-watching in the conceptual design  and product evaluation for the design phase. Yeah. Thank you. We have moose too. Uh-oh  we have a good artist. Oh  very shapely. Oh. Tara or Tara. That's Pinocchio. Alrighty. I feel like a robot. Okay. Um  well I guess I had the most time to think about it. I'm going to draw a butterfly  because I saw a butterfly yesterday  that seemed to be like the symbol of Spring arriving. And it was actually the prettiest butterfly I've ever seen out in the wild  and I though that was pretty cool in Scotland. It was like  well it was a little pointier than that. At first I thought it was a dead leaf. And then it landed on the wall next to me. But this part was all brown and then it has these big blue dots like this. And then it kinda there was a green  I think it was a green ring  and there was like red going out like this. Yeah  it kinda was actually  'cause it was This part of the body was really dull  and then it was the most colourful exotic butterfly ever  and I'm like  wow this is the middle of Scotland in like March. So I thought that was pretty cool. And it landed by a wall and let me look at it for about two minutes. I wish I'd had my camera. So that's gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like Spring is finally here. Yeah. There you go. Uh  what do we Oh. Yes I do. Okay  so we'll have a hundred percent profit then? Twelve fifty. Okay. I find that in the dark it's often hard to know what button you're pushing. Um Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. There's some remote controls where there's kind of a hidden panel  so all those buttons that you don't really use unless you're programming or something. That's useful. So you just have like the number buttons  power button  T_V_ video button. Could be shaped like a conch  you know. Be like a shell-shaped remote.. Interface? Oh  industrial. Marketing Expert. My name's Tara and I'm the User Interface Designer. I will also be responsible for the functional design phase  the conceptual design phase and the detailed design phase of the user interface design. Gosh. Yeah. An elk? A vicious We have sheep. That is really good. I'm quite Very good. Okay. I think my favourite animal would be a dog  but I'm not really sure how to draw one. I  I've never drawn a dog  I don't think. I'm tempted to draw a snail 'cause I draw them sometimes and they're really easy to draw. Um  right it's gonna be a really funny dog  'cause I'm not sure how to draw a dog. It's a cartoon dog I think. A s I don't ev Oh  oh well. It's a scary cartoon dog. That This  that does not look like a dog. I'm sorry. How do you draw a dog? I suppose it has a lon Oh my god. Right. Yous know what it's supposed to be. It's a dog.. Um  I like dogs because  um  they're so good to humans  like they can be trained to be police dogs and seeing-eye dogs  and they're just such friendly animals. And  like they're more of a companion than cats. I've nothing against cats. Cats don't really like me  so I can't like them. But they're just so friendly and warm and nice animals  that don't look like that. Yeah. Do yous not find that  um  like  there's a lot of  um  buttons on your remote control  and you don't know what half of them do. Yeah  I don't know what they do. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Alright  that did nothing. Okay. Welcome to the meeting everyone. Just gonna attempt to make this into a slide show. Sorry guys. I did. Twice. This'll just take a moment. Or it won't. Okay we'll have to deal with it like this then. Alright. Um. This is the first meeting uh for developing our  our new product. I'm Heather  I'm your Project Manager. Okay. So um. So that was the opening. The first thing we'll do is get acquainted with one another. If everyone could go around and explain their role and um  and their name. Nice to meet you Poppy. Alright. Alright I'm Heather and I've I said I'm your Project Manager  um Well you can pretty much read what it is that I'm doing. But um um Yeah. And uh tool training is one thing that we're going to be doing today  um um as well as planning the project  how we're going to  uh  create this product  and  um  discuss  um  our aims and objects of this  uh Which brings us to our next subject  is  um  um  as a team we're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control. Um  we want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy  um  a completely new style  so that  um  can really appeal to a  to a generation that doesn't want a simple plain kind of  uh  channel-changer. And  um  it needs to be user-friendly for  um  maybe  for an example  for people that  um  can't see the numbers as well  or  um  perhaps an ergonomic design. Yes  it's a television remote control. Right. I believe I should be taking minutes on this right now. So  alright. Um  yeah. Um  the way that we're going to go about this is  um  we'll have a time where we can  um come up with new ideas alone  and  and work on the project and then  um  after we've brainstormed and  and thought about  we can come together in a meeting and  and discuss what  what um  what kind of functional design we want to use. Same with conceptual design and detailed design. So  um  making sure that it  it's usable  that as a  um and that it's  it's feasible to create  and uh  to come up with a concept of it want  what we want it to look like. Um  tool training. Is  is everyone  um Okay. Great. Great. Um One thing that  uh  we're going to do is become more acquainted with the  the tools that we have access to for our project. Um  one of them is our whiteboard. And  um  as a sort of team-building moment  um  I  I'd like us to  um  try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal and the charac characteristics of that animal. Um  why that  why that should be your favourite animal. So  um  I  I'm assuming that we should do that now. 'Kay. With our microphones still attached to our bodies. Okay. 'Kay  what's my favourite animal? Do come up. This is a team-building time where  um   okay cool  um My favourite animal  which changes all the time  okay  right now it is an elk. alright  so And it goes like Yeah it's got like big antlers  yeah. Looks kinda like  like it has holly growing out of its head. Yes. Yeah we have moose and we have deer. Do you have 'Kay  um. Thanks. This is my Okay. That's a sketching of my my elk  and it  it is my favourite animal right now  'cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature  that um  that um In a way it looks kind of awkward  because it's on spindly legs and it uh But it can really overcome harsh terrain  and although it's gorgeous it's also very dangerous  because it has um strong antlers  and uh it can really combat its enemies  even like it it's a it's an herbivore but  uh  it can really defend itself. Yeah. Right. Right  I'm gonna take minutes while  um  you guys express your favourite animals. Oh. Great. I forget her name. It looks kinda like a person. It's kinda like a peacock. Great. Do you hear the eraser buzzing while you do that? Yea Right. So  now that we know how to use the whiteboard  um  the next  um  thing we need to address is our financial department  to meet our our budget  um or not meet our budget but more  um  like what kind of  uh  selling range we'll be looking at  um  wanna make this um selling price of twenty five Euros. And so we have to  um  come up with a way to  to create a  a uh remote control  where um we can like the price to create it will be significantly less. Um  we'd like to  um to  uh  make fifty million Euro. I'm assuming that's what the M_ means. Um  and make it for an international market. Um  one thing we'd have to think about internationally is in the design of  um  like different kinds of  uh  V_C_R_s. Things like that  depending on which country you are. Another thing for the design team to think about. Um  we want it to cost  uh  absolute maximum of twelve Euro and fifty cents. I'm bad at math. 'Kay. Um  so now that  um  that is underway  um it is discussion time. So this is time for us to bring our initial ideas  any um suggestions that you may have so far  a um your personal experiences with remote controls  and um  um  areas you see that  uh  could be improved in your experience with them. Does anyone have any initial thoughts? Mm-hmm. So what's something we could  uh  do to remedy that? Yeah. It's a great idea. It's a great idea. Alright. Anything about  um  the look of the  uh  remote control that you might have ideas about. Maybe it could be  instead of like a standard rectangular shape  it could be  um  something more interesting like Any ideas will do that you have at this point. Can hold it. Yeah. Well if it's a trendy original  um  aspect we're going for. I mean  you're the designers  you c  you can um decide what kind of  um  direction you wanna go in  but at this point in the  in the first meeting it can be any ideas that we just throw out there. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And the key issue here is  is being trendy and original. Um  that does not necessarily mean it needs to be outrageous. Right. Okay we have five minutes left. So  just to cover We have one more thing. Um  like you can go over your ideas  of course  in your own personal times. Um  our next meeting will be in half an hour. So you have half an hour to  uh  think about what you want to present. Or not present but bring to the meeting. Um  I_D_  whatever that stands for. Industrial Designer. I have to remember these things. Um. You'll be beginning your  your working design. Um  U_I_D_ the technical functions design will  will be worked on the next thirty minutes. Um  maybe how this can be achieved  and  um  we need the user requirements from the manag Marketing Expert. Um  you will get specific instructions  um  of what to do in the next half an hour. And I'll see you in half an hour  okay? 'Kay. ,The project manager goes through the minutes of the last meeting. They have the prototype presentation and talk about the final design  features  and power source  type of chip and weight of the remote. They go through the evaulations  using the a list of criteria made by the marketing expert. They rate each criteria on a scale of 0 (true) to 7 (false): how fancy it is  how handy it is  how functional  how cool it is  whether they would spend twenty five euro for it  and whether they would change their current remote for this one. Next they do a cost estimate for production. In doing this  they decide against solar cells and go with the rechargable batteries. They keep the regular chip  stick with plastic  put two scroll wheels and three push buttons  and make it a special shade of yellow. They eliminate the turbo button and give the remote a single curve because of budget restrictions. They briefly evaulate the project process and close the meeting. 
Wouldn't wanna be Project Manager. Uh  what we going to do. Um  once again I'm uh gonna take minutes. So  um no presentation for me. Uh  first we have a prototype presentation by G_ and G_. Afterwards some uh eval eval evalu evaluation s sorry. Uh evaluation crit criteria. Uh  in combination with the finance I um uh I received uh a an uh an Excel uh file which we have to fill in later on. Um  you see. Uh  and then we must see uh if we uh stay under the twelve and a half Euro. So  that's uh that's a big l so let's uh wait it uh um we have we have must uh  we must have uh some time for that uh because it will be uh yeah  quite a lot of mathematics. And after that  uh uh an evaluation of uh the process how we uh how we have done it here with the SMARTboard  with the with our laptops  with the all uh all this. And uh afterwards  uh we closing. Once again  forty minutes  so uh let's start. I would g give the word to um G_ and G_ for the prototype presentation. J_ and J_. Mm. No  okay. It's called a weemote Weemote. Yeah  I can imagine that. Yeah  but uh you d you mustn't forget that uh our target aim is younger people. Uh  we had decided to uh put uh some flashy fruity colours in it  uh and uh in the survey from uh Milan and Paris uh it uh it came out that uh uh the d the older people are uh more willing to uh to spend money on extra features. So I think uh it will be a better idea to have some uh flashy fruity colours as as a standard  and for the people who uh really want uh a more sophisticated  more traditional look  they're willing to pay uh that. They want uh they want more luxury stuff  but they have the money to do it and they want to b to buy that. So  maybe it's an idea to put that as an extra and not as a standard. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But  the mai I think th uh the standard must be some kind of uh uh attractive flashy colours. Not too  but w a little  because that's our aim. Yeah. Well  the buttons don't have to be uh all uh all of yeah. It Yeah. Okay. Thank you. The Marketing Expert. Sorry. Okay  so we gon we gonna evaluate the Yeah  the the thing we saw. Okay  just saw. Yeah. Seven? Uh  true. Sorry. Yeah  one I think. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yes. No teletext buttons. Teletext is in the menu. Volume is true. Yeah  big and clear. Oh  okay. Well  I agree. I was thinking very black and white. Thank you J_. Fruity. Yeah. Well  we p we can do it glow in the dark. So  if it's in the dark place  you still see it glowing. I think Ah  you must see it as uh  w uh according to uh the the other uh remote controls  there may uh uh be there in your uh T_V_ room  this one will stand out  I think. Exa I think that that's what it's about. If it if this lying on your couch  you're you're you think what's that for kinda orange uh thing. So Yeah. Okay. That's our remote control. True. Yeah  but not too soft we have decided. Three  yeah. Easy to use. One. Yeah  can it be zero? Yeah. Okay  two. Yeah  two. What's the time? We also have uh to do the evaluation  uh the production costs and uh stuff. Yeah. You're agree  Tim? You haven't seen a more innovative uh thing in uh Paris? False. Yeah  but they are built in  so it's one. Okay. Freak. Okay  thank you. We'll see. Mm. Okay  we have now to c uh to calculate the production cost. If it's under uh twelve and half Euro  then it's uh ok uh okay. But i is it if it is b Huh? No  this isn't right. Okay so . Redesign. Oh yeah  if they under Yeah. No. Oh yeah. Yeah  it's sorry. Yeah  if the costs are under twelve and a half Euro  uh then we uh can uh ra uh move on to the project evaluation  as we have uh experienced it. Otherwise  we have uh do uh have to do a little uh redesign uh thingy. So Uh  we have to fill in the numbers of the component uh components. We have to uh fil uh  want to uh do it in and uh see uh if we stay under the twelve and a half Euro. So  do we have uh a hand dynamo? No. That's zero. Battery  one? Okay. Kinetic  one? Okay  solar cells  zero. Okay  uh simple chip on print? No? No  advanced chip. Sample sensor sample speaker? Three? Yeah uh  but it it's one one thing  it's three Euro. Uh  what's the sample sensor? Okay. Zero. Uh  uncurved flat. No. But is it s it's not made from a single uncurved thingy and then uh and then uh no? Okay. So it's only uh once double-curved. Okay. We're now in a problem  'cause uh we have uh reached eleven Euro yet. Okay  but uh we have Okay. Uh  rubber. You. Titanium  no? Special colour? Yeah  but we want to make uh the wood colours  uh that uh Yeah  one. Yeah  but we we going to yeah yeah  that's true. But yeah  it's it's it Okay  the push-button  no. Scroll-wheel  no. No. Oh  no. Yes  one. Uh  button  no. No  the the we don't have a s no. Okay. Oh  okay. So  um what's the thing we can change? Uh  can I uh I say something? No  can I say something uh as Project Manager? The kinetic thing  can we just skip it  because uh you have to shake it  but that's not really innovative. Yeah. Yo. Sorry  yeah  yes. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah  and not really. But we if you forget about the kinetic  well if we do that  we shall. So um Uh  b but i but the single-curved is just oh Oh  okay  okay. So that's wh tha that's one option. And then w yeah  and then we could have it  but uh it's its' well it's it's r it is the main point of the the the the look. No  tho uh that that can be done. So uh  okay  a little less uh conversation. Sorry? Fill in Just a explanation. I can delete it for you if you want. So  if we do this  uh we're on uh twelve and a half Euro. And we're done. Uh well  the only uh thing that don't Yeah  single-curved  but there's a curve in it. So Yeah  it's really a static value. Yeah. Yeah  it is. Oh. Yeah  okay. Yeah. Do you think? Well  now you can shake your remote control. Kinetic. Yeah? Who because if you want to go to kinetic  you're uh you're on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat  and I think now it's it's more of uh a compromise thing. And if you make the single curve ha just a big curve  then it's uh then it's uh yeah  one big good curve. I was going to uh say nasty words  but I don't. This is strange by the way. Wood is m is is is cheaper than rubber. We thought that wood would be more expensive. Yeah  maybe. But uh that this is this is it? Yeah. Okay  this is it. I'm gonna save it. Yeah. Okay  well  considering we have Well  we were above  so we did a little redesign Okay  um now uh it's about time to uh talk about uh this project. Uh  some uh things. Were there uh room for uh was there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  yeah  yeah. That's true. I agree with that. Yeah. That's true. Yeah. Yeah  that's true. Yeah. Okay. Uh how about the leadership? Okay  thank you very much. Now we're done. Yeah  that's true. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I notice it too. I was a I was also very uh unhappy  uh very unsatisfied uh about the about the first meeting. So  uh I hope uh uh the the the other meetings uh get better and uh I think the the last two meetings uh also we we reached uh some good decisions about uh talk yeah. Okay  so uh that's cool. Uh  teamwork? Well  maybe that's uh only Yeah well  it's for us  because uh Yeah. Yeah and it's wo more like presentation and some points were discussed. But  really teamwork were you two uh The Yeah? No hard feelings. Yeah. Now you you must push a little while. Okay. O Just uh okay. You can be you can go quicker  'cause then it it won't notice it. I follow the Master class for the SMARTboard  so I think that's the that's the main issue. Um  so uh about this one you were uh you're dealing with  um the the the the digital pen. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. No. Huh. Well Yeah. M yeah. Yeah. And it is still your own handwriting uh popping up in uh Word. No  uh that's true. No. And uh the SMARTboard is uh useful  but the the pen is I uh not user-friendly  I think. Be it it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things  and that's the Yeah  but that's not th the the you when you at a foreign audience  you b don't gonna wr uh write uh small. Yeah. But maybe there's some function with no  it isn't. With uh Yeah. Well  I'm gonna erase my uh name. Yeah  it's a big uh big eraser. Um Well  the the idea of the touch-screen is uh I'm just uh I don't know what what I mean. No. Oh. Oh yeah. That's interesting. Okay  because what does it mean? All the mo yeah  are between one and two. Yeah. Oh  okay. Yeah  okay. Thank you  expert. But the new ideas found for uh wi with working with this uh software? Not really  yeah? Yeah  I think Yeah. Yeah. You had expected it to to be uh more more uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep  yep. Yeah  that's true. Yeah  and and maybe some uh functions for uh uh uh circle or uh a square. You have to draw it yourself now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  that that can be done already. But not the the the the predefined uh squares I think uh Hmm? Sorry? Well  that's nice. Is it Here. oh. Oh  sorry. Select. Yeah. Here  that. So you have as you saw  you have a little uh Oh  you can Yeah  thank you. You can go uh there. So there the the the functionality is there  but it's not it's not ideal  and it's it's very it costs a lot of time to uh to use. And that's a pity  if you uh if you have uh thirty  forty minutes uh for this kind of things  and we are now with four people  but it well  imagine you are here you're with the ten people and everyone uh Yeah. Two minutes of drawing  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah. Yeah  just like he said with the with the a screen which you can write  also uh a kind of voting uh mechanism. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay  so Uh well  just about  because uh Yeah  tomorrow? Uh  the costs are within the budget. Uh  the project is evaluated. But  before we going to celebrate  uh I have uh a little question which you can't answer  because uh there must be some kind of end report. I am busy with the end report right now. You might thinking what the hell was he doing uh Uh about all the meetings  what we have decided  a r r a report of this day. Uh  that must be made  but I don't know  here is uh standing uh whoa  we can celebrate now  but the end report is Okay well  that uh that can be done. Maybe we can do it uh together. You can see what I've uh yeah? So I I s I will uh put it on a story-board. You can see it. Because I think it will uh it must be uh Yeah  it's a three uh with seventy five uh Yeah  just about. Well  just a moment. End report. No no no  I'm just uh you can s you can read it and uh here here it is. End report. Well  this not nit it read-only. But it's not uh fully finished yet. Um  this is about the functional design  the things yeah yeah. Oh yeah. I'm uh when I said it  I remember I had it here. Marketing Expert  okay. Um about the three functions where uh which are most used and uh which must uh immediately be visible on our uh remote control. Um  it must be uh simple to use  very clear what to do  and at the younger people. So  this is really about wh uh what kind things uh must be in it and uh yeah. Yeah  I understand you  I can talk a little bit Dutch. Oka okay  okay  I I really didn't knew that. So  this one's first. You go there and you go there. So  okay. Well  maybe I can then do it one two three. If the order is in uh is is uh important  that's the word for. Uh  then the conceptual design. Uh  well all the things we have uh discussed  uh the energy  which uh turn out to be uh batteries  so that's Yeah  because yeah. Uh  he here it is still double-curve  the rubber  the flashy  the fruity  the removable. Uh  the buttons Hmm? Not double anymore. Nay but that this is what um Yeah. And the the added functions like Tetris snake  it's under the parental control  the touch-screen. So  it's uh just a summary of what uh we had discussed uh Uh  it's very cheap  you you maybe you you you you come at uh It's very necessary. Yeah  but it still has some yeah. Okay  but so we can discuss that uh we can discuss that kind of things I think with the with the the board of uh What's it what's the company called? I just keep forgetting it. Real Real Reaction. Real Reaction  yeah. Okay  so uh anybody uh misses something here about uh Yeah  okay  that's that's what I'm gonna write b between now. But  i in here nothing uh Mm-hmm. Yes. Yeah  touch-screen I've mentioned. Yeah  okay  well I gonna redesign uh something now. No. Because I think it will Oh  five minutes from to finish meeting. Oh  that's cool  Tim. Finish meeting now. Well  I'm I'm I'm going to finish my end report. I am the one who can say that. Yeah? Hereby the meeting is finished. Yeah. J_ and J_. Evaluation. Hmm. Hmm. Interesting. Ah  okay. Cool. J_ and J_. Jane and Jane. 'Kay guys  take it away. Hmm. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Hmm. 'S l it's like an uh Easter egg. Weemote. Wait what I w got in mind. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Maybe it's an idea to sell it without a cover  so that you can pick a cover in the in the shop. Yeah  okay. Yeah  okay. Hmm. Mm. Oui okay. Yeah. An another idea. Uh  maybe we could uh develop a cover uh with wood style. They'll please the elder users as well. Yes. Not not too uh yeah. Yeah  exactly. Yeah. Or blue or. Well I I I think so. Yeah  except for the buttons it's it could be a standard model. 'Kay  it's my time now. Okay. During the Oh. During the design uh design life-cycle we uh we made lot of requirements and trend analysis and stuff. Um  now is the time to uh evaluate our prototype concept to uh to the past requirements. So we are going to evaluate the design according to the past user requirements and trends analysis. Um  we're going to do that with a seven point scale. Opening a Word document now. Okay. One oh  okay  uh I have to expla explain something. We have to uh be consensive about about things. So  it has to be a group uh group decision. Okay? Uh We're going to vote. We yeah? The prototype. Yeah. Okay  one. The remote control is designed for people with age below forty. Seven is false. Yeah  b one or Most true? Yeah  so so a o one is appropriate? Or  more like a four. Three. Ah  exactly. Exactly. Three. Yeah. But also for yeah  okay. Uh  second. The remote control is beautiful. Yeah  acco according to us  it's one? Or Yeah  p s Of c of course you have to be uh very positive and uh enthusiastic about your own product. Three. Uh  the remote control looks fancy. One? Good. Four. The remote control has big  clear channel switching buttons. Daniel. Uh  teletext buttons and volume buttons? False? And volume? True. Big and clear? Hey. Hey. Hide. It's it's not yeah  it J Five? Okay. Yeah  it's it's yeah. Red. Okay. Volume. The remote control is easy to be found. Oh  okay  but 'kay  look. If you put uh your normal uh remote control under your bed  or you throw this remote control under your bed  is it better findable? A li little bit maybe? Four? Fi I Ah  I I I think five. It's it's it doesn't really make a lot of Four? Yes  but five is between four and six. B_. Yeah  it it's Yeah  yeah. But but the survey under users was that they uh really lost it. Like  no not uh not seeing it  but lost it in the house or something. But  okay. Yeah  okay. Yeah  I I agree  I agree. Okay. Eight  the remote control has fresh  fruity colours. Yeah  yeah  not too flashy. The remote control is made of soft material. Three? Easy to use? Top easy to use? It's it's not the most easy to use It can be easier. Jus just with ten buttons  that's the easiest. Yeah  but the most uh easy to use is just with one button on t Yeah  okay  but easy n not not the most easy to use  I think. Two? We also have to compare it to the uh to the remote controls on the market nowadays. So Yeah yeah  I'm uh hurrying. Okay  eleven. The remote control is innovative. A very of course. The remote control has m remova removable from Multilux. The remote control  i it has speech recognition. False. The remote control has built-in games? Yeah. And the last  paren parental advisory function. Yes  I do. Save as. Okay  I will uh do the the math. Now it's your turn. No. Advanced chip. Advanced chip is three. Three Euros  yep. Okay  one piece  yeah. No. Speech recognition  I think. No. No. Thingy. Yes  three. Eight. Okay  go on. Just go on. Two. Two. No. S Yeah  but but D but Daniel  tha that's that's another brand. That's another article to sell. That doesn't account for this. Producing this. No. Yeah. Yeah  of course. Yeah. Daniel. Daniel  what do you think about Here. What do you think about uh putting a battery in it  but also selling like uh the covers  a docking station just apart from the from the thing  so that you can uh put uh rechargeable batteries in it and just Yeah  yeah  okay. Just an idea. Yeah. Yeah  of course. Yeah. Yeah  Yeah. Hey  those ar arcs  why are there for? The blue blue uh Okay. No  no no. Yeah. But  wha 'Kay  look  what is the uh If you make it double-curved  it costs one Euro more. But No  but does it have a lot of extra uh fun function more like Yeah. Yeah  uh aesthetic. I mean  uh you make like eleven and a half Euros profit instead of twelve and a half. But I don't know if twelve and a half is uh a fixed uh fixed price. No  we can't go above that. Yeah? Yeah  okay. Then it's okay. Yeah. Yeah  I think so. Yeah. What a what about all the m the environment freaks? Not freaks  the envi No. I I think it's it's It look like this one. Yeah. Yeah. This is it. Ah no  we have to do all those hours again. Go back. One back? Costs on uh No redesign. Yeah. Yeah  okay  yeah. Hmm. I I didn't think so. That there was a lot of room for it. But  that's mainly because uh of the information that was delivered to us. It was just fixed information and get your stuff from there  and I couldn't go on on i on the internet and search my own stuff. Bu Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  that's true. Leadership was uh crappy. Okay. No  leadership was uh Okay  I thought uh the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting. Uh  you could have but uh  it was your first  no uh no disrespect or something  but you could have uh structure it a l little bit more. So like  I I was talking most of the time the first meeting meeting  and Yeah. But About me. Yeah  you made up. No  it you did better. Yeah. Much more constructive. Two guys. Okay. Means. Digital pen  I thought uh th the first time I did individual work  I used it. But  a and the first two meetings I brought it with me  but I didn't use it at all after the first the first meeting. It's it's not real real use for me. Not really  no. Yeah  like when you do this. Smaller? Oh. Sorry. Okay. New ideas? Do you? Go on. Yeah. Mm  yeah  I think so. Did you heard what he said? I don't I don't know what I mean. Oh  I have some figure. Here. The eva the evaluation  the mm the mean uh number is uh one point eight one point eight six. So that's fairly uh fairly good  I think. Uh  that uh all the requirements uh are true or very true  right. Yep. Yeah. May maybe the idea you proposed is uh a screen here. And draw it  and it's it's placed over there. Hmm? No. Ah  very bad. But I think this is better than regular flip-overs  but Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  but insert image isn't available? Here. Picture from scanner  clip-art. Hyperlink? Hey  what if you do like hyperlink? Type type it? Re Real Reaction dot N_L_. Yes  is now is okay. Okay? Huh. 'Kay  double-click it. You're erasing. Double-click it. Yeah. Yep. What I really miss also is uh is a d is a turtle is a decision uh decision system like um With the evaluation  you have to Polls like  what do you want  a one  a two  maybe a a l a little application like uh uh give your own number and click one two three four five six seven. Yeah  j ju ju yeah  v voting application. Just a little group group decision application. Yeah. Yeah  okay. Yeah  of course. But  uh you can still discuss about it  but but click it in an application  that's a lot easier to process. The digit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. That's it? Celebration. Yeah. Yeah. What is an end report? Yeah. Yeah  yeah. Oh  you ha you have ten minutes left  I uh read. You have now ten minutes left to finish up the end report. Yeah. Um You you already made a beta version  or Pages. Okay  Daniel. Do you want a chair maybe? Hey? Oh  okay. Five minutes for finishing. Management Expert  you have to change that. Marketing. Yeah  but you can save it u the under another name. Maybe um the The Yeah. You Yeah. No  you have to put uh  switch channels uh at the top  because that's the most used function and teletext at the second Oh nay  a volume changing  second. S switch  yes. Yeah. Okay  go on. Yes  very good. Yeah. Yeah. The order. Single-curves. No  okay. Was initial  the plan. The initial plan. No  it's it's not very cheap  but that no  but it's a development inside corporation. Like  uh w we don't have to buy parental control. Our own people can make that  I think. Yeah  it it has some cost  but Yeah. Real Reaction. Okay. Still the end conclusion. That's all  I think. Yeah  but but the the decisions are put in the uh conclusion  I think. Why we decided to use a flat uh L_C_D_. Yeah. Um Save it. Hmm. Yeah  but then you had the same thing. Example of children remote. Oh wait. Wait. Hmm. That's a pity. You declare. Evaluation. Mm-hmm. That's gonna be t problem. Yeah  well sure. Hi. Yeah  uh well  and as you saw  we would just have the basic remote with the panel L_C_D_ uh screen. Well  these would be the main buttons  h you could uh change them later on in your own profile if you want to. But  well it's standard they will be delivered with this kind of uh set-up. We have the more advanced menu uh setting right here. We have the sub-menus and stu stuff. We made a top oh  or a front view. Just so like you wanna uh back view. As you can see  this uh there  there are uh two uh weird bumps in it. This is for uh the added uh effect of uh well uh y youth and dynamic. And uh this is for the artistic effect. Well  what we figured is uh we'll show you a picture later on you have more b a better idea after that. But  idea is for to stay in balance with these two uh with these two. And so when you put it on the table  it will just lay down. It won't uh roll around or stuff. But it will lie more in your hand like an old telephone maybe  or like these old uh phones. Y you you may get the idea. So thi this is about uh how we figured it should be. The s panel we g you would hide with some more uh rubber layers  like we discussed early on. Uh  you would s you wouldn't see the uh straight panel  but more fluidly and round. Yeah. And uh  in these bumps you could actually uh put some electronics uh that would you can make a more thinner uh design  and that would actually look very nice  yeah. And uh  about the colour  what have Yeah  f uh  as colours  do you do you have the picture in uh Oh yeah. Now  well this is the idea about uh the bumps. Uh  you can see there's a v a very uh youthful uh dynamic uh exterior. It uh you just want to hold it you uh you are young and uh dynamic like us. Yeah  it's like an e but this is for children. We we want a more adult version. But  this is like a remote control for children.. A weemote. Yeah. Hey  that's actually a brilliant uh marketing stand. Uh  but So this actually basic the idea. We we just want to build a more uh adult vers adult version of of this. And and for colours  we we figured starting with basic colours like uh white or metallic grey. Those are the technological colours actually  so it d Or blue or whatever. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  maybe yeah  perhaps you're right. Uh  I I would I would actually agree with this sounds logical. Nah. Yeah. Yeah  li like like this like this. This isn't this isn't too much  is it? I f Yeah. The buttons  I Yeah  uh something like this would be nice. Okay  that's that's it from us. Uh-oh. Why? Yeah  it's not just uh designed for people under the age of forty. It's also designed for people above forty. So I have I've Yeah  two or three  because it's not just uh the qu question is aimed at is it designed for people with age below forty. But it's also designed for people of age above forty. So  I'll say it's about three. Yeah  I I think Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Leads to user face  yeah. Yeah  false. Uh  hmm. Yeah  the they are big and clear.. Yeah  but but the teletext button. Yeah  you can ch That's in a menu. So  it's w yeah  it it it it isn't entirely unclear  but So  I wouldn't give it a seven. I would give it a more a five or a six. Uh  I don I don't know. What do you think  uh Mister Project Manager? Hmm. Yeah. Yeah  it has these all these fruity colours and it has a strange shape. So  if you so if you have trouble finding it Well  then uh then I'll go for four. Because uh four is between three and uh uh also between between true and false. Uh  so I'll I'll go for four. Wha Yeah  that that's a better question actually. Well  if i if you see a strange shape lying somewhere  uh then you'd uh recognise it as  whoa  that is strange. Yeah. Yeah  what is that. Uh  so it's Yeah. Yeah  rubber  is kind of soft. Well  I don yeah  it is kind of It No. Uh It could yeah. Functional ability.. No  it's it I I'll go for two. My vote's on two. Yes. Yes  it Yeah  they are built in. Not down. You really like the parental advisory. Bu Yeah  he made it. No. Me  too. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh  n no. No. Yes. No. Uh  we have one. We have one. No  sev zero. Well  that's um yeah  speech recognition and s A zero. No. No. Yeah. Just go on. Then we'll see uh we'll we'll see uh wha how much we are over budget. Zero. I don't think so. No  this is a standard colour. Yes  this is a special colour. That's an add-on. No. These three. Well  we're only four Euro over budget. But Well  other case  we can make it single-curved or uncurved. Yeah. Okay  sure. Yeah  sure. Okay  well you you can go from double-curved to single-curved. And that would solve the budget problem. Yeah. It's just yeah well  the single-curve that Yeah. Exactly  yeah. We going to cut Yeah  we just make it flat. But  you do l Function. Worth  does it have added worth? No  um Yeah  well let's assume it is. We we should assume it i that it is. But I I figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion. R if you uh promote a kinetic um I kinetic remote control  I mean  that would b sell better than an a normal remote control. No  well  y I mean uh  y you can go into your neighbour and tell him  ha  my k uh remote control is kinetic. You have standard old battery control uh remote con True. It is possible  but you can't use double uh curves for titanium. That's one of the functionability uh Well  I th I think you two  uh especially you and uh and uh Daniel  you d you you both had uh the less creative uh roles in the project. 'Cause I think m I think Jeroen and I  we had a more design we could have more we had more room for creativity than than you two. Ha. Nah  the leadership wasn't crappy  it was the leader that was crappy. Nah. No  the leadership was okay. Yeah  it was good. Try to learn from your mistake. And we will never do it again. Yeah  that went w it went well. It's it's just uh Nah. Yeah  we we had some trouble with the pen  but Yeah  but us Yeah. Oh. No  I have it working. But  uh yeah  well uh No  it doesn't have that much added value to the Yeah. Know what I mean. Or text function. Just t t type text  and that that would be uh excellent. Mean Oh. But uh  problem is  well you can't discuss anything well you you ca uh you can  but you will discuss a lot less than l like we did now. We I mean uh w w w one one person s maybe said three. But  well uh I we said uh  no I w th think two  because this and this  and then you can react uh on it. But if you you put a three on it  uh just figure well  everybody knows what I'm knowing  so they'll all just put a two on. Yeah  but it would yeah. Yeah okay  the for processing part. But then uh  I think the idea of one person entering it and the rest uh discussing it  that uh isn't that bad idea  actually. Not that your opinion isn't valued  but but still. Yeah  sure. Y yikes. Seventy five pages. So you you finished it actually  and so we just have to read it and say yes or no? It's not double. Uh  it's not double anymore  eh? Yeah  okay. Yeah. On thing uh One small thing uh  the added functions. Uh  was it included in the cost? I don't think so  eh? It's very cheap. Okay  um hereby is the meeting is finished. Yo. Evaluation criteria. Oops. Some creative uh Oh. Yeah. Ok okay. Shall I give a short introduction and then uh Okay. J_ and J_  okay. Take it away. Um  this was our first concept. We decided to use a single touch-screen. So  we've worked out this concepts  how to how to hold it  where to put the buttons and and stuff. And um  well  we began with uh with a form of shape  that is uh is easy to hold w in one hand  left or right handed. So  we made i it a little bit less thick and uh it has some ar artistic meaning. No? This uh isn't nothing. Idea maybe uh is better. Um well  during the meeting I showed you the concept of uh placing the buttons on top  usable with your thumb  and uh the menu structure  uh if necessary  with your other hand  so it's just gonna hold it easily. And it has to be acce accessible with your uh other hand too  of course. So we began uh working out a concept. Yeah  the panel just uh of course goes like this. But the overlaying layer is uh a little bit uh curved and stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Oh  we added that this um can be held with your hands for this maximum is om yeah  one and a half centimetres. So  you have room here for your battery and maybe even other um electronic chips. S and you can just be the the layer of the touchscreen and some have some wires underneath it to make it as uh thin as possible in the middle for good grip. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It would be best to to appeal to a broad public and make the covers exchangeable  so the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple  but when the o older people uh go in the shop and they see uh an orange um remote control  it would be less appealing than a white one. And young people  we think  are a little bit more flexible  they think  ah I'll buy for a couple of Euros some noi nice hip uh Well  um I think a cover is necessary  'cause als otherwise you'll just have the L_C_D_ screen. So  there must be some cheap standard cover  um maybe white or something  that's could comes with it and you can buy  so we can make extra money. Okay. The other way around  you mean. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay  yeah. Well yeah  a colour of a wood style  a white c and uh a couple of h hip uh fruity colours. And lea uh l delivered standard with a fruity colour  but not too not too much. This is banana and mango  not not purple or p orange and yellow. Ah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah  okay. No. Yeah. Okay. Okay. It's my turn. Mm. Yeah. No no  a little more in the middle. No  uh three or yeah. Yeah  it will be primary appealing to to m minus forty  but also appealing to Yeah. It's Wow. Yeah  it's the marketing uh angle on television. We have a wonderful Yeah. Well  it's also fancy then. Yeah. Of course. We have a perfect remote. Yes. Yeah yeah  oh they have to agree but I'm the User Interface uh Expert. Um  uh no. You you've different menu. And volume is impo yeah. Yeah yeah  big and clear. But you could make a teletext button uh six. Otherwise  the people who read this uh are gonna think we have no teletext button. No. Yeah. Black and red. Okay  don't forget to save it. Uh Uh well  when we put in fancy colours  yeah and Yeah. But  um it it's not making any sound uh  have we deciding? So It'll make a difference. We have the better re I don't know. Yeah  I think so. My remote control's black. A little bit  but yeah. Uh K yeah. Fo fo yeah fo five is. Yeah  okay  you're right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If your uh fifteen remotes in a drawer  uh you find it  yeah? Yeah  that's stupid. Uh  but when you lost it you're just not Yeah  mostly when you lose your remote control  it it's under your Most of times when you lose it you're sitting on it. Uh Um I would call uh choose two  'cause we decided not to make two f uh fresh colours  as it would not. Um  kinda soft  but but not this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah  easy to use  very afford. No  you can do two  because um it can be easier. But then you're l yeah  but then you'll lose function f yeah  functionality and our fancy uh look  so. But It is r it is rather easy to use  because you have the primary buttons always visible. No. Yeah  m mine too. Yeah  but waits just a minutes. Inspiration. These are the m regular remotes. Yes  true  one. Yes  one. Very multifunctional. No. This is used with speech recognition  this. Yes. But uh  maybe make it two  because the games are in a sub-menu and not uh it's not an entire game. Yeah  okay. Yes. Th did you make this or the Yeah  It changes it maybe. Oh yay. Oh dear. Hmm? If they're under twelve fifty. Yeah? Cau 'cause so it's okay. Battery  yes. One. One  yeah. Kinetic  one. Yeah. No. No  the advanced chip is uh Yeah. Yeah  you give it a sample  uh one. No. You no. Yeah  'cause um the layer around it fits around the bubbles on the o on the uh the back of the Uh  we don't have anything else. So Could you step a little to the right ma Yeah. Oh  sorry. Or And zero. Special uh is the special colour? Mm. Yeah. Yeah  if if you're honest  we'll uh type one  special colour. Yeah. Uh  j maybe we'll finish uh the the list first and then look back  aye? No. Scroll wheel  no. No. One  yeah. No. Mm  is it No. No. So No. No. Mm  single-curves. Yeah. Just cut off the kine yeah. Or yeah. Yeah  we just put a good battery it it. Mobile phones nowadays. But you can use rechargeable batteries anyway  just you s you have to recharge them manual. Yeah  that's a cost reduc Ah. Yeah  so we have to bake the ba back flat  and then No  it's it's just one curve and not a back uh curved I think. Or Or are these two curves? Uh Yeah  but what else uh do we have to cut out? No advanced chip  uh that's a little bit of problem. Although  can we make it with a regular chip? Curvy. Explanation. Twelve fifty. Well Yeah  but does it fit with our design? Do we have to u adapt it? It's single-curves. W Could we just make the bubbles uh cut off the back  and then we're uh has Okay. More. Yeah. You make it optional. Functional. Uh  there's an a a athe aesthetic value  but not functionality. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  but it doesn't fit in our co cost profile. So You ma can make an an especialised extra gold version. Yeah. Yeah  just one big curve. Uh  this uh American figures. You just cut down some trees. Whoever makes uh a remote control out of titanium. Yes. No. We sue. We Yeah  we'll start her all o all over again. Um For us  there was a lot of creativity. We could just sign up an uh remote if we liked. Uh Crappy. Cra Yeah. Yeah  example of crappy leadershi Okay  yeah. You could of said  shut up you fool. Yeah  more more consensus. Ev everybody w was agreeing every Yeah. Well  we work together on a project  but everybody has his own task. So  it is a little bit Yeah. No Well  it went okay. Stupid stupid pen  but uh Yeah  but but draw something uh difficult. D uh just write your name right now. Try to write your name  in in writing letters  of course  yeah? Yeah  normally  uh this uh the w Block letter sign it  yeah? Just just write your name in in one line. If it's a little bit too small bit quicker now. It didn't Uh he he knows how it works  yeah. Y well  yeah. Th the i The idea is great  but it doesn't work properly. Uh Yeah. Nee. As uh as I said a m a c few moments ago  it I would like  myself  to write with a normal pen  because must um Yeah  it's almost the same concept  but you can just sim more simply put it on our scanner. I it's the same concept as the pen  where you f have to download the software or s uh very uh slow. Yes. No  and it doesn't give any added value. Yeah  not user-friendly. Yeah  and it's it's not very precise. We're trying to m to Yeah  it may um Yeah  and tr try to wri write your name uh in a in a normal uh size  yeah. Smaller. Yeah  smaller. Just like when you're writing on a letter. No  a as you saw on on this drawing  just open open this one or that one. It's uh th it it Yeah  uh we had more problems even here when we trying to draw these buttons  it's almost impossible to get clear uh when you're uh And the eraser was another problem. It w t is is this large. And when you try to erase this line  y I'm gonna erase my name there. M Abo What kind of new ideas? Yeah  uh New ideas about uh the working of this software  about about the project  about the remote controls or Hello. Yeah. So true. Not really  just they have to improve it. Uh  the concept is okay  but it has to be quicker. Uh  it is still opening my programme  n almo almost uh my entire computer is locked up during the process and it  yeah  just takes too many time. People will still feel the need to to write it quickly on uh a page and not download it and save it  and More user-friendly. 'Cause when you use a pen  you can just draw like you d draw normally  and you do Yeah. Yeah  that l Would be easier. Or at least when you you don't have to adapt to the technology  just you can write in the way you normally write. And now you have to um keep constantly in mind that you're drawing on this screen. And that's a very bad concept. Nah  okay  I I it's my opinion that I Yeah  it's can be saved easier. But if you're in normal flip-over you a lot of people write text. There's no text option. And writing text uh  yeah  you've gotta really do your best to write some Yeah. Or maybe even insert picture. If you have uh some presentation  and you have some f Yeah. 'Cause then you could Oh  okay. So you can With uh W_W_ dot Google dot com. Oh yeah. Maybe. You'll just make a link in Yeah. There's one way to uh Maybe if if you're not using the eraser Something else th Yeah  arrow. Okay. Well  it's Yeah  okay. But. To use  yeah. Yeah. And that's m That's mostly the case  from the over here with the managements you get two minutes to make your case  and if you have to do all this kind You'll rather use PowerPoint and work it out in advance. And th the one or two things you have to draw when you're there  just use a flip-board. Yeah. Okay. Yo  manager. When are w When are we going to produce it? Oh. A chairman. Yes. It's a read-only version. Oh  okay. Uh One two three. Yeah. Well  okay  maybe you can add it later that we decided in the end because of the cost. A single-curved. Ah  it's very cheap. Yeah. He'll do it in his free time. So uh Of directur or directors. Yeah. You can ask your personal Yeah  the end conclusion. But uh Um  the decision to make um the buttons on the top  and the menu on the on the bottom. And clearly Yeah  touch-screen you've mentioned. Okay. Okay  this n yeah. Party party. Oh  before you change anything maybe you um save it first. You can't you can select file and export and then those J_ PEG files. Well  eight. And we have uh  another blank one. Did we change anything? Wow. Yeah. It's a new uh commercial logo. Don't save it  aye? Uh  why are only the first five SMARTboard files saved? ,In the detailed design meeting the team created a prototype. Along with buttons for numbers  channel selector  volume  mute  on-off  teletext  and subtitles  the prototype included an LCD screen and a help button for functional information. One rechargable battery  single-curve form and plastic case  brought the total cost to 17 Euros. To reduce this cost  it was decided to replace most buttons with a scrollwheel. The remaining buttons were one for channel selection  one for volume (both assisted by the scrollwheel)  teletext  on-off and the help button. A suggestion to target the product to a younger or perhaps more general group was met with approval. All these components were re-arranged in a revised prototype. It was evaluated on a scale from 1 to 7 on the basis of the following criteria: fancy design (6)  technological innovation (4)  functionality (7)  consideration of the target group (3). The remote was also recognisable as a fashionable Real Reaction product. The project process was deemed well-structured  although everyone thought it would have been better had they known the component prices at an earlier stage. Teamword and leadership were good  but room for creativity impeded by budget constraints. 
Okay um  welcome to our detailed design meeting. I'm pretty excited. Let's start it's approximately fifteen forty or something like that. Okay um the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then um I'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting  what we d discussed um  then we'll have the prototype presentation and a look at the evaluation criteria. We'll look at the finances and finally a do a production evaluation and close. So  starting off with the um last the last one  oh I don't have it here um  but we talked about energy  we're gonna use a kinetic battery um  we want to use a simple chip  because we're not gonna need a a shuffle um  we're gonna need a scroll um  we're choosing a latex case w in fruity colours that's curved and um we're using push buttons uh with a supplement of an on-screen menu. And it sounded like we had set um like eight or nine buttons  including five pre-set channels. Okay? Let's do the look and feel design presentation first. like a little lightning in it. The little lightning bolt in it  very cute. The v the rhombus rhombus? Um on  off? Okay. Yeah we turn it off. Mm-hmm. Okay. Uh-huh. Very interesting. I think that one's my favourite. Mm-hmm. Mm 'kay. Now that was one thing that we brought up over email. I don't know if you picked up your email  but um the f the um feature that we considered for it not getting lost. Mm-hmm. It's really Would it be very difficult to um just have an external device that like I dunno  you tape to your to your T_V_ um that when you press it you ha a little light beep goes off? Do you think that would be conceptually possible? Mm-hmm. Mm. That's true  mm 'kay. Mm-hmm. Okay  that's a fair evaluation. Getting lost. Um we so we do we've decided not to worry about that for now. Okay 'cause well  the designs are very bright  so you're right  they're gonna stick out  but um Mm-hmm. Could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off? So then w we wouldn't have to have like a dual function? Sure. Um uh why don't we do a product evaluation using your criteria  if you've developed some? Oh okay. Okay. Okay. Do you need this or just write on the white board? Okay. It's kind of like uh like a joystick kind of thing  you know  kinda push it. 'Kay. Maybe a little smaller than that. Oh it does  it's kind of like There it could have a stem like that  'cause I do l kind of like the stem. Yeah. It almost helps you ge keep a grip too  'cause it goes in between fingers. I like this one. Variety of colours are nice. I think I'm leaning towards the potato. Mm-hmm. I am worried about like um using a menu. Um in that like i withing menus there are submenus  and so how do you get back to the main menu? But that has a menu button separate from a select button  whereas if this one's both the menu and the select button? Okay. Could these be used for going to submenus or Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Well  as long as we have that in mind as we're designing it still  mm 'kay. I think so. I I kind of think it's it's unique enough that I'd give it a one or a two. Okay. I will give it a one. Um functional. I think it'll get everything done  I think it might be a little confusing at first  um  I don't know if that's gonna be a later one. Okay  then I'm gonna give it a two. Did you give a functional? Okay. Well  the kinetic battery. But they'll notice it after like a year  they'll be like hey  I have never changed the battery. Mm. Just the material. Think I'm gonna go with the four as well. I really like that kinetic battery though. Mm 'kay. Uh let's say two. Give it a one. Mm. 'Cause there would be less impact maybe . That's right  yeah  corporate colour  we didn't keep that in um well if we I know it would make it a little less c a little more confusing  but if we had all the buttons in black  and a design in and the outside in yellow  that'd be our corporate one and we could also have alternative colours  one a more conservative one  one that's more fruity. Um and can we have like an R_R_ inscribed on the bottom or something? Okay. Fruity  so fruity. I think i it's kind of mangoey too. Yes. Mm. One. Mm-hmm. Yes. It's gonna be hard. And if it's repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons that you're constantly pushing  but um I like how it fits in the hand though so I I'd go with a two. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. I think I'd give it a four too. It's a pretty high learning curve  it'll be easy once you've done it  but We we I think we can kind of say we addressed it with colour  but Mm-hmm. Mm I'd give it a four. Small too. Three. It's totally fashionable. I'd give it a one. Mango. I do like uh the little Martian one. One. Mm-hmm. I think as long if we offer in a in at least three different colour arrangements. Um yeah  that's good. So I'll give it a a two. Well um we didn't we didn't address the fact that it does need to b have a corporate logo  so let's let's make sure we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an R_R_ on it. All of them should have R_R_  yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm 'kay. Lovely. Okay  now we're gonna look at finances. Um I have an Excel sheet that we're actually gonna calculate the cost um  so let me exit out of this first. Okay um I know. Let me one more space. Gonna zoom in real quick. Okay. Hand dynamo. We're using kinetic battery  right? Um and we're having one per One  okay. Um electronics. Simple. Mm 'kay. Um the case. It's very curvy  so okay. The wood? I mean the rubber. Mm-hmm  okay. Yeah  we're using we're gonna need at least two special colours. Um. I dunno where it yeah. So let's y say three. Yeah  I dunno. That I thi I thought that would be under yours. We'll just say three. Mm-hmm. Maybe the R_R_ will be in colour as well  so yeah. Interface  we're doing push buttons. And how many buttons do we have? Six. Anything else? Oh  buttons oh  so um. So the case material will just have one colour  right  but then the buttons will be in special colours? We're saying per unit. Okay  so each unit will only have one colour on their but the case is could have up to thr I mean the buttons could ea could be up to three colours  'cause that how it's designed there. So Special form? They're all kind of just push button  right? Special material? Uh. Oh do I have to do it per button  do I? Okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Thirteen point seven. Yeah  what can we reduce? Let's see what that would do. It's only gonna bring us down to thirteen point three anyway. Okay um  are we sure this is double-curved? Maybe it's single-curved  we have no idea. Well it's not the yeah. Okay  it's the kinetic battery that's kind of expensive  but we have a simple chip  single curve  case material is rubber and it's a special colour  but that's important. Six buttons we have to have six buttons. What? No  okay  maybe not. I don't know what just happened. Now it's twelve. Twelve point five. So we're okay  I think. Yeah. Okay  we're all set. Um save. I saved that to our um our big shared folder  so you know. Um okay  back to agenda. Um are the are the costs under twelve fifty Euro? Yes. Let's move on to the project evaluation. Project process. Satisfaction with for example the room for creativity  leadership  teamwork  the means  any new ideas found. So I guess what we're gonna talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project  the information we got on the news  how we used it  if we were able to um  you know  use our creativity with the information  um how how well I guess I led it  um the how well we worked together as a team  um the digital pens  the whiteboard. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I think we all made um very significant contributions  I don't think anybody dominated it  which I thought was really good  like each of us was able to um like each of you had your information and I uh I tried to facilitate it without like taking over  um I like our little finished products. Really cute. I know  let's think of it like a little jingle. Um.. Okay um new ideas found? Definitely. Or or at least be c p creative enough to think of toggle switches mm etcetera. Oh  I'm so excited. Mm-hmm. I thi yeah  that's awesome. Um okay  closing. Are the costs within the budget? Is the project evaluated? Now there's the final questionnaire and meeting summary. Um so  this is the great product kids  I think we've created something really interesting and that we have a market for it  um especially if we can produce it at twelve point three which we hope um yeah. Make sure in your questionnaire to put down criticisms of both the process and the um the final results and. I do like the Martian remote. If we could choose more than one  that would be my second choice. Although the tog toggle I'm afraid I would It's cool. I think I would break it. Oh yeah  it's kind of a penguin. Mm-mm. Mm 'kay  congratulations. Um. Anything else to say? Alright. Um anybody have I got more master classes  anybody else wanna like take a master's class? Yeah  but check it out. So like there are all these like links  they don't go anywhere. But all that you need to keep in mind your knowledge management. Um just wanna make sure you do. Oh It is. Yes definitely I'm very sad that I didn't get any links to the corporate website.. Wow. Yes. I love Excel  it's one of my favourite programs. I see  mm. Spongy. I I thought it was a little tricky having to hand around this thing. We had a lot of the um otherwise the technology today was kinda cool. Mm-hmm. No. Although I don't see how we could have very l at least for me I Mm. Mm-hmm. And with and with the PowerPoint that we can all look at  like you can do all those things pretty much on PowerPoint as that's not as necessary to have. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Now when you were um creating your um prototypes here  did you work together or did you like do separate projects? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Cool. Oh thanks. It's kinda fun. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. This is what we'll do. I found that we did we could have used another five or ten minutes sometimes in the meetings. Mm-hmm. Yeah I think the last time we had a lot of information  but at the same time not quite enough  you know what I mean  like we we couldn't answer every single question. Um but Mm. It was interesting what came out like later  like as I was doing the when I was doing the breakdown on the agenda that they gave me um  that more points came out from your presentation even. Um. I'm a little I am a little disappointed that we didn't do a um something for losing the remote  because that was kind of a big point. About yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Considered the re yeah. Well it's interesting that they Mm-hmm  yeah. It was interesting though that they put that fifty percent of people say they have frustration with losing their remote and yet they didn't provide us with information to um we weren't provided with information to discuss that. I know that like people people have like things they can put on their keys that you press it and it'll beep  but I but I'm sure that would require some kind of technology that I just don't know what it is  but Mm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. It d yeah  it depends on how organised you are personally  but Mm-hmm. Oh. Can't get in. Yep. We should make one that walks by itself. Or or like some crazy like electro-magnet  that you push it and it'll go zoom to the T_V_ and stick there. Well  but if you could attach them to the T_V_  then you can. Mm. Okay. Sorry  I'm just um trying to update my minutes. I decided to you know how I sent you the email saying that PowerPoint minutes will be complimentary  rather than like repeating them. Just gonna make I'm making full minutes  so that it'll include all of the agenda and all that. 'Cause that seems a little more useful. But I didn't have like information to sloth through either  so Most of it  mm-hmm. I added slides  um I added a couple slides each time  but that was about it. Mm. Well  the thing was they would provide y an agenda with s like several points  but it wouldn't have a slide for each point. And that's the only way I remember that I need to go other that point. I know personally when I do PowerPoint  that's what I do and so I had it once  even if it was just like the title of it  like the three presentations  and I would do your three. The slogan on it? No no no. I think we just need the um the R_R_  yeah. Yeah  I was just kinda going by the web page  'cause they didn't give me any clear  like yellow  grey  or. I don't really like yellow in general. But it Wasn't it interesting that um I thought it was interesting that our market marketing um expert did not agree with the marketing um the marketing choices  you know  like that was a bit of a conflict. People are stupid. Maybe  like I don't know. That could always be. Oh. I'm claiming it intellectual property. Right  well we made three different prototypes and I guess we'll start with with this one. Um we have our colours not are not fixed  but this is the general shape. Um it's you hold it sort of either like like this in your left hand or you switch it over and uh it's easily adaptable to either hand. You can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone  or you can push them with your index finger of your other hand  or even I mean there's a whole variety  you can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger. Uh we have the on off button at the tip  very visible  very big. We have our up and down buttons  which are also gonna be our channel selectors  and we have our little menu button here. If you push if you're just pushing these normally  they're the menu buttons  if uh the volume buttons rather. If you press select once  they become channel changing buttons. If we press select three times  the menu with the other features and pro possibly also with your T_V_ channel choices shows up  and you have your five presets down here. Um if people wanna grab hold of that  see how it feels in your hand. That's our number one prototype. Um do you wanna present the potato  or shall I present the Martian? That's the rhombus  yep. If you pressed and held it maybe. Yeah. On off  that's a possibility  yeah. And then finally we have um the Martian or the pear  either way. Um it's a bit different  just a little bit more of a creative feel. Uh you have the on off toggle stem on the top. We have the five preset seeds. And then you have on the sides to make it a little bit more three-dimensional  you have your channel changing  volume changing buttons and your menu button right here in the middle. So  that's for your consideration as well  plus it's an interesting talking point to have standing up. We figured it could stand up like this on your table  if you wanted it to  if I made the bot the bottom flat. Uh the menu select button. We were we were thinking that normally we'd go for fruity colours  but maybe we're also thinking that your sort of middle aged man  for an example customer  might not want a fruity coloured remote  so m maybe we'd have one version that's a bit toned down  maybe with with less contrasts on it. Yeah  something still a little bright to make it hard to lose  but yeah. Right. Well we were we were talking about that a little bit when we got that email and we think that each of these are so distinctive  that it it's not just like another piece of technology around your house. It's gonna be somewhere that it can be seen. So we're we're not thinking that it's gonna be as critical to have the loss I think Yeah. There might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip to make it make a noise or something  but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon. So d do people have a preference as far as feel and functionality? Um. Mm yeah  that's good  that's good. Here  stick it on. So where Right. Okay. Ooh. Hey. No  I kinda like it. That's hard to miss. Like Yeah. Interesting. Okay  is that where people are leaning then  the potato? I like the idea of the I mean that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down  that one. Hmm. Well that on the iPod  for example  you just every time you wanna go back you hit the menu button again and it brings you back one level. Good point. Maybe yeah  maybe it can be one of those  if you press down and hold for two seconds  then it brings you back one level or something. The potato? Are we leaning towards the potato? Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Um I dunno if it's it's creative. I dunno if fancy is the word I would use. I dunno if any of them are fancy in I'd say two  because c unique. Yeah  one. In the battery  that's it. How many people would notice that  though? Yeah. I I would say that it's Yeah  like fancy versus creative it's it's different. But does that equal innovative? I dunno. I'll give it a three. Okay. Um I'll give it a one. Pretty hard to mess up. Yeah. Ooh  that you couldn't it'd be harder to break  harder to lose. Mm. It it might be  'cause that's our corporate colour  isn't it? We might wanna keep it yellow. Yeah. If we had a yellow Sure. So it was inspired by the potato  so I think it's pretty fruity. Oh  mango that that That's a much more trendy than a potato one. Yeah  me too. Yeah. Yeah. I'll I'll say two as well. Because older people that aren't used to like texting with the thumb might find it a bit at first  but The menu system and the the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing  but I think if it's one it's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out  but you'll have it afterwards. So I'd I think I'd give it a two I guess. Oh  good point. Um I'd say I'd give it uh a three  I guess it depends on how tidy you are normally. Simple to use or simple in design? Do you know? Right. I'm give it a three I guess. I dunno. I don't think it's quite as fashionable as my robot remote or alien or whatever he was. Um two. Yeah. Yeah  I'll say two. Shall we uh Well I think all of them should have an R_R_. Oh my. Uh we're n using kinetic  yeah. Yeah. Single. Simple  simple rather. Uh uh uh double-curved. Yeah I never did get a picture of those so I don't really know. Our case material supplements oops  we just skipped by them. No  we we the plastic is the plastic for the inside is assumed. The supplement is Oh  I guess it was rubber rather than latex. Yeah. Uh well I don't know what the se the basic colour is though. Well  are we talking about on each colour combination or are we  you know  we'll like we'll have yellow and black. Is that two special colours? Or or is white and black  then two more or Uh. I guess it's three  three three. Alright. Yeah. Six  with the power. Yeah. No. Oh  we'll do we wa Are the buttons in special colour  special f I didn't get information on Well  does it but if we're making multiple varieties of this is where I'm getting confused. per unit  okay  okay. Alright  and each button s Yeah  okay. No  I think they're fine. Material  we want them rubber as well probably  yeah. No  I don't think so. I think they're if they're all gonna be rubber then it that's what it matters. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Oh oh. Okay  let's have our buttons all be one colour. Alright. Uh. We have no idea. I dunno  I didn't get any pictures. It's single curved. Why not? Yeah. That is important. How did it get more expensive  what did you just change? It was it was thirteen and now it's fifteen. Twelve point five. Hey hey. We're all set then. Ish. Alright. Yes. Well. I felt very creative. I enjoyed making the prototypes. Yeah. I think we could've done even better with a little bit more information  like what's a single-curved case  how many colours  what do colours count things  but given given what we had I think that we did we did really well. Um I think we worked together pretty well. Yeah. But the fruits and vegetables  they really my creativity  so. Do you think we could Yeah. Yeah. Can we market this as the mango remote? Should we have that somewhere on the packaging? I have a little R_R_. Yes. Hopefully not with just my fingernail at some point but um it's quite a useful little gadget. All thanks to Iain for the design of that one. Mm. What did we find for new ideas? People should really base their remotes on fruits and vegetables. I I am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now after reading about them. That was I I knew you can get watches that had them  like really quite expensive watches that just never need a battery  'cause you're always moving your wrist. But in other things  I think it'd be really good. Yes. Yeah. It started because I wanted to have it as st as a stem and then alright  so Is it started as a pear  but then it started looking more and more like a Martian when I put the Take me to your leader. Wow  maybe I should market it to some remote control company now. So are are poor little thing. Oh. It's really funny that you got spam in your work emails. Let's see  what did I get through the corporate website? It's just inspiration about circuit boards. Yeah  that is pretty neat. Yeah  my inspiration from from last time is the in interior of a remote control being taken apart bit by bit  talking about circuit boards. I learned a lot actually. I could probably take apart a remote control now if I really needed to. Now I have all about circuits and chips and transponders and I wrote it all down  because I thought it would be relevant  like all the different parts of the inside of a remote control  but then they're like  you don't actually need this you just need to talk about the case. It's really interesting though. Yeah. That was really neat how I got emails and No. I yeah. If I'd gotten pictures of the different parts of the case  the different looks of the case  I would have probably drawn them up  but Yeah  we could've put our brainstorming stuff up there rather than just talking about it  but with only four people it doesn't really make sense. I think if you had a larger group Yeah. Because we're all gonna be working in different places. We if we were all gonna stay in here all the time  then having the notes up on the whiteboard would've been alright  but everyone needs their own  like specific notes  I guess. Yeah. Yeah. So it was a bit of both really  we just kind of started out by each taking a colour of clay and just fooling around with it and I came up with that rhombus shape and he came up with the sort of potatoey  mangoey shape  and then just went from there really. It was fun. So well done with the management  I felt well managed. That happened to me all the time though. Yeah  I was quite worried at the end of the last meeting that we weren't getting we didn't really have enough information to make firm decisions  but we were able to do it regardless  so. I'm not usually a very decisive person  so it helped to have people say this needs to be done in five minutes. Especially last time  yeah. Yeah  Yeah. Yeah. Right. And I I felt the first two meetings  that I was coming in with no information  and not sort of made me really like  ooh I don't know  throwing together PowerPoint out of no no information and then last time it was like the opposite. I had so much information and so much to talk about. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. that was something like in order to talk about that we would've had to have actual knowledge about circuit boards and things like Yeah. I think we were Yeah. I think we were just getting overenthusiastic with the task. I think we really got into it  I mean I got into it as the day went on and I got really like  ooh I'm designing a remote control  I dunno if that's just me  but Yeah. Yeah. I think there are some of those like infomercial remotes that have things so you won't lose them. I dunno. I mean we were talking about it and like i in my household at least  there's only about two places that the remote is ever 'cause there's only one T_V_ and there's only like three chairs. Yeah. Yeah  or like I guess what the setup of the house is too. But  I mean I am notorious for losing my keys  I just I guess I've just never lost the remote. I put my keys in the refrigerator the other night and couldn't find them. 'Cause I was putting groceries away. You you're taking stuff from a bag and putting them in the refrigerator and then go back to my room. Can't get in  look all around the kitchen. Definitely in the vegetable drawer. So. Mm. But I guess it's 'cause we don't carry remotes around that much. Yeah. Maybe with our little robot one we could've had him have a robot  alien  pear  whatever he is  have a little voice like  I am located Oh a G_P_S_ system  internal G_P_S_. Although if it's sitting still for too long. Yes I Or little Or just just a wheel  you know. Just if you like you'd have a remote for your remote  that'll. zoom Yeah. Hmm. All kinds of possibilities. Yeah. Oh. Wow. 'Cause you've had like the most typing and organising to do. Yeah  I guess How much of your PowerPoint was already done for you  every meeting. Oh. Okay. Yeah  I didn't even think about adding slides  'cause I would just get slides with titles on them and fill them all in w didn't even think about adding more. Ah yeah.. Right. No  no  definitely not. We No  I don't think we need to I think the R_ and R_  especially if the yellow and black one. Or yellow and blue. Lemme go to the web page. Finish meeting now. Yeah. I guess it i it sort of a grey  isn't it? Yellow and grey  but then the slogan's in blue. Yeah. Well we don't have the right colour clay anyway. Well we're not  sadly  going to actually be producing this  so. Potato mango shaped remotes. I can't believe a whole day is gone. I don't feel like it's been that long. Get sucked in. Mm I haven't gotten questionnaire eight yet. Right  do you wanna start? Okay  um What We call that one the rhombus  uh the rhombus. Um this one is known as the potato  uh it's it's a how can I present it? It's an ergonomic shape  so it it fits in your hand nicely. Um it's designed to be used either in your left hand or or in your right hand. Um I've gone here just for just for four buttons on this one. Um the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume. So you've got volume up and volume down on the other side here. Um the red ones are for uh changing channels  channel up and channel down and that's um moves between your favourite channels that you've selected. Uh this middle button here brings up the on-screen menu and when you're working in the on-screen menu you use the other four buttons to navigate around the menu system and the middle button uh to select and that's basically it  that's the potato. Uh that would be one of your channels  basically  so like channel zero would be t to switch switch the machine off  yeah. Um not really  it would make it hard to turn the machine off  to turn your T_V_ off. Yeah yeah  that that'd be one way of doing it  yeah. That'd work  yeah. Let's pass. So that's So that's our three prototypes. Um basically  in terms of making decisions  what we'd need to do is first of all decide on a form uh which of the three different shapes we want  then decide what kind of button layout we want  how many buttons  and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons and if we wanna put any text on the device  like label on the buttons or put a brand name or or a logo on it or whatever. Would Yeah  but we don't want it to look like a kids' toy. Yeah. I think it would be difficult technologically  because if your if your remote's lost it's probably under the settee and in that case you can't you can't send an infrared sing signal to it to find it  s so it's I'm not quite sure how it would work and then I wonder if it's if it's more just a gimmick then anything else. Uh I mean ho how many times do you really  seriously lose your remote control and would would a device like that actually help you to find it? Yeah  it's possible  yeah  yeah. Put an extra the button on. Cool. It makes look more fruity as well. It's like a deformed foot  I dunno. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is  it's the up and down buttons are used for scrolling up and down for a list of choices. You find the choice that you want and you press uh you press the right button uh. Yeah. Yeah  so they're used for going into and out of your submenus  yeah. Potato. I'll go for two. I think it's it's functional  it's also pretty basic  so I'll give it a two. I'd say it's technologically it's not it's not unique  I mean it's it's just it is just pushbuttons um  so I I'd give it a four. I'll say one. I wonder if it bounces when you drop it. Yeah. Yeah I'd I'd give it a one. Uh um. Yeah. Yeah  Yeah. Mangoey is better  yeah. I like mangoes. Uh two. Uh one. Yeah  yeah. Yeah I'll I'll say two. I think it it's probably a little harder then most remotes to learn  because you have to you have to use the menu system and you have to tell it what your favourite channels are and that could take a bit of learning at first  but once you've  yeah once you'd learned how to use it  I think it is a lot easier. So I'd I'd give it a four. Yeah. Yeah. Um I'll give it a five 'cause i it would be easy to lose something like that  yeah. I'll give it a two. Three. Guess it's double-curved. It is pretty curvy. Special colours  isn't it? We've got five. Oh six. Yeah. Yeah. What was our target price again? Twelve point five. So we're just just about there. Yeah. I think we've been successful in that we've achieved almost all of the design goals that we've set and we've come up with a finished project and we just about got cost. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. That's cool. Let's all let's all go for the yellow Break the stem off. That was bound to happen Mm. Yeah. I think. Yeah. We didn't we didn't use the whiteboard that much. Yeah. Uh we we worked together  um but we were making like we sort of made different shapes and then discussed how the how the buttons might work  um and how we could like improve on the on the design. I think we did well in first of all giving our meetings the time  and second we actually we we did a good job of making firm decisions at the ends of the meetings. And I I know what happens sometimes is that you tend to sort of have meetings and then people sorta drift away without anything actually really being decided. But I think here we got we got clear and and decisive decisive points at the end of the meetings  so that we we knew where to go on from there. Yeah. Yeah  for some of the meetings  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I could Could the middle button of the on-screen menu function as a power button? If you like held it down  that would be on off. Sorry  what's the yellow one in the middle  I forgot. But if it's like under covers or like in a couch you still can't see it. I feel like this is simil or it's sort of what already exists so if we're trying to think of something sort of like new and fun  even though this is like what you're init I'm initially drawn to  just 'cause it's like comfortable and like not different. I sort of like this one  like I I don't know why  it just it's like small but still sort of like cute looking  I dunno. But I also like the b the side buttons on that one  like I think that's kind of neat. But I dunno how much any of this has to do with the fashionable  sort of cool looking thing that we also need to focus on. Ah  there we go. Well do we w like I think we're supposed to have one that we do it for. That was I was a little vague on what exactly I'm supposed to do  but let me I have to like write something on the whiteboard  so. No  I actually don't have like a PowerPointy thing  'cause I think it would be redundant. I dunno. Okay  so which one are we sort of roughly looking at to address whether or not it meets our s um necessities  the yellowy one is that Okay  well we can obviously change it after we go through each different one. So basically what we need to do is some of the things that we've talked about before we need to make sure that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to. So what we sort of wanna do is that we each need to separately rank each of the following things and then I'll tabulate an average just to make sure that it does meet that. So we'll just go through them one at a time and we'll just go around and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true and seven being not true at all  or false  if the remote that we've created conforms to the following criteria. So we can do this one first. First we wanna know if it meets the fancy look and feel um objective. So like in my opinion the for now at least  the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so I'm gonna say it's like a three. That's just my opinion. What does each of you Okay  well give it a number  sorry. Okay. And two  awesome. Alright  and same sort of scale for functionality  is it functional? I think it's extremely functional  I'm gonna give it a one. One? Okay. Okay. Well there's some other ones  I will address that  yeah. Awesome  okay. Um we wanna know next if it's technologically innovative. Yeah  she said it was one. Um is it technologically innovative? Mm. Not really  I mean not so much  'cause we we don't have the L_C_D_ screen  we don't have fancy chip. Other than what it looks like  I dunno if it's really I kinetic battery is a big one  so. Mm. But it but we know it's there. And if it's made of like latex  that whole idea  that's pretty cool. I'll give it a three. 'Cause it we could've picked a lot of features that would've made it really Alright. Everyone else? Mm 'kay. Next  is it easy to use? Just so you know  easy to learn will be separate  so don't overlap them. I think it's really easy to use. I'll give it a two. Alright. Um we next wanna see if it has a spongy quality and if indeed it's made of latex or rubber I it's spongy all the way. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Iain  what do you give it? Alright and the next is  does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables? Well  is it gonna be yellow? Yeah  but if you had like a silvery kind of white or something. Oh  yeah. Alright  so I think it it's Yeah. Yeah. I okay  I'm giving it a one the mango put me over. What are what's everyone's numbers? Alright um  and does the design match the appropriate behaviour? Remember earlier we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons  that they use the channel flipping and the volume the most. I think we really took that into account a lot  so I'm gonna give it a one. Did you say one  Rose? Okay um  also we talked earlier about R_S_I_ and wanting to prevent um any sort of like Carpal Tunnely kind of thing. Do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that into account? I think I'll give it a two  'cause I almost feel like no matter what you do  something is gonna happen. Um um worth the risk  I think. 'Kay. Alright  awesome. And the ease of learning it. I know you were saying that you're a little bit nervous about that  I dunno. It sort of reminds me of the iPod. I just got mine  I still haven't read the instruction book and I'm doing okay  so and I'm not good at learning technology. So I'll give it a two. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Alright  um also earlier we had something about losing it and so now we're not addressing that at all  so Okay  so in terms of not losing it  do you think that on a scale of one to seven  how easy or hard is it to lose? I'm gonna I'm gonna give it a four  'cause I think that you can still if it's in between somewhere where you can't see it  you're kind of not gonna find it  but anywhere else it's gonna stand out. Alright  we also said simplicity  how w how well does it address just being simple? I think overall  'cause we had said before our two main things were simplicity and fashion  so those are the next two things we're gonna look at. Separate from fancy  like that sort of thing. Um it like wants to be simple but it's not like totally totally simple  so I'm gonna give it a two. Alright  and fashionable? It's hot  I mean it's a mango  come on. I mean how fashionable can you make a remote? I think it's bringing technology and fashion together real really well. Yeah  the toggle on off switch  it's really appealing. Number. And does it meet our like demographic need sort of for international appeal  that whole thing? Just that it would se serve our audience. I don't see why not. Mm-hmm. Alright  did anyone have any other features that they think were important that we didn't talk about? And so we're gonna do that  so it will address it  fine. Okay. That's me. Whoa. Simple. Yeah. Well don't we need plastic  and Provided  okay. It was rubber and special colour  right? Do we have more than one special colour? Per Well  but we know that we're having at least three colours  so Right. We have six. Oh no  five. Oh wait. Yeah. Yeah  per unit. Yeah. I like it like that. Yeah  'cause it wouldn't make sense otherwise  'cause for the whole mat case material it's only one. It's I mean it's two to make it rubber. Oh wait  so maybe. Mm  I kind of like the buttons. It's single curved. We Yeah  they are. Yeah  I mean if I'd had more market research on the fruits and vegetables  maybe we could've taken that into account. I know  I really did  the the whole mango idea was great. No  I mean I thought the pen was a little distracting for me personally  like its heaviness  and like just being so conscious of like turning the pages  I dunno. That was a bit of a distraction. That was the last one  like I chose not to do a PowerPoint 'cause I didn't think it made sense to  so I liked that I had the option to do that and just to take my own notes and that whole sort of thing. They're funny. I kind of want one. I'm trying to think of a good pun that I could add there. I like the R_R_  that's gonna be etched in. Yeah  I didn't even know they existed. Yeah  Real Reaction. Oh  that would definitely be my second choice. I would break it. I would break it. Oh that's funny. Kind of looks like a penguin  like with no eye. I like that it stands up. Oh  sad. Nothing will come up until after our meeting's supposed to be over  its all timed. Oh. No the first one that you sent like I didn't realise that it was a joke and I was like why did she send this to us? It's very it's very work relevant  'cause people send spam a lot. Oh here you can you can view. You can just see what's up. Yeah it's it's really deep. Hold on. Takes a little while to get excited to load. That the Excel thing is pretty cool. Here  like  basically it's like inspiration  basically I'm gonna give you two sentences on fashion and that kind of thing  see. You didn't miss out that much. Oh wow. This one was cooler. I got a whole table and everything. That's like mine it was like  would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen or a multifunction remote control? And then it didn't have like any kind of table  like awesome  I'm glad they asked that question and didn't report the result. Yeah. 'Cause we weren't like voting on anything and I think usually  like whiteboards are good  you know like crossing out ideas  or like if we had had like a brainstorming period. But I thought we were good orally. Get crazy. And these might've made us more willing to like take notes than to like write up them here  'cause we all needed them separately  kind of on the whiteboards in this room. Yeah. Sorry. Well the problem was  even when we just were creating from the Excel file  there wasn't like a option to select to somehow have it included  so there was no we could be like yeah  it has it included. There was no way for us to have written down that it was really there. Yeah. That's like saying you're never gonna lose your keys  and I always do  anyway. You'll lose 'em in your pocket  like you just will forget that or you like put it down somewhere that like made sense and then not remember  there's always ways to lose things. That's funny. That's funny. I always do that  leaving it in my coat  and then like using a different coat. Yeah. Can't really take it into the other room. Oh man. Here you go. That really could get up and walk away. You have you have to have the slogan on it or can it just be like Okay good. 'Cause I was like  it could go around the outside. Is it yellow and blue? Oh I guess it is black  grey. Grey is better than black  doesn't look so bumblebeeish. Hey now I understand the random like newsclippings. Yes. I will I just feel like if you're really doing like a a really big market evaluation  you wouldn't just have like one set of source  it's kind of an they were so not backed up  it would just be a sentence like we did a survey  this is what people said. S mm  I dunno. Well we got some grey and we got some blue buttons  we're good. If they ever come out with potato I'm gonna have to Yeah. I know. ,The group introduced themselves to each other and discussed their roles in the project. The Project Manager opened a discussion about the project plan and asked the Marketing Expert to prepare an overall plan for the project. The Marketing Expert presented the initial aim of the project: the creation of a fresh  user-friendly remote control device. The Project Manager asked the Industrial Designer to create a functional design plan for the device  then asked the Marketing Expert about ideas for the sales strategy. The Marketing Expert presented an initial sales plan: to analyze the competition and to pinpoint the target marketing group. The Project Manager instructed all participants to work together on their respective design plans. The Project Manager decided that the design plans will be discussed at the next meeting  and that the next step will be to come up with a functional design of the device. 
Bless you. Yeah. Um  can I do next? 'Cause I have to say something about the material which is quite shocking. Ha. Mm. Right  um  I have been searching the current trends  um  both on the web and via fashion-watchers  and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion uh  fancy look and feel. Um. Next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that. And th last thing is the easy to use um factor. Um  fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing  but I suppose that is included in in the ease of use. Um  our fashion-watchers in Milan and Paris have decided  well noticed  that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the is the current trend and and therefore um we need to go for that if we want  you know  wh whatever our motto is. Um. For fashion  we go for fashion. The fashion in electronics. So we want to put the fashion electronics  we need to go fruit and vegetables. And also go for a spongy feel  so the the question of our technology whate is Industrial Designer. As to the material should be limited to I don't know how spongy it can be  should discuss this together  I don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go. Um. I I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and I prefer fruits to vegetables  but that's just a personal opinion. I think I think people like to have a fruit instead of a vegetables in their sitting room. Uh those are just suggestions and also we need to decide whether this should be printed  so that still has to do with the material discuss should we print the fruit stuff  or should the actual remote look like a fruit? Um  and finally again with the spongy. It has to be technologically innovative so maybe again our Industrial Designer should look into that or find come up with a solution that's better than mine. Um  yeah  to summarise these are the points that need to be um  touched in order to get a good decision  and hopefully our User Interface has more to say about the matter. Thank you for your attention. Neither was I. Well it's a trend in fashion  in clothing and um fabrics. But the screen can come up on the telly  the she said. That correct? Graphical interface? Uh on the you can have it on the telly though. Yeah  yeah  yeah. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Yeah  yeah  yeah. Yeah  yeah  yeah. Yeah. Look it even has settings. On the you can just take theirs and just Yeah but should be comfortable. Yeah I use it like that. Yeah. Uh. Well you can have it on the settings  no? They already do it. No. But also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out  because the problem with buttons is you like  they have these sort of abbreviations and codes that you're supposed to understand  and I never get it. Never ever. So Well on the telly. Mm. Did you did you get that pc picture on did they provide you with that picture on the web? That's quite interesting. What are we going to do about this vegetable thing that I'm dreading? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just nice feel  but I hate spongy. Well it could be like mobiles that just you just put a cover. If it's a small thing  you c instead of creating an object for it that looks like a banana  which frankly I'm not particularly fond of  um you could just have covers and then your mobile f it's like a mobile phone thing. You know you had there was a time when they had all these different covers for mobiles. Yeah  yeah  yeah. Yeah. And it could the colour can fit your sitting room  so if you have red sitting room you can have strawberry  and then if you have a green one you can have well I don't know. Um. Yeah. Maybe a ball. Know  a squashy ball. A relaxing squashy ball. That you can p well I see you're thinking  it's weird  you're thinking the opposite of me 'cause you're thinking you change the the hard bit and I'm thinking how do you change the hard would you put a um sticker sort of? Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit  like a Oh  okay  yeah. Yeah I was thinking of getting a cover for Which is cheaper. Well I don't know if it's cheaper actually. Yeah. So it wouldn't be very big in either like how big? This big  and then you just do that  I suppose. Well just a li I can't des like condom thingy  like a a cover. But well the question is  which one's easiest to change and we can just contact our relevant department for that  and just see what the cost is for covering that or covering that  and for now we can do two prototypes maybe and then hi try and ask users what the best is  and No. Um. That's nicer. I think it's nicer to have a drawing 'cause it's neater. Um. If it's a bit like those juggling balls  you can change shape according to your to the way you hold it. If it's got sand in it maybe  or something  you it it just moulds to your hand. We we don't know. Yeah. And the rest is the company the company colour's silver? Okay. Mm-hmm. Should also fit the batteries  which we haven't Okay. Mm-hmm. No but it does it automatically. Does it automatically? I don't know. Okay. Oh  a dynamo is ah  it's a bicycle. It's a bicycle mechanism. It's the en it's like if if something moves  when it moves  it stores energy. It's quite sweet. No. But dynamo the the fact with dynamo is  the moment you move it  it c it creates energy on its own. Which is quite cool. So if you throw it  it's gonna store loads of energy  and you don't need to buy a battery 'cause they're quite f I find them annoying. But we need to find cost. Don't know the cost. Does anyone have costs on the on the web? Okay. Right. Mm. Oh  thank you. I it's strange because 'Scuse me. Yes. Yeah. Mm-hmm. So. Oh  uh  there we go. Uh. Okay. Um. Well so that fruit and vegetables thing huh. I actually wasn't aware of the new trends in electronics and and uh So so okay  let me get this right. Okay  uh Okay  alright anyway. Um here we go. Conceptual User Interface. Trying we're gonna try to talk about  um what kind of uh how people are actually going to be using this iPod-ish remote control  based on fruit vegetable design. And  um  basically  so  this is a touched ba a touch-based graphical interface system. Uh  so people are going to be looking at this little screen. Um  kind of I mean I assume  are we still on the screen idea? 'Cause if we're gonna have to ha if we have this it just seems like in order to have someone going around and using the um the wheel you it seems like you would need a screen. But like if you think about it yeah but if so is it just okay. So  b you you're gonna have to switch to like D_V_D_ and like other things like that  aren't you? Are we Okay. Alright. Okay. Okay. Okay. So anyway if well we just we need to Okay so if we're not gonna have a screen I think I was thinking okay. So basically it's just gonna be a wheel then? And you're just gonna I mean I think you're gonna have to have some kind of a right. Yeah like you're g yeah like you're gonna have to be able to switch to like a mode where you can okay we're not choosing that  I guess. But like choose channel control  like if you wa Because people aren't gonna be able to have like  um  you know  channels one two three four five six seven eight nine. So that people seems to be well You know. But you're gonna have to scroll to get channels. So um I guess that's wh why I was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen because So that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if or or then again if you just I guess I c I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the T_V_ like what channel you're on. You can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or I oh yeah? 'Cause you'll have to like but you can quickly s you can Yeah. Yeah if you do  it w so it would have to be you I mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of  you know  range we need to have on the wheel  and um So you're either you're you know  th you're either doing this motion to like control the channels or like once once you stop that  you know  you can like tap for  um  different uh  whatchamacallits  different um  you know  functions like volume or  like you can tap just to get to different channels. Like if you just wanted to go to like from five to six you could tap or someth And then there's also the concern about you know um how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television  or if you want to um you know switch around  I don't know  like  these different modes like turn on the timer or like something something like that  like I would think so too  like So I mean and it seems it w it does seem a little silly to have this screen if you hardly are ever using it  you know  because but then again it would it does make kind of if the screen's sort of just like an option that  like  is just there and you're not really using it  that's kind of m yeah. Yeah  that's the only thing though. Yeah. So then basically it has to have some way to get to get to a mode on the television where you're doing  um You can get to you know  you can Like maybe it'll be that central button that  like  then you hit that and then you can it brings up like the menu on the T_V_ and you can just scroll around  like  to do the timer  to do the yeah  yeah. Yeah. But the remote itself isn't really cluttered up. Hmm? Yeah  well we don't want the screen I guess  but um 'cause that just it does seem like  it that would be  like  incredibly expensive  but I dunno  and then so  it just im really all you need is  like  this little wheel then  and you can control everything. So Yeah. It doesn't seem that you would need anything besides pow I mean and the power button could even be like hold down the menu button for like longer than one second and it turns on the T_V_. Yeah. Yeah definitely. Like  I think we're looking at something that could be  like like even maybe like a cir I'm f I'm seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld like thing. I mean it it needs to be easy to somehow it needs to be easy to like manipulate and use your I mean how do how do I'm not really Like when I use an iPod  I end up just kind of using my index finger to like control it. So Yeah. Or your thumb or something. So Yeah. Yeah  so Mm yeah. Yeah  so but I mean I think it could be pretty small. Like  I d I mean  you you want it to be large enough that you can But can't you just get K Yeah  But  I mean  do you need that? If if you can get to  you know if so long as you're able to bring up the menu on the T_V_ screen. That keeps it really Yeah. Uh you wouldn't I don't I just don't think you would even need it. So Mean I mean you can do it  you it's it doesn't seem that hard. I mean I've never bought a remote. It sounds like this remote's going to be purchased separately from the television  which is a little My I've never bought just a remote  like  so I don't I don't really know. But um So  um but I mean it's I've never had a hard time with like my remotes  like bringing up the menu screen if you need to like change the date or whatever  you know. And I don't think that should uh that should be too hard. Yeah. Yeah. Well so So  do we need I dunno. Well I guess we have to you know think about But I mean you just basically need the output signal you know to be able to bring it up. That's what it does anyway. Yeah. Yeah. So  but oh  you mean if we have this screen like the iPod screen? On the telly  okay  yeah. So yeah I think  I mean  I think I think the touch-based graphical interface is a really uh cool idea because you know it is so obnoxious to like have to push those like okay now I hit this you know  you have your little guide out and you're like  hit this button twice  like to activate the date. Yeah. I guess. And it is trendy  the iPods are really hot right now  so Um  yeah  by web research  yeah  so Oh. Yeah. Oh  okay  that would be cool. Mm. Yeah  c that's e that would be kind of oh  you know  usually like the touch pad things are kind of a hard plastic typ mouse type  you know  thing. But what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kinda so you're like Or what if we integrated the the uh the f what if the whole thing about the fruit and vegetables we somehow made it tactilely fash you know  we c tapped into that  so like it feels like a vegetable. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You could name it after fruits and vegetables  or Yeah. So I think yeah  colours. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Unfortunately they don't have silver fruits and vegetables. I do I dunno. Um That's in the shape of a fruit  like a Yeah. Oh I like that shape. Yeah. Yeah. It's like it has to be s yeah. Yeah. What if  yeah  what if the squishy  oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable  and you can so so maybe one you know you can have like the broccoli squishy thing  and then you could have like the banana squishy thing and you could get you could have your choice  you know? Yeah. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I think uh and I think the handhe I think the handheld part is definitely So you could make that into the fruit and vegetable part. Yeah. So where are the fruit and vegetables now? Fruits and veg. Yeah. Yeah. We could promote the banana one. Like mm. Mm. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah  I think  um it'd be interesting to have the b the squishy bit. The part that you  yeah  can change into the different  you know  trendy vegetables and fruits. But uh it Yeah. Yeah. The dynamo would be interesting. Oh. Hmm. Hmm. Cool. Hmm. Yes. Sure. So I've been looking at the components design. Um. Mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting. Um  so we need some custom design parts  and other parts we'll just use standard. Um  I assume we'll be custom designing our case  probably a hard plastic or some other material case  to protect the remote and the locator. And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board  because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time. But once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out. Um  standard parts include the buttons and the wheels  um the iPod-style wheel. The infrared L_E_D_ is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it. Um  we need a radio sender and receiver  those are standard. And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote. So we have some material options. Um  we can use rubber  plastic  wood or titanium. Um  I'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy. Um  and the rubber case requires rubber buttons  so if we definitely want plastic buttons  we shouldn't have a rubber case. And  hmm? Uh  well we can use wood. I don't know why we'd want to. Um and also we should note that if we want an iPod-style wheel button  it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip. We can't use the minimal chip  we need the next higher grade  which is called regular. I don't think it's much more expensive  but it is more expensive. So that's what I've got on design. You need a screen with music because you're looking for a specific song  like you know that band or whatever. With T_V_ channels it's  you know  one two three. So Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My flatmates actually had one with a wheel  and it it did show up on the T_V_. They have to r wheel really fast. But I think the wheel goes through like a hundred channels  at least on theirs. It's more expensive according to the design people. You have to get a an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in  which is more expensive than the regular chip  which is more expensive than the minimal. Mm-hmm. Yeah. W when we had the wheely remote control  we it was on the top I think  if you held it like that. Yeah well it had the wheely thing and then it had those eighteen different buttons that I don't know what they do. So we just used the top part. Yeah. Yeah like maybe something on the side where you slip a panel down and it's got a whole bunch of Yeah. Oh how they make the menu show up on the T_V_? I don't know. I believe it's ins it's gotta be inside the T_V_  not inside the remote. I'm not sure. Well they usually are. Well I guess that's right. It always comes with the T_V_. Yeah  it most of the ones we've had have had the menu button  'cause it's not like you need to have a button access to like change the contrast or something. 'Cause it just doesn't come up every day or something. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Or on the T_V_ too. Oh  I was gonna say. You said uh people want spongy. Um  one of your one of the material options is a sort of rubber that's in like those stress ball things. So  that would be spongy. Yeah I think it could work. Don't think I'd want it to feel like a banana. You could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit  apple machine and they have like the blueberry  like all the colours are named after fruits. Oh. Mm. I was thinking sort of a single ball shape. So you're holding a squishy ball and then it has a Mm-hmm. Yeah I guess so. Yeah you could squish it. I guess they would be either in the colour of that plastic face on the front  or in the colour of the squishy thing underneath. I think the batteries would have to go right under the plastic case. Especially if you're switching out the squishy part. Then you need to have the other part just be sort of a single unit that you can snap off. Well I dunno. You'd spend so much time like squishing it to your own personal hand. Then you'd get a new one and you'd have to do it all over again. That was me. Yes. Uh we actually had an option of batteries  solar power  and um a dynamo  which is something I don't know what it is. Something to do with torches. Oh okay. Yeah  the other one was the other one was a kinetic thing where you'd basically have to wind it yourself. So I sort of picked battery. We could have talked about doing a wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power. Um but I think solar power's not available with the rubber case anyways. It it seems a little weird for a living room anyways. Didn't have enough data to actually All it said was it gave sort of relative  some chips are more expensive than others  sort of things. It didn't give me any actual cost. Most of the stuff is pretty cheap though bought in bulk. So I don't think it's that much of a problem. Like the chip is probably the most expensive part. Um  for things like remote controls  um  they stamp out a chip  calculators too I think. Um  so you can mass produce 'em pretty cheap. But it's not like a computer  you can't like reprogramme your remo remote controls  it's like stamped onto the chip. Yeah. Case is what we were discussing yeah. Hi everyone  hope you had a nice lunch. Um. Alright we're moving on to conceptual design. Um  I'll just review what we did in our last meeting. Um  under marketing we targeted our audience  and Um  yeah. That was generally how helpful that was. Um  then we considered some design options with how it should look  um  we discussed an iPod-like button system which  uh  we haven't concluded but we're Right  um So  if you all have presentations to do  we can see what where you've come from our last time. Does everyone have presentations? Okay. Would anybody like to go first? Okay. And why not wood? And why not wood? 'S good. Hmm. Mm. I think it's the next it's the blue one  yeah. Yeah but you're not gonna wear your remote control. Oh we s hadn't discussed it last time. You need a screen for it? We're  um  we're actually not having D_V_D_  that was one of th I I was sorry  I I meant to update you on that. Um. Yeah. Yeah. You've Yeah  I know what you're saying  you have to But but imagine someone with s But i what if you have satellite and you have like two hundred channels. Then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah I mean with that many options  you'd uh I'd think that the screen would be better  because you could have that menu option  sort of Yeah. Yeah. Uh. Mm. Mm. Yeah. So the T_V_ is the screen  that yeah So it would have all these different options of changing to Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Um  right. What if I mean  if you're thinking of the design of it now  like the a you know  physical attributes  um  and you just have this  it's like just a long silver thing  or whatever we're thinking. I mean are you you gonna have any buttons on that besides power and this thing? Or Yeah. So can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before. I mean okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  I've seen some people just going like that with their thumb  yeah. Yeah. But  were there buttons on there as well? Mm. Yeah. Yeah. What if  um  you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you don't use very much? Like you so you could slide it up if you needed to like change the contrast or something like that? So the options are there but they're not in interfering with the design and the practicality of it. Do do you know what I'm talking about though? Like  uh  yeah just something Yeah  that you can flip over  yeah  yeah. Yeah I mean I guess that's the thing is is if w I if we can do this  that'd probably be Yeah  yeah. So I guess we have to look into the  um  like  the programming  how this how they actually programme these things  and if that's yeah. I mean it would y would that would be Huh. Yeah. Okay. Yeah  you don't know they mean  yeah  it's like yeah. Mm. And it is technologically innovative in a way  so that fits with the B Yeah. Oh god. Ah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean definitely the area round it. Yeah. An orange. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So what if what this is I'm just forming this idea in my head of how this thing is looking. If you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand  so like what you're feeling is comfortable  and then there's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is. And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there. Is that kind of I 'cause I I'm thinking of silver because those are our company colours. Um I mean how are you how are you all envisioning by what we've just the feedback we've just got about the A ball? Yeah. This is just Okay. Say that's the s say that's the squashy bit. Squashy. That see I was thinking this s sorry I was thinking this bit here would be the cover and like that's your actual thing. And like this you could have like you could have like cherries and things around there. Um but I was thinking if it was like this 'cause the way you were describing the the iPod and the thi the roll thingy It's almost like your thumb is farther up  so if if you could squish it lower then Yeah  I know what you meant  yeah. Yeah. Mm. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Hmm. Well that's not very neat  but Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. It was  yeah  silver and yellow. It l it looks like I don't Yeah. I mean that's another question  where are we gonna we we should have the logo somewhere on it. Yeah. Yeah  th and that would that Mm-hmm. I don't know what the rest of my notes mean because they were made for me. But if someone components concept. Question mark. Energy. Question mark. Was that you? Okay. Oh right right. Yeah. Um  so what d but what do we know about energy? I mean we're gonna use batteries right? And I think batteries sound good. What does everyone else think? What about Kryptonite? Yeah. What does chip on print mean? Uh-huh. Okay. Right. So  chip on print is just means like that they're mass-produced. Okay. And case? Uh I guess that's what we've been talking about  yeah. Casing. Yeah. thinking of like syntactic case and thi um let's see. Is there anything else we need to talk about? Oh when we move on  you two are going to be playing with play-dough. Um  and working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design. And you're gonna be doing protu product evaluation. So you'll get mm m more instructions from your personal coach. Mm. See you soon. Does it matter that I end early? How how early is it? I didn't get a pop-up thing that said ,After the project manager opened the meeting  the industrial designer discussed his preference for making a remote which is single-curved  made of rubber  contains an LCD  has a docking station to recharge the batteries  and uses a simple chip. The user interface designer discussed how speech recognition could be useful to users who often lose their remotes  the layout of the interface  and the option to include a scroll device on the side of the remote to access a menu containing extra features. The marketing expert discussed the results of trend-watching reports and his preference for a banana-like remote for younger people and a traditional remote for older people. The trend-watching reports indicated that products should be fancy  innovative  easy to use  in fruity colors  in soft and spongy materials  and in hard materials in autumn colors with square shapes with round edges if appealing to elderly people. The team discussed case shapes  color options  types of rubber  and dimensions. The team then made decisions regarding energy sources  components  and the remote interface. 
Hmm. E excuse me I forgot my copy. No  not mine yet. Yeah. Uh can I have Oh sorry s Mm-hmm. Mm. And double curve on both sides? Curve. Yeah  this is double-curve  no? This is double-curve. It This one is single curve. 'Cause this is single curve  this is curved on both sides. So double-curve. Like this  one curve on this side  one curve on that side. Hmm. Hmm. Maybe. Mm. Should Uh you can do one thing. You just select one box outsi yeah  this box. Then move it with the help of this Okay. Just uh just uh Okay  just a minute. Okay. No input  like this. Shift. No it's not. Yeah  it's not working. Should we ask Meli Should we ask our technical expert Melissa? Yeah. Yeah  we Yeah. Yeah  these are new ideas  like glow-in-the-dark or something like that. We discussed all the new ideas  but of course we couldn't reach any proper goals  we couldn't use these  but we h we are using these scroll buttons like this. These are new ideas we And new shapes  everything. At le Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. So So Uh Brian  have you have you finished? Uh mine needs also this. At last mine is also the presentation. Yeah  yeah. S Uh is the project evaluated  that is mine. Yeah. So. Yeah. So. So now is the final evaluation  final evaluation of the uh uh of our product. How we are going to means uh at what standard what standard whether it meets our standards or not. How mu What rating we will give to these products. So of course this is will be a team work  w we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything. So what methodology I will tell you on what basis we are going to discuss all this. We will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements  whether it meets the user requirements or not  this product. Then trends  whether it is as fashion trends or not? Means because we have already stated that people do prefer fashionable things nowadays. So this is also an important factor for our evaluation also. Then marketing strategy of the company. As we have already discussed that our company is quite in the market  not only in terms of providing quality products  not only in pro providing latest technologies  but also in terms of providing environmental s Yeah. So but also in terms of providing environmental safe products  uh yeah like uh keeping uh keeping in mind all the safety issues. So Now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale. I'm having this scale this scale  so we have to do it on a board. the user requirem I think. Thank you. So. So these are the three crite criterias for our evaluation of our product. First of all uh comes user requirement. So we will see whether this product meets all user requirements or not. I I will first I would like to have your views  what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not? S So what do you think you will personally give. Seven. Uh. Uh one is means highest ranking  okay. But I think highest ranking is seven  or one? Okay  right right. So it's one for from your point of view. And what do you say our Industrial Expert? Uh d you can you can tell on on the like I think she has given her views on the basis of design  because she was our i Interface Expert. But you can give your views based on technology  whether the technology meets the requirements of the customers or not? Two. And what about uh you  Brian? You will go for one. Okay. Uh for me personally it is everything fine  it may be having good design  it may be uh meeting all the requirements of the customers like technology-wise  price-wise  but there is one thing which limits the customers  like we are having only two  three designs  like we are having one banana design and the other one is orange  and Uh yeah  lower end. And the third one is what you ge uh that is not a f fruit look. But if a person doesn't like banana  or orange  you are limiting him. No  don't buy our product  because we are l we like this only. So we are showing our preference for particular fruits  two or three kinds rather  and Yeah. So. Uh no  uh personally as a Marketing Expert I don't believe that  because whatever companies they launch their products in the shape of fruits  they give a range of products  a range of shapes  like if we see  look at the smallest thing  toffee chocolates  they give a variety of different things. Some children like to buy banana shape  some apple shape  some even pineapple shape  some orange shape. So you can what shape a person will like. So in this case giving only one or two choices we are lim limiting our customers. And by limiting them  we are limiting our sales  limiting our profit also. Uh maybe. Okay but I will I will personally won't give it beyond three. So we can Yeah  on an average we can think three  four sevenths  maybe. Three or four? Uh  no sorry  it should be No sorry  sorry  sorry  sorry  we are doing a very wrong thing. Yeah  yeah  we are taking everything  and that's I have taken it very wrongly. Yeah uh three four four two six seven seven sev Yeah one pe exactly. So we can say one or two. because it is one point eight uh two  so we will do two. Yeah. So where were the trends. Sorry? Yeah  again the the fashion trends  this also like whether it it will be fashionable to have these products in the uh as a fruit shape or something. Uh. Okay. Yeah. Uh Okay. Uh personally I wi uh I think that in terms of trends  these products are quite good  like  these products are in fruit shape  because that wha people now our fashion trend shows that people like everything all f everything that is being advertised  like clothes  shoes  and everything is being advertised in the form of fruits and vegetables  or getting them or showing some association with them. So and in this way our product is good. And the second thing  now people don't want any complicated or bulky products and ours is quite simple and quite handy. So that is also ef that also Our product meets the f the fashion uh trends of the market. And yes. It is cus spongy also. So they can play with it  it's quite good. So then I think  maybe I can give it two. So four five ten thirteen thirteen. So we can Is it fine? So what about company strategy? Okay. So what about you  Brian? Yeah  and me also  like  this product me uh me uh me uh this meets all company strategy like our product should be as per customers' requirement  as per latest technology  and it should be environmental safe. So since our product meets all these requirements  so I would also prefer to give it rank one. So four six six half. So we can say two or one Okay. So th seven seven. Uh overall we are getting two something  but we can round it as two. Yeah. So I think overall uh evaluation of our product is quite good. So we can launch it. Yeah. So yeah. Great. Okay. We'll sta I'll use the PowerPoint  I guess. How was that  was that fun? Okay. Uh oh I've forgotten to mail you the minutes  but I will do. Upsidaisy. Um Um we Yeah. Alright  okay  yeah. He's gonna get his pen. Um Will you guys first with your prototype um before we get to the good news? Uh we have budget problems. I'm afraid you're all sacked. Oops. I don't even have this on. Okay  have you got a presentation to make? No. Okay so it's just your your show. Three? Oh. Tomato? What tomato? I don't recall a tomato. Ah I see  okay. Mm-hmm. Logo. Okay  brilliant. Okay. Okay  so the buttons would be like  you know individual users  or Yeah. Alright  okay. Right. That's groovy. Well I like the feel of it  I like the feel of it. At Oh dear. Alright  okay. Okay  brilliant mm. Okay  nice and obvious there  if it's standing up  I guess  yeah. Oh right  okay  brilliant. Like that from its centre. Where you're  yeah  uh were you're holding it kind of Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Yeah  okay. Yeah  scale model  yeah. Mm-hmm. Alright  excellent. Okay. No. It's out of the way as well  I suppose  so. Excellent. Yep. Okay  so so Barney the banana. Ah excellent  just what we need. Lo Sort of Loch Ness banana. Cool yeah. Well  nice to have uh options at least. 'Kay and Oh there are issues  oh there are issues. Um main problem that we have unfortunately being finance. Uh  let's just enter in the um evaluation criteria. Um unfortunately the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons  uh it's gonna cost us fourteen point six Euros. So we have to rea Sorry  I've accidentally highlighted somehow Um. There we go. Oh god  why is it doing that? There we go. So basically  um in order to save our two Euros um I was thinking that we could have essentially the same shape  but just have it flattened. Um. Yeah  I mean it's already got a kind of cool shape  so but it wouldn't have to be curved sort of in and out. And by doing so Oh no  hold on. Doesn't save us quite as much. I don't know what's going on with this again. Oh  good point. Um. That's sort of curve in and out. No  I think it means double curved as in um like uh a single curve on that bottom half  and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward. Okay  I might be wrong though. I don't think that counts as a curve  I think that's just a shape. A curvature is like the this case. Yeah  and why why I've got it two  I don't know  I can't seem to select any more however. Right. No. It's meant to be one  yeah  I don't know why I put two in there  but um Hold on till I find it  I think this shift button might be stuck again. No maybe the shift button's stuck in. Um okay  so that would take away three  which would give us Oh that's fine. Eleven uh eleven Euros sixty. Um We cou Oh not quite  have the scroll-wheel  unfortunately. What? Yeah. Yeah  I know  that just extends it as well. I don't know. It One of the buttons is sticking  I don't know. No  it's 'cause the uh the shift button's stuck  or something. No that's fine. Um we've worked out what it would be anyway. Yeah. Cancel. Piss off. Oh well  never mind. Um. Right  so that's finances and I dunno what we what could we reckon we could add? Um Well I suppose that's our that's that's our design that we've got. So Yeah. Yeah yeah. Well that's that's uh Okay  so project evaluation. We have under twelve Euros fifty. Project process  how do we think that went? Are we happy? Okay. Evaluation. Oh we've been writing this up for m months. Uh room for creativity  were we happy with that? No  I mea I think it means sort of individually. Yes  no  maybe? Okay. Groovy. So uh we're just gonna. Uh yeah  okay. Teamwork? Leadership  sorry. Thank you very much. You're all get you're all getting a raise. Uh teamwork. I thought went well. Yeah. Uh and well means  yeah. The technical stuff was brilliant. Let's buy more. Uh Right. Um I don't know what  new ideas found  means  to be honest. Mm-hmm. Mm 'kay. Groovy. So just general thumbs up for all of us then. That kind of unfortunately is too quick. Uh. I suppose yeah. Um. That's it  um I think another couple of days holiday pay might be well in order for all of you. Uh Let's see if I can get this bloody thing to work. Whoops. Does it go back in  does it? Reusable. I don't know what this is but it's really really annoying. Uh-huh. Um I have  yes. Huh? Oh right  okay  you've got more  okay. Sorry uh. It didn't bother to tell me that on this thing. Is it? Okay. Doesn't tell me. Oh you're doing that. We evaluated ourselves  we thought we were great. Mm. O okay  hold on. I wonder w which cell do I want. Okay  I didn't realise you had that bit. Okay. Okay. Alright  okay. The board working again  is it? Uh. Yeah. When the user requirement is essentially just to operate the T_V_  so yeah  of course we haven't actually got a working model yet. One  yeah. No it's it's like true is one end  and false is the oth Oh  I'll go for a one. Basic requirements but of the pro of the project. Yeah th Come on that was the tha 'Kay. Being fruitist. He's a tough cookie. Six. Five or six. Oh I see. Yeah  I am sort of pret uh Just the fruit does me in  I mean uh it might it might be trendy to some  but I'm just not swallowing the fruit  so um Uh also uh I would have liked to have seen the L_C_D_ screen in it. Um so yeah I'd say about four as well. Yeah  yeah. Um yeah  a three. Pretty much kept to the company strategy  so I would go for a a one  as we not only kept it  but we were limited by Cool  groovy. Cool. Brilliant. In which case we are done. 'Cause we've evaluated and we are within budget. Champagne lunch anyone? Okay. Mm. Very fun. Oh right. Okay. Mm. Okay. Sure. We made three for you. Um one's based on the banana  one's based on the tomato and the other one is st Look. Oh yeah  well yeah  we had v some red left over. So. Okay  so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one  or as mm few buttons as possible  mainly speak recognition. The yellow there is the um the slogan  yeah  that we need to incorporate  it's very simple. If you do need buttons  you can flip it over  and there's some there  um but mainly it's speech recognition. Yeah. Yeah and yeah they might project things onto the screen which you can do on there. Mm I'm not sure about that. Um and this one is the one w more like the one w that we looked at earlier. Yeah  you guys can have a look at that if you want. Yeah  sure. Um that one is Oh no  it's delicate. That's that's already got its stand that one. That's it stand. It does also lie flat  but that's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand. Um the black on the back is the slogan. Uh yeah  that Well  we did think of that. Yeah  if it's standing up it's it's on there  but also we're gonna have the company name on the front  which is the little black kind of line in the middle. So um and that's the um transmit the L_E_D_ thing. These are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down. We n were weren't sure about putting them there  because um i it's it kind of could get bashed. Yeah. Well  if you hold it  you can you all can hold it  is it does actually feel quite ergonomic  if you've got small hands. Um  obviously I don't think that's real sized. It would have to be a bit bigger. Okay. Um that's a speaker at the top  so you can speak into it like a little walkie-talkie as well for speak recognition. Um and um then the buttons. Yeah kind of self-explanatory  just buttons whenever you need them. Tried to keep it simple. Oh that's the charging base prongs at the bottom. We used those. And um then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one. It's not in the traditional place  but um it's quite an obvious place. So there we go and and um we have the banana-based one too. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So are there any um improvements or issues or Oh. Oh. Ooh. Mm-hmm. More like a traditional remote control. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Like an S_ shape. Okay. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Cool. Cool. So we could even add something. Well maybe we could add something  but maybe if What do you th We're trying to save money  so. Yeah  if we're happy with the design there's no point in spending money  if we don't have to. But if there is anything you think we've missed out there  then  you know  feel free to add it. Maybe I mean obviously it would be bigger so there might be more space for the the slogan on the front  because it's not in an ideal place right now. Mm. I think it went quite smoothly. W I think we were very creative. Oh right  okay. Mm-hmm. Excellent leadership. Yeah  everyone got enough input  I think. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Well um. Mm. Yeah  maybe. Oh  you got a presentation  sorry. Yeah. Mm  love to eat that now. Kind of a green banana now. It's this as well  sorry  we forgot to mention it'll be made out of kind of a rubbery latex  new material that we've got. I've got. Yeah. Oh could you pass the tomato please. Sorry. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Sorry. Sorry  carry on. Mm-hmm. Okay. Um. Mm-hmm. Um I think Yeah  it did. It had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the uh new technology that people said they wanted. Um so. Does it work? Yeah. So. I would say seven. Seven is good  yeah  isn't it? I can't True or false? No sorry tr one is true. Yeah. Okay  so one. Yep. Mm yellow. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. Is that no is that not trends? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. But in electronics  I think  it's not q always quite so um you don't always have so many choices as with chocolates. I think  you know  if you're going to buy a T_V_ maybe a company'll have That you're going to choose from  a company'll have two or three choices  but they're different designs. We were coming up with one product. No  I mean uh obviously your opinion  I'm just trying to Okay. What are we doing? Adding them up? Oh. Okay. Okay  yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Well um going on uh the specifications that we had  that fruit and vegetables are quite popular  and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons  I would give it um  well  because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at  that that looks cool  you know  so I would actually give it a three. Tha three or four  I'm not sure. Three. Go for three. That's fine. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Um. Yeah  the company strategy  okay. Um there was lot of discussing  that was good. Um I feel I got my say. Um so I'd give the company strategy a two. Okay. Is it? Okay. Okay  so one or two. One. Okay  just leave it  it's fine. Mm. Yeah  one. Okay. Woo-hoo. Cool. Yeah. Okay  almost there. Yeah  yeah. Okay. Yeah  there's good news? Oh. Oh. Cutbacks. Hmm. Okay. Oh. Um maybe we should bring so that the camera can see. Yeah. Okay. Mm. Oh yeah  yeah. This one is uh  I suppose for the younger audiences. A a more friendly type of Right  right. It's to uh induce more television watching I suppose or Yeah. Say it for the camera. Right  right. Yep. It won't stand. Just let it lie down  it wont stand. What's on the uh on the left? Okay. W why is the uh double curved two of them? Is i Mm. 'Cause that's the uh the biggest expense there  right. got two of them Okay. Well we can work around that um Cut things out. But you think it should be one. Okay. Yeah. Yeah  so we're We should fire the accountants. Fire the accountants. Ah yeah  we could add things. Maybe if you click back in that bottom right cell  where you're starting from  and then use the arrow keys. Does that work? No mm. Is it the other shift button maybe? Did you try both shift buttons? It could be the other side. That's too bad. Oh. Yeah I think we have a a winning product. Great leadership. Yeah  yeah. These pens are are neat though. Okay. Uh so let's talk about our bonuses and the raises we're getting for this  right. Right  right. Uh maybe we should start cleaning up the clay. Something we should get. Oh ok Uh. Anybody Clay covered banana. blue. It's fun to touch. Do we have the uh the marker for the board? There it is. No that's false. Uh. It's hard to know. I I give it a two. Okay. Um yeah  I think i it might even exceed it um. But I guess there is a kind of a shortage of buttons. Um I'm gonna give it a two. Two. What are we doing? We're gonna average them? Okay. So seven fourths. About one point f one point eight. Okay. Yeah round it up to two. So trends. Can you explain what you want us to write there? How it how conforms to the current trends? 'Kay. As far as the uh technology it its' got the latest trends in speech technology  but it's missing the screen  as we said  um but it does have the push-buttons  or the scroll-buttons  um but it doesn't have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism. So I give it a a four. I'd give it a kinda middle of the road for for technology. Yeah. Well it was yellow. Well  I think it's the the remote control conforms to the the company strategy. Is that the question? Um. Yeah. I'll go with two. So one and a half. A two. Yep. S Okay. Uh. ,The Project Manager reviewed the minutes from the previous meeting. The Industrial Designer gave her presentation on components and discussed which would have to be custom-made and which were standard. She also discussed the various materials and chips available. The Marketing Expert presented current trends in the market and in fashion. She discussed the current fruits and vegetables trend and the trend toward softer  spongier materials. The User Interface Designer discussed the look of the remote with the group. They discussed including a touch-based graphical user interface but noted that it was unnecessary and costly. They discussed using the menu function on the television instead. The group discussed how the menu function would be programmed. The group then talked about the casing of the device  and decided that there would be a changeable outer casing. They discussed including fruit colors in addition to the company colors. Some part of the casing will be made of a spongy material. The group also discussed energy source options and chips. The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to construct the prototype and the Marketing Expert to work on the prototype evaluation. 
No. Ninja Homer  made in Japan. And there isn't uh d it doesn't open up to the advanced functions? So the advanced functions are still hidden from you  but they're hidden in the sense that um they're not in use. Um they're in the L_C_D_ panel and the jog-dial? Okay 'cause The L_C_D_ panel just displays um functionally what you're doing. If you're using an advanced function right  like um c brightness  contrast  whatever  it will just say You know it's like it only has four columns  it's a very simple L_C_D_ like  whereas many the minimum amount we need that the user will automatically know like this is brightness or this is contrast. It might even be one  a bit more complex L_C_D_ panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the  you know  the the symbols of the various functions. That's a number pad. Um they're al along this Yeah. You have this space here  and then you have this thing on the side as well  or at the bottom. 'Cause slogans are usually quite small  right  they're not like huge so they're s Say a button's about say a button's about this size  right  so you would still have plenty of space for a slogan  say even for that. Yep so that would be about a centimetre for a button  so one two three four centimetres. Plus maybe half o five six seven eight  about yeah nine total. Nine  ten. Yep. Excuse me. Sure. Oh we've discussed how h high it is  but how wide is it? No as in the height  but what about the width? Do we need five? I don't think five is be about th three and a half. Yeah  yeah. Okay things like um brightness  contrast  um maybe tuning the channels. Um. What else? Um the various inputs. Are you having a V_C_R_  are you having you know which input do you have? Um. Yep  colour  sharpness. Um a lot of these things will have to be um free and open for users to define them. Audio  we have like your basic y your base  your mid-range  your high range. Um. Yep  left-right balance  um maybe even pre-programmed sound modes  like um the user could determine like a series of sound modes  and then what could happen would be um when you click on that then it would go to that setting. Yeah. The battery. No. Um. We need an Yep. Yeah advanced chip. We need an advanced chip I think  yep. Let me just confirm that. Yes I think so. Yep. Yeah. Yep. Plastic. I think we're gonna have to skip the rubber. Um. Yep. For the case itself  one colour. It's one special colour. 'Cause the case unit itself  the rest of our components go on top of it. Yes. One and the L_C_ display. How many We've got push buttons as well. Okay let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one. Okay um and maybe a special colour for the buttons  so maybe four again. 'Cause that's one button by its the complexity of twelve buttons. So we're just estimating that yeah it would be less. No. Yep. Yep. How much would that save us? That will only save you one. The other thing could be that um you could take away the L_C_D_ panel and the advanced chip together  um because when you do something on the T_V_  the T_V_ responds and reacts as well  so the user could be looking at the T_V_ and pushing his thing so we may not need to so when we scroll we need just some way to get the T_V_ to respond  which I think is a technically doable thing so Yep. And the advanced chip goes away as well. Regular chip. Yep. So what that means is that um The twelve buttons that you see there. Functionally you're gonna have to intercept So four is a good estimate for Yeah  so you can't actually cut It's like three times the number of buttons  four  eight  twelve. It It needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone  underneath there's actually one button underneath  it's just that the panel itself is a single panel. We just report that it has to be over budget  or the colours  you could take away s colours for th for the buttons. Normal coloured buttons. No that's not the button we're talking about. That's the buttons only refer to the pad so Should we take that off uh? Hey it's back to the original. Um so then these just become normal coloured buttons  so that might be some some way of cutting the cost. Yeah. What do you mean by profile? No. We didn't have enough Play-Doh to make it three D_. So there's one more dimension to the thing which we need to to add  and you might want to add in the report  length  width  and height. Yeah. Yeah. Two. This is about this is about two. Slightly more than two  so Okay. I think that's something that's very hard to catch  so you you restrict the number of people who wanna try something. The the look and the colour is something which is cool  but I think that there's also that factor of if it's too unfamiliar then um because when you put it on the shelf Yeah button shape might be a good idea to change  rather than rather than positioning  'cause I think positioning is we're kinda engrained into the the telephone kind of pad. Maybe we should do the design evaluation first. I don't think you need the power  so No  that's okay that's okay. No  the power cord itself. Yeah  so then you have a bit more freedom to You you still have your blue fingers. You killed a monster. I rate that pretty highly. Yep I'm fine with that. It's one to seven  right? Wait  what's the scale  one to seven  right? Okay  it's upside-down. Say it's more medium  but going towards a little bit higher than medium kind of thing. Yep. Lemon. Okay  the blue the blue colours and don't re don't actually represent the colour  except for the b the the red button  they because for want of a Yeah  the the yellow is more representative of the colour  but the button itself  the blue can be anything else. Yep  that's fine. Yeah  company logo. I think it'll be cost prohibitive  yeah. Yep. The cameras did. Yep. It keeps getting too big. 'Kay I'm I'm listening I'm just trying to incorporate the logo into the the thing  so I'm playing with the Play-Doh as well. Just in case you're wondering  why is he still playing with the Play-Doh? Just about right L_E_G_O_ Lego. You feel like you're caged within whatever y It's like a balloon in a cage  it can only go so big and not hit the side. The constraints do come in very fast. Yeah. I think another point is that the meetings um are more brainstorming sessions than meetings  so time is also a very s um strong factor  and structure. Because for a brainstorming meeting you want a structure that allows you to allows ideas to get tossed  um to be evaluated  and to be reviewed  and to get feedback and come back. And I guess that point about the room not being r very friendly to that  I think that's a very big thing  and I think the fact that we're wearing these things restricts I feel it 'cause I wear m my glasses  right  and that but that irritates me right it it it does actually you know affect how  w whether you feel comfortable to communicate. I feel like I'm hiding behind the equipment  rather than the equipment is helping me  and you know. Not not so much an atmosphere  the atmosphere is very relaxed  but the the gear yeah you know that creates boundaries to that um and and the time the time given also restricts Excuse me. I think controlling is not the right word  I think the interactions are very structured. I think structure is probably what you're saying that  each individual is structured to one particular task  and one parti rather than controlling. I don't think there's a sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a  like a consensus right  we go around and we think about it  but that you know process actually says you have to do it in a certain way. It doesn't tell you  you know  some ways that you might wanna be a bit more creative in terms of the process you know  not the I think you tried to use the common share folder to to to to communicate  but um it just comes back to us so slow in the email um it it doesn't have a  you know  a messenger will go. Yeah. Okay. I think the tools that they were given  the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don't support collaboration  I think that's the word. They don't support the team working together  you know  they're still very individual tools. We had Play-Doh fun. No  not really. I think um the the focus of it a lot was the PowerPoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard  and I think that m um is also does you know hinder us and things I think. It will be cooler to have the whiteboard rather than the the PowerPoint  or maybe the whiteboard and the PowerPoint in the same place  you know in the centre of the I think that there were too many PowerPoints in the meetings. 'Cause the plug-in and the plugging spent we spent a lot of time doing that. And a lot of the information on the PowerPoints  I don't think  you know  we needed to actually it could have  we could have gone through it verbally  especially my slides  I felt that they just you know as opposed to having to present them. Yep clunky. Agreed. Having to tick it before you go off was a bit hindering as well  'cause you're half way through a thought  and then you run out of paper and then you have to jump. But I think the pen is v is very intuitive  everybody knows how to use it  we don't have to worry. So I think the pen's good. It's about the best thing. Yeah we only needed one computer and And the computer may not um be conducive to a meeting because um you tend to look at your computer and wanna have the urge to check something  you know  it's useful but I think too many computers are just distracting. Um Yep. And we have Ninja Homer. Ninja Homer. See it looks like Homer Simpson but it's electronic so it's made in Japan. Yeah it's just a logo. Ninja Homer. The the red is supposed to represent the whatever else you wanna print on the side of it. You can wear Homer  you can throw Homer when you're frustrated  doh. It's clunky. Oh  I did learn something new  Play-Doh is useful. No it is it is. It is useful and in in in in in in in um conceptualizing  in being creative. 'Cause like you say  it's something you can put your hands on and feel and touch and get a sense for. Like we were playing with the Play-Doh and the ideas came with the Play-Doh rather than with everything else. You might wanna write that down. It's just  I'm just fiddling with the Play-Doh  and I'm going yeah yeah it's kinda cool. No  all Play-Doh is edible. It's just wheat  it's the stuff that your mom could make with preservatives and uh It's helpful to the creative process. Um it engages all your senses not just your sight  but your sense of feel your sense of touch. And it helps you to understand dimension as well. I think that that's very helpful because it it starts to pop up  whereas on a piece of paper  on a computer  on a board  um even with a three D_ graphic thing it still  it requires a lot of yeah tangible  that's a nice word. It becomes tangible. Nope. I think we could probably do it here as long as we don't collaborate. Can we turn off the microphones? Okay we all all set? Right. Well this is the uh final detailed design meeting. Um we're gonna discuss the look and feel design  the user interface design  and we're gonna evaluate the product. And the end result of this meeting has to be a decision on the details of this remote control  like absolute final decision  um and then I'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report. So um just from from last time to recap  we said we were gonna have a snowman shaped remote control with no L_C_D_ display  no need for talk-back  it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery uh with rubber buttons  maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal L_E_D_s to shine through the casing  um hopefully a jog-dial  and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well. Anything I've missed? Okay um so uh if you want to present your prototype go ahead. Okay. Mm. Mm-hmm. So w what kind of thing uh is gonna be Mm-hmm. Okay cool. Oh right okay. Cool. Where are we gonna have the slogan? Okay cool. Okay. Okay. So if this isn't to scale  what kind of dimensions are you thinking about here? Mm-hmm. Six  seven  eight  nine  ten. So we're talking about ten centimetres. That would be good. So ten centimetres in height. Okay um. Yeah. That's great and it's very bright as well. So um okay. Okay so just could you just list all the things that it does s so I can write them in the report. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay so that's like an okay button  right. Okay. Oh oh like depth of the actual thing. Oh is this k to get an idea of scale from your from your thing there okay. So you can power on and off  what else can you do? Okay. Okay jog-dial for volume. And what else do you do with the jog-dial? Contrast  brightness  yeah  and anything else? Well of the designers what are they? Uh-huh. Okay channel tuning. That's a good one. Okay auxiliary inputs. Sharpness. Okay what about uh sound settings? Uh d can you change any of those at all? Okay. Okay  is there anything else at all it can do? That 'cause that's that's fine. Just need to know so I can write it down. Okay um right I g I guess that's it  so we can now um We can now have a little look at the the Excel sheet and price listing  and see if we need to um if we need to rethink anything at all. So um for this first part here power-wise  have we got battery? Do we have kinetic as well? No. Okay  just battery. And that's because of cost restraints is it? Okay um what about the electronics here? Advanced chip. Okay um the case  what does it mean by single and double  do you know? So we want double-curved? Okay. Um. Is there any rubber at all in the buttons or any Okay  um and we wanted special colours didn't we? So I'll have to put that Oh no wait we ho how many colours have we got there? Just one colour  okay. Okay so interface-wise  is it this third option we have  the two of them there? Okay and then buttons  we have what  two colours? Like uh oh wait so push button and integrated scroll wheel push okay. Uh-huh. Okay. Okay. Four. So w why are we arriving at the number four? Where does the number four come from? Okay right  so we're writing down four. Okay. How about these? Are we wanting them in no they're just is everything gonna be plastic? Okay. So we're w w quite far over. Now we're gonna something's gonna have to go. Um we're at sixteen point eight and Well we h something has to go to the tune of two point t three Euro  so let me see  what are we I mean oh yes sorry  four point three. My maths is all out. Yeah. How much would that save us? One. Okay so So w what's our reviewed suggestion? Um take away the L_C_ display? To be replaced with a regular chip. Okay. And so we've got point three to get rid of. Um and we ha where are the four the four push buttons are where exactly now? Twelve buttons. Yeah. Do you think? Like is is that one big button or is it twelve buttons  how can it be something in between? Mm. Okay well we have point three to get rid of somewhere. Mm. No can do. Well do you want colour differentiation here? Oh yeah sorry yeah then. Right so Ah. That's it. Okay  ach that's a shame. Um right  so take away that completely? Ah. And now we're under budget. So we do have point five Euro to play with if we wanted. Um Doesn't say so. Yeah that's a good idea. Just one? Does that mean that one button has a special form or Yeah okay. Well well there we go. So I'm just gonna have to redraw this now. So we're not gonna have the L_C_D_ anymore  and we'll just gonna have an on t on the T_V_ it'll show you what you're doing  which I think is fair enough  and so this is gonna be one big thing here. Um. Right okay. So just to well to be thorough then  width-wise we're looking at about what three centimetres or something? Okay and then so height-wise How how tall do you envisage it being? About that big? About two centimetres  okay. Okay. Ach  that is Yeah. Okay we'll s we'll say two point five. Okay um so we have it within cost anyway. Um so yeah project evaluation is this point. Um. Right uh. Okay so can we close that? This is what it's the final spec that it's gonna be. Someone is gonna have to yeah that's fine that's fine. Okay. Right um. So at this point we uh  let me see  discuss uh how satisfied we all are with um with these four points  with the room for creativity in the project  and leadership and teamwork  and the stuff we had around us I guess. Um  let me see uh Yeah I wasn't really sure what that was Yeah  yeah go for that first. I wasn't entirely sure what uh who was supposed to be doing that  but y you go for it. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Oh there it is. Mm 'kay. Okay. Well yeah  I mean compared to most remote controls you see that's pretty good. I dunno like a six or something. What does anybody else think? Mm. Mm. Okay. I would say five or six. David? Okay. Oh yes sorry then  then I would say two or three. Yeah. Well it has the wee jog-dial but Mm. I'd go with three or four  maybe three. Yeah about three  okay. Well that's kind of But the yellow  I mean it could be a lemon yellow colour  couldn't it? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well yeah  I mean it's really basic looking isn't it? I mean I'd give that nearly a one. Five? That's really low. Well Yeah I suppose mm 'kay. Yep. Gonna have that on the side  aren't we  like there or something? Out of forty nine  I guess. 'S pretty good. Uh yeah. Twice that  about thirty one. So yeah ab well yeah about sixty nine  seventy percent yeah. It's pretty good. Okay. Nobody saw it  honestly. Is that you all have all finished  or Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Okay. Right. Okay  great um are you submitting the the um evaluation criteria or am I? I don't know what your instructions have been. Okay  uh just wondering if I need to include it in the minutes  because if you're submitting it anyway then Okay great. Cool. Um right  uh well next up then  because we've done finance  is the project evaluation. Oh right  okay. Right  okay. Um well do you wanna um just individually say what you think about about these four points and or not those four points  my four points  sorry  forgotten that. You got a different uh Oh yeah  they're good aren't they  yeah. Right okay  um yeah here we are. Uh as a note we'll do this alphabetically. Um do you wanna start Andrew? I don't know  just um your opinion on those four those four points really and how we used them. Yeah. Uh-huh. Well d do you feel though that that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing? But I don't I don't think it means the room as in this room. I think it means like you know Yeah. Room. Oh yeah. Well I dunno do you th I think it means um I think it means did you feel you were able to give creative input so Mm-hmm. Mm. Okay. Okay. Okay uh do you know what  actually let's take each point and everybody discuss it  I think. Yeah. So still on the topic of room for creativity uh next up is Craig. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. So you think a more relaxed atmosphere would be more kind of conducive to creative thought or Yeah  but actual environment? Okay. Okay. Very good. Um what about leadership? I don't know if that means like  if I did a good job or something. I don't really know. From like your personal coach person and stuff like that  do you think maybe? Okay. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh  okay. So you think maybe a little too controlling or Okay. Uh-huh. Okay. Okay  uh what about teamwork? Yeah. Okay. Mm. Did uh did you guys get the email I sent you? Oh that's alright. I was wondering if that got there okay. Okay  um so um to s to to summarize the teamwork issue  saying that if we could communicate outside the meeting  you know just like quick questions  quick thoughts  whatever  it probably would be bit easier. Oh right  okay. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Right  uh anything else to say on teamwork at all? Okay  um what about the you know how we used the whiteboard  the digital pens  the projector  stuff like that? Um did anybody think anything was like really useful  anything was pretty un f unsupportive? Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And point at? Yeah. Yeah. Ah. So do you think producing a prototype earlier in the process woulda been a good idea? Yeah. Okay. Alright. Okay uh Yeah. Yeah. Okay. What about the digital pens  did you find them easy enough to use? Yeah. Clunky  okay. Um Yeah. I know  I think at the very start of today I like wrote a whole load of stuff  didn't click note on one  then went back and wrote one tiny wee thing on the another page  but then did click note  and so I'm quite worried that I've just written over the top of it or something  but they'll have my paper anyway um and haven't done that since. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Yeah  that's true. Yeah. Do you think the computers just provide distraction in a meeting? Okay. I know I I like to have things written down in front of me actually  like a lot of the stuff that was emailed to me I ended up you know like writing down there or something so I could look at it really quickly and not have the distraction of all of that  um I don't know about anybody else. Um what else uh any wh I do I'm not really sure what they're looking for when they say new ideas found. Um I don't know is could you think of like anything else that would have been helpful today at all? Mm. Yeah if we just had uh Mm-hmm. Yeah I I dunno I think it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on and like my experience with meetings is that they really do  and you can spend a lot of time talking about The only thing is though like when we had our meeting about the conceptual design  I thought there maybe another fifteen minutes would have been useful there but um yeah. I really thi i I think maybe if we'd like all been working in the one room  and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just c just to have like something written down  just like you know a a milestone if you like um rather than having meetings  but There you go. Um so in closing  I haven't got my five minutes to go. Thin Oh there it i Five minutes to go. Wonderful. Okay um are the costs within the budget  yes they are. And is the project evaluated  yes it is. So now celebrate. Well apparently now I write the final report. What are you guys doing now? You dunno? That is lovely. So is that j is that just is that just a logo or does it do anything? Just a logo and then like Ninja Homer  right okay. I think it's quite nice. Oh no  that's cool  it's got I'm kind of I'm slightly gutted that we couldn't get plastic and rubber  I think that would have been nice. Ah well  maybe from now on real reaction should give us more money. Play-Doh s Really? Yeah. Did they? Okay. Play-Doh. Yeah  it smells funny doesn't it. Um Yeah like the stuff for I think it has to be  yeah. Yeah um so to wha what are your summarising words about Play-Doh? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Tangible. Okay uh Mm. I don't know if there's anything else we needed to discuss. That that's about it really. Just sit still I guess for a little while. Um Well I dunno. Um I'm sure the little uh the little thing'll pop up any minute now. Yeah  yeah if the meeting's over then yeah I guess so. Uh-oh. This is it? Um  there are a few changes we've made. Um  well look at the expense sheet  and uh it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside  so instead we've um this is gonna be an L_C_D_ screen  um just a a very very basic one  very small um with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and uh confirm um button. Uh  apart from that  it's just pretty much the same as we discussed last time. You know  just like right inside there. Well we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger so we reckon maybe that'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand. Well I'm We're gonna have again the the sort of the foggy um yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button. Um But um this button um  because it's red it's sort of very prominent  we're gonna use it as uh it can be the power button if you hold it for maybe two seconds it'll send a stand-by signal. Um apart from that it's gonna be used as a confirm button for the L_C_D_ screen and you use this as a jog-dial. I don't know. Didn't put five centimetres. Um. Something by there. Um you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons. Um  were gonna have the volume control here  but um because we've got the the L_C_D_ and the jog-dial we just thought we'd um use that as the volume. Um you can use it for um more advanced functions like contrast  colour and Um yeah. Um just whatever else we wanted to include as the advanced functions  um we didn't actually go through and specify the Uh what can a T_V_ do? Um. the the balance hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Um I think single would just be sort of one sort of oval whereas double is this sort of thing. Um we have um got some push buttons as well. 'Kay. So I reckon we've got one button for this thing 'cause it's just one big sheet of rubber. I'm not sure if that counts but You can see we're we're all very far beyond the Well we could take out ones by making it single curved  just fill in those bits. That is one. That's fair enough  yeah. That's um one piece of rubber but it's gonna have twelve button things underneath so Yeah w Um So I reckon Reckon that probably counts as a special form for the buttons. I think there's just one button so handy. Yeah. You see I envision it as being um quite deep sort of deep enough to be comfy to hold in your hands rather than being wide and flat. Yeah it works  yeah. See  about that thick. Yeah. Is it? Yeah. I'm seeing five then. One's high-ish isn't it? Ah  okay so yeah  two or three. Eight three. Yeah. Yeah one. Yeah I think it's about five. Yeah well we have to use uh plastic so it's probably gonna be I think I'd probably increase the cost. We've only got like what  ten cents left so Yeah. My leg. Um I agree with his point it's um it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right  gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money. Uh  reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting. If we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them  that would've been a lot easier. Not just yet. Yeah. Oh they're a bit clunky. Good point. Yeah. Is this for the project or Oh yeah. Do we know what the other ones are? Oh wow. Hey yeah  I said Ninja Homer. Guess I'd forgot how good s Play-Doh smells. I think they're all non-toxic 'cause it's aimed for like two-year-olds. Yeah it's not very tangible. Mm 'kay. Where are they? Ah  right. Great. Right. Okay. Right. Right  'kay. Okay. Mm-hmm  and what is this here? Okay so the number pad is 'Kay  great. Mm. Yep. Looks good. Yep. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. About nine in total. That sounds good. Yeah. Yep. That'd be good  in fact a pen is about ten centimetres usually  so that would be that sounds like a really good size  if you see it there. Mm. Is it possible uh I'm just gonna bring up the idea of colours. Is these are these the colours that of production  or is this just what we had available? Right. Mm-hmm. How high is it? Yeah. Okay. Sure. Three and a half. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm  mm-hmm. Mm-hmm  probably colour or sharpness. Mm-hmm. Audio. Mm-hmm. Mm 'kay. Mm. Or even clear. Uh how mm-hmm how are we going to achieve this high-end product if We only have very sparse Two point three? Four point three no? And then where is the Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah we could just go with um Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. How about with embossing the logo  isn't that going to cost us some money? Yeah. That's a freebie. Was the goal in your in your prototype design that it be as low profile as possible? Sort of flat as possible. Yeah. Yeah that's what I was thinking  to Sure  okay. Yeah alright yeah fair enough. Okay  just thought I'd ask. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Two's not very high at all though. Maybe a bit higher? Yeah. Maybe closer to three even or two and a half. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Um it's probably just I dunno if it's worth getting into  but um just in in that we want this to be stylish  should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid  because I've seen there's lots of devices out there that that instead of taking your standard nine nine square grid  and they have it sort of stylized or in different concept that that Yeah. Sure  okay. Yeah  alright. Okay  sure. What about button shape? Square buttons? Okay. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Mm 'kay. Do you want me to d um Do you want me to do my um design evaluation last? Or Evaluation. Okay. Sure. Um  alright so the way this works  I'm gonna need to plug into PowerPoint  I'll try and do it as quick as possible. Um  this is um I'll just go over your head if that's okay. What's that? I don't need the PowerPoint? Oh course  yeah that's true. Let me get that. A bit more. Okay  so what this is is a set-up for us to um uh use a kind of a like a The idea is that I've set up I've reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning  and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the um uh for the current design uh th or the plan  and uh so we can review that. Uh I think it's gonna end up being sort of elementary because we're sort we're in n we're not gonna probably use it to change anything but Doesn't seem like it's going  does it? Yeah  okay great. Uh and I'm gonna write up our results on the board  so this'll be a way for us to go through and decide if we're um sort of review where we stand with it. Okay  so um So to sort of b bring together two things  sort of design goals and also the market research that we had  uh when we rate this  one is v high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low  okay. So these i these i th are the and um we've been asked to uh to collectively rate this  so what we can do is try and just y work on a consensus system so we just come to an agreement. Okay? So the first one uh  stylish look and feel. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah um me uh my only reservation with it was that we basically went with yellow because it's the company's colour  and I don't know if yellow's gonna really be a hit. But What do you guys think? Okay. Okay let's go with five then. Fi oh uh just actually the opposite. The So it meant three  okay. Yeah  one is high. 'Kay Let's go with two point five then. Okay  um control high tech innovation. We had to remove Yeah  so we've had to remove a few of our features we wanted  but jog-dial 's good. Okay  three? Okay  um Style reflects a fruit inspired colour  design. I shouldn't have said colour  but just Sorta. Yeah. Okay. Right. Yeah  could be. Yeah. Okay. Okay so we'll go two. Yeah? Okay  and um design is simple to use  simple in features. F f yeah f fairly basic  you guys think? Yeah  one? Okay. Um  soft and spongy  have we achieved that? We've used mostly plastic in the end so it's going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price. Five? That's Um could we have used an entirely rubber frame to it? Was that an option? It would cost more than plastic. Okay  logo  we've got it in there  haven't we? Huh. And um it's within budget  yep. It is  isn't it? Okay  so we can say then that uh out of a possible or what would be our goal here? Yeah  out of forty nine with with zero being the highest. We are at uh two  seven  eight  ten  fifteen point five. So it's pretty good. Translates to something like about approximately seventy two percent efficacy of our original goal. Right? I think 'cause if you turn that into a hundred it would be about about thirty one  and then invert that  it's Oh right  about seventy  yeah seventy percent. Okay  good. That was just a little formality for us to go through. Yep  oh hundred pound pen. Sorry alright. No. Hmm. Yeah that's that's me. I did have one other um one other frame I thought  I mean I I d not knowing how we would deal with this information  I thought okay in theory this kind of a process would be about refining our design  revisiting our original goals. It's not something I need to p push through  but I thought should we thinking more about the dimensions  um sort of like more of a three dimensional shapes as well as opposed to just that flat um Could our design involve a series of colours so that it's more of like a line where we have like sort of the  I don't know like the harvest line or the vibrant  I dunno the Whatever just some theme and then we have different tones  lime green  lemon. It's just discussion. I mean obviously we can just abandon this  it's fine. I'm just thinking about what we originally set out to do. Um  yep so there. That's all. Um  I think to record it and uh I haven't been asked to submit it yet. Yeah. I will  yeah. Huh. Yep. I like those printer cables that just have the two little butterfly clips like that. It's really quick. To use. Sure  um so what is it you're asking of me now? Or sort of our work on setting this up. Yeah. Well  is it uh okay I'll just go through your system then. The the room uh is fairly institutional  but um the main thing is  I think um our use of this space is more just to report on things as opposed to be creative and constructive and it would probably help to um have l sort of a cumulative effect of we have ideas and we come back and then the ideas are still in discussion  you know  as in other words this this room is sort of a centre point of creativity  whereas in reality as we've gone through this  it's not really the centre point of creativity  it's more just a d debating Yeah  yeah but that's just the thing is the quest in terms of the the first point there  the room  it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave  and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then  you know. Oh  oh right right  oh right okay room for creativ Oh right I just looked up and saw okay whiteboard  digital pens  the room. No  of course  yeah. Sorry. Huh. Yeah. Yeah I th okay on th um yeah dif answering the question uh in those terms I'd say that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity because we're asked to work through this  but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of um okay fashion trends  say fruit and vegetable colour scheme  but then i then we're told okay use the co company company colours. So what do we do. We're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology  but build something for twelve and a half pounds  so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual Yeah within the constraints the Yeah. Yeah  yeah. So Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm  mm-hmm. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Yeah  sure. Yeah. New creativity. Yep. Right. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah  well well I mean my sense on that is sort of what kind of guidance and direction  encouragement Yeah from and you as well I think  just sort of acting as team leader. Um yeah I think I think it's I think it's good. I mean my personal views on on leadership is that effective effective leadership sort of um gives people a certain room for freedom and delegation  but then to come back with something that they take great ownership and you know  innovative thought with. In in reality I think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a quite a con confining framework to work within. And so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member  so But it's not bad leadership  it's just sort of s fairly strong  you know. It turns it turns the individual into more of like a um sort of a predetermined mechanism  as opposed to a sort of a free Yeah  oh yeah  without without a doubt. Yeah maybe not co confining. Yeah. Yeah  yeah. Mm-hmm  mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm  mm-hmm. Mm-hmm  mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm  mm-hmm. Yeah. Um did  you wanna comment Craig? Yeah. Yeah. Fully agree. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  got the email. Yeah. Yeah  in it Mm-hmm  mm-hmm  mm-hmm  exactly. Yeah  I mean if you Yeah  I mean sort of taking upon that idea  w the way I see this i is that it's uh the the s the structure in which we've we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork because the the tasks were d d sort of um divided  and then the work went on in isolation I I don't know what you guys did while you were together  maybe that was a bit different  but um yeah  but um but actually if you if you imagine not entire the completely same task given to us but us said okay  first thing we have to do is come up with um let's say um a design concept  and we sit here together and do it  well that's what teamwork is. To s to say okay go off and don't talk to each other  it's actually p sort of predisposes you to quite the contrary of teamwork. Um not that we haven't done I think the best we could have done. I'm not dissatisfied with it. Mm-hmm. I think the whiteboard  for me  is the kind of thing I would use all the time  but it's um not quite as useful as to us as it could have been  maybe just in the way that we we use it  in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings  that could have been up on a board uh you know as opposed to in like in text. Um  and then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that. I know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype and it's completely you know um abs abstract from the final product  but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss and and and in a way everybody's as we discuss things in the in theoretically and out of our notebooks  we're just we're actually just each of us discussing something that's in each of our own minds. It wasn't until we had this here  you know  like at one point I peeked across and looked at Craig's paper and I'm like  now I know what he's thinking 'cause I saw his book. But the b the b whiteboard could've actually been this kind of continuing um Think could be  yeah. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Yeah  yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah  yeah. Yeah  because the PowerPoint was provided to us while we had time to prepare  whereas I can imagine if I'd been encouraged to use Paintbrush  for example  or whatever  I would've actually used it  um 'ca you know  just 'cause that's sorta how we what we were set up to to use while we had our time. Mm-hmm. Yeah. No  not quite. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sure  yeah. Yeah. Yep. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm  mm-hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm  mm-hmm  mm-hmm. And o on the topic of the technology  it just occurred to me that we actually didn't need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files. It just occurred to me that they all We only actually needed one computer. If there had been a fifth  that coulda just been sitting there ready to go the whole time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yep. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well  the w main one for me is that uh the process na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other. So  that's kind of a new idea for me is like just sort of that idea  well you know it's kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when when you're told you must now work away from your team. Oh yeah. Yeah  yeah. Mm-hmm  mm-hmm  mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Great. So it So now we I I don't know. Hmm. What did you call it? Huh  huh. Logo. Huh. Mm. Mm-hmm. Fashion technology or something. Hmm  hmm  hmm. Hmm. Yeah  yeah. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Huh. Huh. Yeah. Yeah. No  it's true  yeah. Hmm. And some Play-Dohs are actually I think edible aren't they? Wow  hmm. Huh. Yep. Taste. Yeah. Mm-hmm  yep. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm  mm-hmm  mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Do we retreat to our  to continue our r reporting or what i ,The project manager opened the meeting and had the team members introduce themselves by name and their role in the project. The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team and then had the team members participate in a tool training exercise in which each member drew his favorite animal on the white board and discussed what he liked about the animal. The project manager also discussed selling prices and the project budget. The team then discussed their experiences with remotes  focusing on various features they would like to see in the remote they will produce  as well as features they find unappealing in current remotes. 
Yes. Mm-hmm. Okay  I accept the minutes. Is that what we're supposed to say? Okay. Excellent  thank you. Okay. Okay  that looks good. Alright. Thank you very much. Um. One of the the biggest issues I found about um from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these um remote controls and I think that this is an opportunity to really take Real Reaction in the direction of of similar of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to kind of bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible um useful electronic device  as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you. So um my main goal here is to re-envision the remote control in in this context and to think about menu functionality and current technology and the fact that it could be interactive with other tools. Um some of the research uh in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now  and um that means we do need to make some decisions about what what keys or or buttons on the on the remote control to perhaps keep and and what ones to discard. And if we devote some energy into this  I think the um recent productions of Real Reaction  the I go everywhere power and the high definition D_V_D_ players although it makes immediate sense to have our remote control interact with these  I think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools. And um in fact I think the high definition D_V_D_ players and all of this will come along in the uh will only benefit from the positive feedback from our well designed tool. So again  most uh users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls. Um fifty percent I think of all these uh numbers the most important is fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons. And eighty percent of users  and if we think about this there are a lot of uh television  D_V_D_  stereo remote control users out there  eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy. Um it was market research and there were a hundred people in the room  so eighty out of a hundred said they would spend more money. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well I think we can I I think we can really focus on this remote and and again bring the Real Reaction um brand in in and and get some positive marketing for our other tools  even if we directly don't um advertise for the I go everywhere line. So an interesting um element was the would you pay more for speech recognition question. So these market research uh uh questionnaires looked into your your uh concern about technology and s specifically wanted to find out information about speech recognition. Now the early adopters  those of us who grew up with technology and uh luck lucky for us have the uh cash to to pay for it  the young age group without the mortgages and responsibilities  ninety one percent of them would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control. Very interesting  I I leave this up to the group to decide if we wanna use this uh if and you know  the the designers  but ninety one percent  fifteen to twenty five Well  I I I think especially in terms of growth  I think this would be a very smart group to target. I mean s three quarters of the next age group  twenty five to thirty five are interested  and uh with the technologies improving  if we can get these uh Yeah. To Um yes. Yes. But would you pay more and does it work and is it approachable and and did I know that it was it was an that's a that's a very good question. I don't know if speech recognition should be um should be included  but I think it's an interesting I think that maybe shows more about uh being open to technology. Shall I go back? Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Exactly. I mean I I I uh did not receive any information on that  but I think the competition  sussing out what other people are doing and what's in the pipeline is very very important  because um there is a question about do you want an L_C_D_ screen and and that wasn't responded to  but uh some of the larger remotes do have screens where you can navigate  you know  so it turns into something uh perhaps you all have seen uh the Osbournes where Ozzy Osbourne is is attempting to manage his super entertainment system with something that looks like a uh a small tray. You know  it's I a and I think  you know No  no  you Kate  you're exactly right there. But I think the key is to get the early adopters  people who are familiar with technology and and uh they'll be Uh  mm. Exactly. I yes  and I'm making and I'm making the the uh uh leap that people who are familiar younger people are l are more familiar with technology than than older people. Or comfortable  you know  um so I think the most important thing is an attractive streamlined remote control and to be extraordinarily reductionist  power  channel  volume and everything else is is uh up to the designers. And this is this is also supported by the market research. Thank you. That's my contribution. Or if Yeah. Maybe afterwards we could do a uh whiteboard with that your the one on the right as a as a basis. Whiteboard session. Mm-hmm. The ergonomics  the way it fits in your Yeah. Do we have um ki some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has these basic elements? Because then No  the chip composer marketing. Oh no  the chip composer sender. I I don't believe I know  um. Okay. Be because then we would ha ha figure out how much we had to play with in terms of user interface and this look and feel idea. Mm-hmm. Inspired? Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well that has another element  which is if every time you're done using the remote you put it on a charger  then you then it has a place. Yeah  but it also has a place  so exactly. That's a really good idea. Well it's better than my idea about solar  probably. Yeah  yeah. Depen Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm Mm-hmm. Definitely  'cause I'm thinking in terms of um uh the loss and breakage of um remotes  how much of that is is to do with it not really having a uh a home  a um a nest  a place to live  exactly. So if you can dock it  um you know  you could s argue that this is Exactly. Mm. 'Cause you are talking about another component  like another piece of hardware. Mm. Well I I brought up some exactly  but I think you raised some good questions about are there enough of these people out there  or are they making purchasing decisions? You know  these are the Yeah  exactly. Oh oh oh I'll make a note of that  Kate. Good  good comment. Yeah. It might be good to know um uh who  you know  who's actually buying televisions and are we in a uh uh s region where people have more than one television in a home? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  and and some of our D_V_D_ players incidentally have them  because we have the relationship with our own department  but moreover we need to to go for the the manufacturers. Mm. Do we need um let me Br actually  um the enter key I have a chart here that I didn't include. Um yeah  which might Th yeah  th those are felt like had a lot of charts. Okay  I I my only comment is I think maybe um we could somehow include an enter key in like a power key if power power was enter and pow that was my only just really in terms of streamlining. Um Exactly. Again  you know  thinking of menus or Um well if you're pressing enter  the the thing would already be on  and so maybe um when you press power  initially it turns it on  press power again and use that as an enter um so you press power after you've um well I was thinking maybe you to turn it off you'd have to press power twice in succession  and maybe power follows something like a channel up channel down power  and then that would make that choice. Well Or y yeah. Or something that has a a turning dial  where at the far end is on or off. Yeah  I don't um I wish. Anyway  uh that was the only comment about um some of the the decisions people have made  what's most important. It's definitely channel  volume  power. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. Okay  well. Thanks for looking at that. Mm-hmm. We don't wanna outsmart Hmm. Congratulations. D Oh you're fine. It's fine. I think you have to cycle through. Okay. Um and you'd mentioned I I was just gonna say  could you reiterate the new project requirements  because it they were it has to be for a T_V_  just to keep myself Yeah  I think I've Okay. Mm. Right. Thank you. Yes. Yeah  I do. Uh not really meant to touch those microphones. Oh it doesn't have any on  does it? That's fine. Uh it definitely needs uh a lot more research on like how much more it would be and any  you know  existing examples  and what reactions to them have been  and that sort of thing. Yeah  press them. Yeah  here we go. Can I not just uh do each one in order? That? That? That? Right  technical functions design. Uh well I think first off  basically I do agree with what Sarah has defined as as uh your personal preferences yeah. I think we need uh a more streamlined volume with no extraneous functions. So my method was to look at the existing remotes and what functions they have. And what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions uh pretty much the same as what existing remotes have. If we can build on this with the speech recognition  that's not something I'd thought about at all  but it's also something we can discuss. Um and and I presume we can miss out the functions really to to a video or D_V_D_ remote control  if this is only gonna be a  you know  satellite  cable  T_V_ remote control. So these are two models of existing remote controls. Uh the one on the left seems to be a fairly uh standard universal remote control. It has fast-forward  stop  play  all relating to movies. It also has seems to have channel up and channel down  which is which is more what you'd expect from a  you know  like a Sky or cable remote control where you've got hundreds of channels instead of a merely terrestrial one. Uh but I think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right  which has it also has play  stop and pause and everything  I don't think we need them at all. I think we just need channel selection  volume up  volume down and I think an an enter function where you can access it's not like teletext  but along the same lines  access things on the screen. Uh not related to the internet one that you mentioned  because that'd be far outside our budget and what we want this to do. So it really exceed the requirements  'cause the requirements really are just want to be able to change channels and functions  which is more a text on the screen thing than uh than actual buttons o I was thinking something some smooth  sleek  little remote control with big user-friendly buttons and uh a menu that you can access. Uh but then I do think we need to discuss the speech um recognition possibility. No. But we could go back to the pictures of the uh  what're they called? The pictures of the remote controls and possibly discuss what we think about them  but maybe should hear what Kate has to say first. Okay then. Definitely less cluttered and I mean but still it's Sorry I was just I'll just uh resume something else I was gonna say. The the style of these is terrible. I I I really think we need to uh not only possibly even materials  like the type of plastic used  but everything including size and shape of buttons  positioning of buttons  the actual shape of the hand-held device  colours  just every e yeah  everything to do with this has to be revolutionised. But So that's that for now. Whoop. Isn't that your job? Oh right. Yeah. It does it does seem as if we're just to do something really simple and mass-produced  the which is pretty much the same as these existing models  just maybe a little bit more inspired  but basically just the same. Although what what uh suddenly came into my head is  you know how they always take two A_A_ batteries which which is really not very efficient at all. Could it be possible to have uh  you know  like a rechargeable internal battery  like  well  like an M_P_ three player does? With that you could jus or a mobile phone or whatever. You could you know  you just plug into a power source for a couple of hours  and then it's recharged for ages and ages and ages  and you don't have to worry with replacing A_A_ batteries  which are You'd never need uh batteries would y uh yeah. And it's not stuck down the back of the sofa. But then again I d I don't know if this is within our price range or not. Well it is just so annoying how No  but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably I mean it might cost more to at first to develop and to install  but for long-term use it'll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky A_A_ batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer and you know f Mm. Sort of have its little dock that you could put it in. Still I don't know if it's quite within our price range. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's probably more what it is. We're not gonna get any resolutions by the end of the day  are we? Yeah. Sorry  I was miles away. I was re I was reading the chart to be honest. Who's got an iPod then? Yeah  things like screen settings and audio settings  I would generally do them on the actual television itself  like here you have a you know  a little flap th with a little control panel on the actual box itself. I I wouldn't know how to do it using a remote control  so um I would say that they are definitely less relevant. Yes. We didn't come to any sort of decision on the functions though. Alright  well that's fine then. Mm. Sorry  what what actually are these is that the yellow and black? From their I'll just use it from their website. Okay. Oops. Uh I think so  we we we talked about the the individual roles that we each had as well. Okay. Oy  big loop under the table. Could can I ask where these figures come from  is this market research we've Mm-hmm. Um How d I'm wondering how how ou how our target price compares with the the typical price of these things. I expect an Industrial Designer should know that  but if we're aiming to to build this thing for twelve Euros fifty  um is that a lot or a little? Sh surely he's in the wrong age group. He must be w one of a s small population. And if you want it to go into slide show mode  it's that little button there. I you can if you like  it it that that just sets it up to do a p a p no that one  that one there. Left  left a bit  left a bit  that one  yep. And then you just press the click when you wanna go on. Cheers. Mm  I haven't actually got a display on my screen. Still  I'll do without that. Okay um  now I wanna bring us down to earth again I'm afraid and talk about the actual practicalities of how the thing needs to work. Um oh and this is the methodology I used in preparing for this meeting. Um basically I've been doing a little bit of web-based research  and if I had a design team  I would've been discussing my ideas with 'em. But the the net result is that I've come up with a first cut for the working design that I'd like to discuss with you. So  let's go back to what the basic function of a remote control is. It's for sending a message  um typically um via infrared. And the the basic components we've got to build in for our twelve Euros fifty are um an energy source  the user interface and which will um in incorporate um an integrated circuit that actually composes the message um based on what the which buttons the user presses  we turn that into a message  um and then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver. Now I would have hoped I think that's my only slide actually  yeah. I would have have hoped to um do you a pretty PowerPoint slide of um my first cut design  but unfortunately the technology defeated me  so if you'll bear with me I'll do it on the whiteboard. So we want an energy source which is there. And we've got to think about what that might be. Uh we obviously don't want wires on this thing. Uh typically it would be a battery  but I'm open to suggestions. Um and then we have the the user interface. Oops. And the main components in there are the the th the chip that actually has the intelligence of the machine that translates button presses into a message  which it then transfers to some sending mechanism  which encodes it and sends the message to the receiver. So those are the basic things that we've got to get in for our twelve Euros fifty. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Well I may be wrong here  but I'd been thinking of this device as being a a cheap mass-produced device. We're trying to sell four million of 'em  um that's that's  you know  that's almost one in every tenth household or whatever it is. Um and I hadn't thought of it as being a reparable thing  you just if it goes wrong you chuck it out  and that's why I'm a bit concerned. I like the idea of speech recognition  that's a great idea  but I'm not convinced we can put it into this box for the price that we need gonna need to hit. Um  I'm I'm I'm hoping that my personal coach is gonna give me some advice on that  if you're asking me  but Yeah. Well I uh think that's a very interesting idea  but um I'm not a very good industrial designer and I don't know much about what these things cost. I'll do some research for the next meeting. Well solar may not be so good when you're watching T_V_ in the night  but Yeah  I guess. We may be talking quite heavy then. Mm-hmm. So do you think we might make that a selling point if it was something that we found we could afford to develop? Mm. Yeah  I was wondering that  because I ag I agree that there there're people with uh how can I put it  more money than sense and who are liable to buy something new  but Bu but what I was gonna say was  although they they may be buying um  you know  personal music devices and all that  are they necessarily buying T_V_ remote controls? Because they probably live in a household that has a T_V_ if they're at the lower end of the age range  I don't know. Mm. I think we've got a big hill to climb here  haven't we? I mean we've gotta persuade people who've got a remote control 'cause it came with the telly that they should buy our product instead. Right  good point. Yeah  yeah okay  yeah. Yeah. Yeah  good point. Mm-hmm. Do you want the gizmo? H how does that work? How so so how does that work  how do you avoid switching the thing off when you actually wanna press enter? Okay  yep  mm-hmm. It's not getting a bit complicated? Could granny do this  or are we just not aiming at granny? Mm. Uh. How do you do that? How do you make it do both? Ah okay  it toggles through  yeah. Yeah. Sounds good. Okay. So we're still in meeting  aren't we? Okay. Uh it fell off. One  two  three  four  yeah  we're ready. Okay. Welcome to this second meeting. Um it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutes um for this meeting. This is a meeting on functional design. Um and I wanna welcome you all and thank you all for doing some research in between. Um I did took the minutes from the first meeting and I'll show them to you in a moment. Um I know each of you have a presentation and um in thinking about the forty minutes  I thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes  um each of you having about seven minutes or maybe a little more  maybe a little less for your pre presentations and a little discussion  because there's I happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some uh decision on what functions it will have. Okay? Is this ap everybody agree with this? Okay. Um and after the meeting there'll be things to be done and as you can see it says we get to get lunch  um and then some more individual work and then putting minutes away and individual actions. Um but uh now for the minutes of the first meeting. And go to that one. Um as you can see it was this earlier today. Um Kate  Steph  Sarah and myself in our four capacities were present. I opened the meeting  the product was developed uh and reviewed  and we talked about the financial end of it. Um and it had some implications  um the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons  bright colours and some of the influence of the Japanese. And we closed early so you could then proceed with your research and getting your reports together for tod this meeting Anybody have any questions on those minutes? Are they complete  did they discuss everything that we covered last time? 'Kay. Did I miss something? Yeah. I'm afraid I incorporated that when I said who was present  but yes  we did  and we did a little bit of uh team building of uh of making the pictures  but I didn't think those were appropriate to the minutes necessarily. So um as a group I think we've are they're accepting the minutes. And uh okay. Yeah. Good. Um  then we'll move to the three presentations. Okay? Okay. Mm we need to move this. Who wants to go f first? That's as far as it goes. She said we didn't need to screw it in. It's doing its thing. There we are. Now in between  as the Project Manager  they sent me an email from the powers that be um that teletext is outdated um and the internet is coming in as important  but that they want this remote control to only be for T_V_ um with incorporating the corporate image  colour and slogan. Mm. Hmm. Okay. Mm. Is that a large enough target market to target it? In real numbers  does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million? Or eight million. Hmm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. But we're not looking at whether they're early adopters on that screen  that's looking at age groups. Leap. Hmm. Mm. Okay  you had the other power channel. Okay. Alright. And we'll turn to the next presentation. I think she said we don't need to screw it in  just stick it in. And then press  what? F F_N_ and F_ eight. Next to the control button on the bottom  and then F_ eight at the top. And then w be patient. Tada. There we are. Yay. Okay. T_V_ only. Ugh. Hmm. Mm. And exceed the requirements they're expecting of us. Okay. Alright. Okay. Any uh thing else you wanna add? Okay. Yeah. Let's hear what Kate has to say. Hmm. I think the white that one on the right is  as well as less cluttered  It's there but it's Yeah. Hmm. Okay. Hmm-mm. Hmm. Okay. Right. But those things as long as we can get those components  the block  that that rectangle for the user interface  is where the user comes in of what what does it look like? What do the buttons look like? Uh what does it feel like? That's where the user interface is really coming into its own. The technical end is what's actually gonna be in there  but also it has to be easy enough to change or repair if something goes wrong. For example the battery energy source or um what if the chip  for whatever reason  breaks down after a certain amount of time  do you just replace it? Um is there any um because it may be in the same area with several other user interfaces  like for D_V_D_s  movies  whatever. Um does it have to have a a way of being segregated from the others  in a different frequency or something? Mm. Okay. Okay. Oh. Mm. What they cost. Okay. Mm. Mm. Mm. Okay. Uh yeah. Mm. It would have to sor store up the energy and then use it. Solar can do that. M yeah  that would be too heavy and it'd cost too much. Mm. Mm. Yeah. And the dock could look very fancy and that could be your inspiration of having it looking decent. Hmm. Yeah. Okay. Are we agreed as to what our target group is though? Pretty much  so that we'd be looking for the younger end. Mm. I I s usually put more money than brains. Mm. Yeah. Or do we s make sure that it goes to the man through the manufacturer? We sell to the manufacturer as the remote that goes with it. What would be a more efficient way of doing it? Mm-hmm. Okay. Right. Probably not. Um the other thing that we're supposed to do is make decision on our functions. Our functions  we've so far decided  I think  that power  channel  volume make it attractive. Um it has to have an enter key and of course the number keys. It has to have big user-friendly buttons and sh n definitely we wanna be inspired that the current styles are just plain awful. Is that agreeable to everyone? Mm-hmm. Throw some light on that. Um actually we're  you know  we are almost a half hour out of the forty minutes  so we have to get close to finishing. Ah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Enter  power as a s oh um a sum simultaneous key. Is that okay with you? Would that uh-huh. Then you'd have to have an off te off key. Mm. Mm. Okay. Mm. Okay. So I guess easy to use is the other thing that we want 'em to be able to do. As you said  you know  don't make it too hard for the granny. I just joined that set last week. Um first grandchild arrived. Um so are we agreed then of those things? And let's go back to agenda and hook me up. Mm. This oughta be fun. It probably won't go the first time  it'll probably be like a g mess. Come on. Uh it lost it off here. Uh No  it was up there  but I couldn't see it down here. Mm. This time it should be both. There we go. Um you have to keep doing the financi the the F_N_ and F_ eight to five minutes to finish  thank you a lot for telling me. Um right  we're ready to close. Um will be completed q questionnaire  um then we'll have some time for individual work to continue our research um and I'll put some minutes of this meeting together. Um your individual assignments are for um Kate to do the components  for you  Steph  to do the user interface and for you the trend-watching. Um and each of us will get help from our coach. Are we agreed to get ourselves together and then have lunch? Okay. Then that's the end of this meeting. And I hope that's good enough for her to tell her that's the end. Okay? Well I think I went over the functions and wrote them down and marked them. Um that's what I went over and nobody was objecting to them. Okay. Um the teletext is outdated  the internet is important  it's only to be for a T_V_ and it must include the corporate image  colour and slogan um which I think is more in the user uh range  with Steph. It doesn't tell me. Mm-hmm. Okay? ,The project manager opens this detailed design meeting by going over the agenda. The designers present the prototype  which they decided to make the color and shape of a banana. They demonstrate the remote components  showing how it flips open on the side and features a LCD and scroll inside. The marketing expert gives the product evaluation  which is based on the criteria of attractiveness  whether it matches operation behavior of the user  locatability  intuitiveness  ergonomic design  and how technologically innovative it is. They rate the product using a 7 point scale and come up with an average score of 6.5. The group goes on to calculate the production cost and finds they are over the budget. They have discussion and decide to eliminate the sample speaker locator and the scroll wheel inside. The team discusses the project process- saying that they had to cut out some creativity in order to meet the budget because they had not known the cost of features beforehand. They were satisfied with the leadership but felt rushed for time. They finish the meeting 5 minutes early and the project manager tells them what is left to complete. 
Yep. I think we should forgo the whiteboard since we can't actually see what we're writing. Artistic skills  nil. I draw like I'm in grade five. I'll go. I drew a kitty. It's pretty much impossible to tell that's a cat  but I love cats. I love cats because they're independent  uh they pretty much know what they want  they get it  they move on. I'm allergic to cats  too. I still can't sleep with them in my room. Yay. Are you trying to suggest something? Well  we wanna make a multifunctional remote  right? One remote for everything. Um. I think they'll be phasing V_H_S_ out shortly. Okay. So we'll have to figure it how to cover all the different variances in signals. What about something with the curvature like that matches the curvature of a hand? What kinda battery would we want to use? Because battery changing is usually Okay. Yeah. Can you with a small lithium battery? Just do it on the arrow. Fine. No  I kne I knew. Yeah. Ah. In my next life. Um  I drew a badger. Well  yeah. Uh I dunno  they're grumpy and nocturnal and Well  a little bit like the Yes. Um. And then  if you know Wind in the Willows badger. Yeah and then uh I don't know if you know Brian. He's Liverpudlian writer. Um  that kind of books. Badgers are cool in that one too. Now? And everything being Wait  we have what  sound system  T_V_  D_V_D_  V_H_S_  uh TiVo? But it's still there  so if po if we're gonna do it Or if it's not like a Sony  if it's like a I don't know. But at the same time are simple. Just bad ones. Um. D Double A_. Some but Yeah  I guess then it's If we need to do triple A_ we can  but most people usually have double A_s around. Right. Mm-hmm. Yep. We could Yeah  we could on here. Oh  thanks. I'll go. Um this is my picture. I drew fish I like fish  because uh  you know  their whole water-vascular system thing. It's pretty cool  and um they've got a pretty good habitat and they are pretty sometimes  sometimes vicious but that's okay. Yeah. Yeah  they they're easy  you know. Yeah. No I I see it. Yeah  it does look like a cat. I'm allergic to cats. Oh  okay. Yeah  yeah  if you're around them for a long period of time Oh  yeah  this summer I  oh I had to live with cats. It was crazy. Yeah. Cool. Oh  okay. No  that's good. You don't really have to  I mean  if you like 'em Right. Yeah  TiVo. It needs to be compatible 'cause universal remote controls are never universal. And what we need an insanely good instruction booklet  because you always have to reconfigure all your contraptions to go with the remote anyways. They want like the flashy lights. Oh like this came from Las Vegas. Mm yeah. Double A_. Yeah some use triple A_s. So double or triple? Yeah  if we want it to be more thin  then we'd probably wanna go with a triple A_. Right. Okay. Hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting um for our new product that we're gonna be designing. Um I'm Mandy and I'm the Project Manager. And I know all your names again  Courtney  Fenella and Amber. Alright. Okay  so first let's go through this PowerPoint. I wonder what button I press? Yeah  or how about I just click? Okay  here is our agenda for this meeting. Um we're gonna start with our opening which was our introductions. We're gonna get to know each other a little bit better. Um tool training  we're going to  I guess  figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles. Um we're gonna make a project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting. Okay  here is our project. We're gonna make a new remote control that's um original  trendy and also user-friendly. And how we are going to do it is each of us is going to um We're gonna have discuss the functional design first  how is it gonna be used  what's the actual goal here  it has to operate T_V_  blah blah blah. And we're going to do individual work on that and then meet. Same thing with conceptual design. Just the basic overview of the project and then we're going to do individual work  meet. That's pretty much the the whole process for today. And then the detailed design  just more in-depth  get the actual schematics of the remote. Okay. Alright. First we're gonna start off by using our tools. And the whiteboard thing  do you guys wanna give that a try even though the ink wasn't working or do you wanna do it on here. Alright  let's go forward then. Um right now so we're all gonna draw our favourite animal and then sum up our favourite characteristics of that animal. Even if you are not a good drawer like me. Alright. Um. Bless you. Oh do I. 'Kay  about one more minute. Okay. Okay. And who would like to start us off? Alright. Only if they're piranhas. Alright. Who wants to go next? No  it looks like a cat. I love cats  too. I'm a cat person. Uh. If you're around one I had a roommate who was um allergic  but if she was around my cat forever she became used to it  you know  it's weird. Okay. Okay  Fenella? Badger. Good choice. Why a badger? Alright. Okay. And I'm last. 'Kay. Look at my sad sad giraffe. No  no  no  it ends up looking like some kind of a dinosaur  but whatever. I don't know even much about giraffes  but I just love the way they look. They're just such odd creatures  you know. I I like that they're so unique and individual  I guess. I don't know much about their behaviour or anything  though. Only seen a couple in zoos. Yeah  but you can appreciate the way they look. Okay. Alright. Guess we're getting straight back into business here. Um the selling price for our remote is going to be twenty-five Euro  and our profit aim is fifty million Euro. We're going to make this an international product marketed in the States  in Europe  in Asia. And um our production cost to make that profit is gonna be a max of twelve fifty Euro per remote. Okay. So we're gonna talk for a little while. Um here are some topics that we might be able to discuss. Expe our experiences with remote controls um  our first ideas about this new remote  anything that you can bring to the table for this project. So. Yeah. You wanna start us off? Anybody have anything to offer? Right. TiVo. They're never universal. That's right. Esp e especially if you buy a a not big product  D_V_D_ player  say  usually it doesn't work if it's not one of the Yeah. Yeah. Something from Sam's club. Yeah. Yeah. 'Kay  and um another thing that I think is important is the d the design of the product  how it feels in your hand. If it's just flat and kind of boring th those don't Nobody wants to buy those any more. They want the ergonomic ones. Yeah. Ones that ones that look high-tech  too. Right. So that people like my mother can use it. Yeah. 'Kay. Anybody have any experiences with remote controls that they can remember that Yeah. That's true. Do some of them use triple A_s though? Okay. Okay. Yeah. But that has to do with the size of it too. Well  w as long as we know that issue is Here we can Triple A. But it's okay  we don't have to decide about it now  just as long as we remember battery type and size is important. Hey. Anything else? Alright. Moving along. Oh  we're closing the meeting. Next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes. Here's what we're going to do. Um the I_D_  which is who? Okay  you're going to think about the working design. What do you think that means? Okay. And U_I_D_  the technical fun functions design  making sure it does everything that we need the remote to do  the functionality of it  operating all those different things. Okay. And the marketing person  that's Courtney  is going to do the user requirements specification. I guess that means specifying um what exactly the user is going to be looking for. Right? I would think so. Okay. And you're gonna get more specific instructions emailed to you in just a little while. Okay  so does anybody have anything they wanna say before we close the meeting? Okay. This meeting is officially over. ,The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented the prototype and displayed its gunmetal color  removable casing  buttons  logo  and ergonomic design. The Marketing Expert gave an evaluation of the prototype using the group's initial criteria for the remote. The group decided that enough of their initial ideas and criteria for the remote were satisfied to be able to continue with the project. The Project Manager analyzed the final production cost; the cost was lower than initially projected  at 11.2 Euros. The group decided to use one lithium battery instead of several triple A alkaline batteries. The Project Manager then led a discussion on the project process. The group felt that they worked well together and were pleased with the prototype. They complained  though  that they felt constrained by the management's directives  that they had difficulties using the meeting-room equipment  and that they did not have internet access during the project. All participants were instructed to fill out a final questionnaire. 
Okay. Yeah  my name is Francina. And I'm uh an user interface my role is uh the main responsibility is user interface. And my role is to design uh a television remote control. Yes  I'm Francina. Yes  sure. No  Okay. What should I draw? I'm going to draw a snake. How does it look like? Yes. Yeah  I Yes  I I feel that all the remote should be very compact. Yeah  those which we get here nowadays it's very long. And um and it should have multi-purpose. Like uh the remote control which we use for T_V_  it shou uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also  like controlling the uh temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners  or for heating system. Yes  exactly Yes. Yes. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah  design should be  yeah it should be different. All the almost all the remotes Yes  exactly. Are different shapes. Yes. Yes. Or a b Should ha A fluorescent signal  yeah. Yes. Yeah. And uh Yes. Then  in that case Yes. Okay. Okay. Yes. Yes. Okay. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Uh I'm Jeanne-Oui. Um uh my role is industrial designer and my responsibilities are uh uh um deal with the technical-functional designs and specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design. Snake. Yeah  of course  using remote control. Yeah. Uh. Yeah. Yeah. Audio player. Oh. Okay. Hmm. Divides us Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  of course. Yeah  maybe ten I do yeah  colours and al shapes also. Yeah. Yeah of course yeah. Yeah. Yeah  some beep or something like that  so that we can go Yeah. Yeah  maybe it should have a light so that we can  we can just recognise where it is. Yeah  yeah. May not be beep. Beep or uh it's a light  maybe it's a light. Yeah  probably yeah  probably it's a yeah  yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah  of course  that didn't I i we can't do it. Yeah  good point. Me yeah. Yeah. Yeah  it's functional de yeah  exactly  technical. Yeah. Uh working design  yeah  it's it's uh mainly technical-functional design. Yeah  functional design  and you Yeah. Yeah  even I have. Yeah  even I have  I think  yeah. Yeah  so let's see. Hmm. Yeah. Okay. I think so. Yeah  that's a good plan. And I'm a marketing person. I wanna figure out how to sell them. My name is Eileen. Okay. Mm-hmm. No. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm 'kay so Three different types of design that we're gonna be concerned with okay. Functional  conception and detailed. Maybe we should redesign it. After we've finished the remote control we'll get to that. Okay  I'll see what I can do. See if I r See if I remember how to draw a kitty cat or a rabbit or something. So that it will record okay. Um uh um traditional kitty cat. I've a very fat cat. And it likes to sit like that. Okay. Am I supposed to wipe off that or okay. Okay. Uh  okay. I hope the kitty cat is hungry 'cause I don't like snakes. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm 'kay that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged. Profit. Um is fifty mm. Oops. At um twelve fifty Euros per Well who knows if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that. We certainly can try to I agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things. That's right. Yeah okay  friendly shape  that would help. I think another thing that would help is um if it beeps when you clap  because I think one of the big things that happens is people lose them. They can't find it. Mm-hmm. So some Uh so  so it's really the beep or  or a light should blink. Mm 'kay. And do you think a good c c um clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond what what should you have to do to make it beep or blink? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay so Okay. So the light sensor would activate the signal. Mm-hmm. But it could be someplace really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it. Well  because you're s because you're silly. Because people are silly. I mean it could be on well  i if it were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table um  you know  well maybe we have to move along  okay. Mm-hmm. We have to justify that price by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price. Mm. Okay  I think I have enough to think about 'til our next meeting. How about you people? Really? Okay. 'Kay. Alright  well uh Okay  very good. Okay. Everybody ready? Uh I think the first thing we do is introduce ourselves and everybody's name and what your function is? So maybe we start with you? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. And your name is? Okay. Very good. And as you already know I am Betty. I am the project manager for today. So why don't we look at the presentation to see what we really are supposed to do. Um. Yes y opening  acquaintance  tool training well  the tools are  I think  we already I guess the tool is really our the computer  as far as I can see. Uh we get ins each of us will get instructions and we'll take it from there. Project plan  that falls under the same heading pretty much. Um  I don't think we have any great discussion at this point. Um. Here is what this thing should be. This thing we are gonna um uh design is a new remote control. Uh should be original  trendy  and  of course  user friendly. So maybe you wanna make some notes of that. Okay? All right. Here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve. Um. That is it's gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what uh we have come up with. The same goes for the conceptual design  there will be individual work whic and then discussion afterwards. Detailed design  same thing basically. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I can't write with this thing. Yes. Yeah  okay. All right? Then  tool training try out the white board  participant can draw their favourite animal. Does anybody want to go and see how the white board works? So that in case we have to  in the next meeting  present something on the white board. You wanna go Eileen and Whether you without hanging yourself. And remember you have to press so it works. Mm-hmm. Fat  a fat cat. Okay. And you're Francine  right? Would you like s like just to see um how it feels  so that you have a little idea? In No  no. No  that's okay. I don't know  we'll get to that later. Okay. Okay. Here's the project finance uh which  of course  we all have to think about when we design this thing. Um selling price is supposed to be twenty five Euro. Uh profit aim for the company is fifty million Euro  the market range unlimited meaning international and the production cost should not exceed hopefully should be less than twelve fifty Euro. Mm-hmm. So these are all things  of course  to remember with the budget and when you design to materials  cost  etcetera. Now  uh the discussion I guess is um does anyone of you have experience with remote control? I exp I s 'cause we we use 'em we use 'em  right  everyday. And um now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it  things you would like to change  things you would like to improve with this thing ye any first ideas? Would you like it to be smaller  bigger  have more have more buttons on it or maybe clearly better marked buttons  you know  things like that? Small  right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So it should be a multi-functional uh gadget that would um control all your household uh uh machines basically. Well. It should be something new it should be s it it should do something different than than just what we have. Now  of course  the other thing to think there is maybe the design. Like trendy no like f for earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy you know. Maybe it should different colours or materials or you know. Um so yeah shapes right  you know  like kidney shape feels better in your hand or something  you know. Yeah. Yes. That is true  because they put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or  we you know  whatever. And and they suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the T_V_ off and they say  where the hell is my my remote control yeah? Well or yeah or if it's really  if it's really in a dark spot that it gives out a a sound or a signal. Yeah. Mm-hmm. So if lost If lost uh signal with b throw signal  you know. Exactly  I mean just that's what I'm saying. I'm just saying throw signal meaning just whether it's a beep or whether a light or Okay  my my idea is maybe that the minute it's really hidden  in in other words if it's like in a dark spot  uh meaning you know like a newspaper is on top  a sweater is on top or it it's behind a plant  at that moment it's it's like  it's like um  what you call it a light s sensors  you know? In in that moment it has a sensor  i it it gets a certain darkness  it ge has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep  I mean  that we can discuss that later  you know. That's right. You know there would be right you have to have some kind of sensor and I I think uh voice or clapping it's not specific enough. Uh I know there are the lamps and stuff  you know  you can clap on and off  but I think they only work to certain degree and What with Oh yeah well  but then those people we can't help everybody. Okay we have uh yeah  we have to move along  but I think we have some good good points to start with here. Okay  the next meeting will be in thirty minutes. I think you all did you get uh notices on your computer for this? Okay so well  you got the notice um uh. The working design  I guess that's the function I_D_ uh who is this? The industrial designer That's you. Okay. So  we looking for a working design when we come back. Then And then the technical funct you are the technical function  so so you are the working design. So you have a working design and then a functional design. And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification  like friendliness  and what we just discussed in general. That would be your idea. And  of course  price. That it  that it  that the price is a good price. I mean  the price is given  but  that was That's right. That's right. And  you know  specifi you you will get specific um instructions for that. I think that's the end of the show. Yeah. So um we have well  we have a twen two two two three minutes. Um any questions at this point? Or uh suggestions? I think basically basically you will get instructions to work with and if you have any questions uh  uh I guess  you can uh Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Then uh we see you in about thirty minutes. And see what we can come up with. Okay? ,The group introduced themselves to each other. The Project Manager discussed the goals for the project and gave an agenda for the project as a whole. The group practiced using the meeting-room equipment by drawing on the whiteboard. The Project Manager presented the projected profit and price point. The group discussed their experiences with remote controls. They complained that remotes got lost too easily  and suggested using a locator function. They also complained that remotes had too many buttons  and suggested incorporating a screen to simplify the interface but retain all of the functions. They also suggested making the remote water-resistant and including a clip. The Project Manager instructed the Industrial Designer to research the working design and components  the User Interface Designer to research the technical functions  and the Marketing Expert to research user requirements. 
Okay. Could could I see the scroll bar as uh as as a sort of shortcut? A a and the voice recognition as well  th maybe you could uh could uh Yeah. Okay. Okay  good. And and the case is is rubber? And the buttons? Okay  and uh the colouring? with with grey or black. Okay  we'll we'll come to that later. Um okay. Anything else to add or Yeah. M uh yeah. M m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition  or train the voice voice recognition. Yeah al although by pressing the button for I n don't know two  three seconds  you could also say it you'd disable it with a little beep and and but o okay  that that's not really really important. The basic okay. Okay. Um you thought of some evaluation crit criteria? Okay. You are nameless. No. Okay  so this these are the cr uh the criteria. Okay  well the then we'll switch to my presentation. Um The production costs. The costs are not under Can I Um this is the Yeah  it's it's w way above um uh above the the the twelve Euro fifty. And what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell. So I guess we should skip that  because it's not that important. Yeah  the the price  the the number of items and the the sum. Um well  this is what I would call our luxury model. Um if you would if you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um to make it just between the twelve Euro fifty  um then I did the following changes. Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells  um by not using the voice recognition feature  because it's uh it's a four Euro uh addition to the price. Um Yeah  I believe Uh  push-button  well It makes it the thirteen yeah. Push-buttons are buttons are are not the most expensive  but do add extra cost. So um yeah  th this design is not um within our price model. Um Yeah. It's still too expensive  yeah. Um I I guess if we leave the if we leave this one out  um oh. And uh maybe not use the special form. It becomes a very dull remote control  I know. But it's the board decision. Um And um yeah. Yeah. Yeah  I know. Maybe we should look at an uh focus on another uh Yeah  m uh maybe not not all that fancy  but just way way more easy uh uh um basic and uh m maximise the profits and um Yeah. Yeah. I know  I know. Yeah. Although I think we yeah  but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already. Um so it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people. Um but uh I agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device. Definitely not  no. It's not that innovative. Or however you s pronounce that. Um so  okay. Um Oh  this is the wrong one. So uh that means redesign. We do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product. Um but we can evaluate the process and um uh uh the satisfaction on how things went. Um I'm not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first. I guess Yeah. Yeah  that's true. We l we can learn. Yeah. Yeah. I agree. Well I d it is it is Yeah  I think so. You like the rubber  uh Roo. Yeah. No  I'll I'll I'll give it a two. You like tita That's a flavour as well. Right. Um Yeah  I know  but but it but that's fancy in the way um I mean fancy has has a lot of Yeah. Yeah. It applies. It yeah. Yeah. Yeah  I I agree. Well  with the voice recognition feature and uh No  we are evaluating this this uh design now. This prototype. Yeah. That would have been a thrill. Yep. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Yeah. Yeah. Uh I'm doubting doubting as well. Um Yeah. Okay. Uh two or three? Three? Wha wh what would be your guess? I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions. It's the uh it's it's overall. Is the device easy to use? Yeah. Yeah. Um Okay. Uh Roo  a three? Ruud? Okay. So I could make it e easy? Roo. No  I haven't said anything yet. Okay  but if I would say a three  then it's six  and four is ten. Divided by four is two point five. But I'm filling in a three. Does it will so it will be a two point five. Yes  it is. I have a veto. Exactly. It's not about the content  it's about okay  um is it easy to f Yeah  definitely. Yeah  or beeps or yeah. I'm here  I'm here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well  I uh we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time  but I personally give it a one. Um Sebastian? Right  well. The feel of the remote control is spongy. Well  uh it can't be more spongy. So No okay  but but for the options given  it's the most spongy one. Yeah. Yeah. They're out there. Yeah. I'll give it a one. Yeah  I know  but you have to name a fig uh a number. Because we need to go on in for the time. You are okay. The remote control offers enough features. Well  Ruud  what what do you think about it? Yeah. Yeah  I know. What what we didn't talk about is um uh I think it has. Yeah. Bec because you can um we didn't talk about it  but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal. So  you place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one  hit the one or the two or the three  whatever  and it r records the uh the um the the signals. So you could uh uh uh enter any comment you like  as long it's able to as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal. So I think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features. Although there are i a few buttons  but the inside is is quite uh advanced. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Okay  um let's give it a number. I'll give it uh a one. For for the for this t uh type of market  I think it's a one. Yeah. So high quality  low acceptance. The product is is is uh b high qua uh has a high quality and and is uh advanced. But whether or not our clients are are um willing to pay twenty five Euros for this kind of device is doub is well  is not sure. D do you agree? Yeah. Maybe we should have a radar uh function. Twenty five Euros. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Bu but well yeah  I know  but you're paying for th for the brand  because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo  television  D_V_D_  C_D_ player  for under twenty five Euros. Yeah.. Yeah. Okay. Um you had an overall rating. Um That's counting. Okay. Okay. Um we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation. About the project itself  not about the product. Um What did you think about uh the process  the project process? Ruud? Try to translate that. Any any other Uh  Roo? Roo. Yeah. Better decision. Yeah. Less. Yeah. So we could we we could be we could've been creative. But um it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price. Yeah. Yeah. Okay  Roo? Any other thoughts on that? Ruud? You agree  okay. Uh leadership. Okay  Roo's on for his promotion. Okay. I think so too  it's it's it's uh of course a laboratory environment. I missed it um to be able to contact you in between and uh say uh  hey Roo uh. Um Yeah. So um Yeah  but but si uh w w w when taken in account the the situation  uh I think we performed pretty well. Yeah. Um the means  the SMARTboard  the digital pen. Did you like 'em? Because of the response or Okay. Uh Okay  so it it had to be um better aligned  or what's the word? Uh yeah. It it was calibrated just before this meeting. Uh the one before  the third meeting. So uh it's not the calibration  it's the thing itself  I think. Uh Ruud  w uh did you use the pen a lot? Or not at all? Not at all. Okay. I thought it was quite a handy uh thing  although I would like to see um O_C_R_. Yeah. To digitise them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know. Yeah. Okay. Um What w Uh Ruud  what did you think about the SMARTboards? Yeah. Okay  you can't really decide. No. I missed a feature to easily select uh a slide and uh distribute it to the laptops. I think that would be very easy if you could say okay  I want to use this for my own work or my own presentation further on or Or the other way around  that you could show but m I know. I know  but I know  but we couldn't use that feature  so I missed it. We weren't able to do that. At least the um I wasn't explained how to do such a th Okay. Yeah. Okay  so y it it's not even as advanced as paint. Yeah. Okay. Uh no. Yeah  the project is evaluated. Um but  well  we need to redesign uh the product. Celebrate. Okay. Um you're dismissed. No  I think we are uh ready. Private room  Roo. That sounds quite scary. No  let's find uh the way to.. I don't believe so. Well  maybe we'd get an email. Thank you for your Forty minutes. A minute or or ten maybe. M Yeah  ten or five. So  we can uh redesign our uh Uh I would like to Oh. Yeah. Yeah. It's blue tongue. Yeah. This is a new model. But Blue tongue. It's spongy.. That is uh it's a new feature next to Bluetooth to um disable all Bluetooth devices. Um Yeah  we're done here. Gentlemen  thank you for your cooperation. Yes. Like this one. It's important. Uh I think th this is device which which has a learning curve. Um novice users u use this device as uh normal users use uh a c a remote control. And after a while they start to develop uh some skills in the the voice recognition functions  and then they will not use this dial as often. But other users who are new to this device need something like that. They n they need to understand what uh how to change channels and uh change the volume  so it's easier for them Yeah  maybe so. Yes  it's Well  it's it's it's another approach  it's more that our um. There are there are many ways of doing uh things uh on such a device. It's it's quite easy. Yes  rubber? There are plastic or rubber. Uh yellow with uh grey or black or something like that. Whatever cost uh cost uh the least. No. Uh maybe we should uh think about these buttons. But Yes  but it but these are tasks that are only executed once  I think. Or not? Well okay. Okay  yeah  that's right. Or something li like that. Yes. Is it spongy? I believe it's fancy too. Okay. Well it's very expensive. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Okay. But I'm afraid it's not complete. Because we use spec uh specic uh special materials  the last item. And you have not added one item there. So it's c way too expensive. But it Yes. Well  b basically it when when this is our only option  we should even consider changing the casing  because I think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions. So Type of m maybe another market segment. Yeah. Yes. That's maybe that's better. Maybe we could uh we should go for straight and simple  but that's not what uh has been asked. So we should kick the board's uh Well Hmm. Yes. Well  maybe it's good to do it anyway  because if we evaluate it  we we can also determine if our objectives are good. So Is it fancy? I think so. But it's not that fancy. I mean I think uh I think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing the casing. It would be even more oh  you really like titanium. I'm I'm into it. It has flavour. Yes  that's right. You should taste it. It has to do with fashion  I guess. So do Okay. Yes. I think I th I think it would have been I would have think uh it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case. It would have been even more fancy  but we decided not to  because if we use a double-curved case  we could not use solar. So Yes. Yes  I agree too. It's okay. We did yes  we did good. Well  let's let's this product. So I I I think it is. I think it's innovative. No. It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source  but it's it's way too yes  but I think uh it's a two. Well  but there are two parts in this remote control. What you see here is is the basic part. Everybody can use it  so that's easy to use. That's for a novice user. When you have a more advanced  elaborate user  well  such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions. So in that in that way it is advanced  and I think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users. So uh It's maybe it's not very uh easy for Okay. Yeah  that's right. You're right in that  but I I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use  because he is already he or she is already an advanced user. So After all  I think personally I would give a two. But So  it's two  two and three. Two threes. So that's ten. So that's w No  two and a half. Six and four. Six and four is ten. Divided by four is two and a half. So Yes. Four? Two? Divided by four. That's not even But that's not possible to fill in  so we have to round it. Yes. It it most definitely is it's very easy. Yes. Maybe Uh I I think I think something like that. Maybe you have to uh programme it once  so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence  something like where are you  and then it will sing I'm here. So something like that. So  I th Yeah  me too. Well  it can be. There are cases um in which the outside casing is um can be uh how d how do you prono is is moldable. No  it's not one of our option  but when you look in the market  when you look Uh yes  but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about  I think. Because we compare all these uh characteristics characteristics with uh market uh with with the real market. So there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy. They're out there. Yes  but it's not good enough  so it's a two. You take one? What do you give it? No no no. Uh I'll I'll change it  I'll make it m my my mark will be a four. Basically it's it's completely programmable. You can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode. So it's quite advanced. Yes. Has uh the signals sent to it. Absolutely. Yes. But that that's its power  I guess  because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains  well  uh really a lot of buttons. At at least uh forty buttons. So it's it's quite s complicated to get uh to get used to. And this is quite s simple. You can use your voice to to programme it. It's Yeah  I'll give it a one. Yes. I I've I think we've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good  but not for this kind of market  and not for this kind of price. So Hmm. Yes. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yes  I agree. I Yeah  okay. But Yes. M about fifty Euros. That's quite ex well  it's not it's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality. Yes  it's more than fifty Euros. It's quite expensive  yes. Yes. Yes  but you can you c Yes  but you can learn this thing  all these functions. And it's easier to use because those uh remote controls don't offer voice recognition and this one does. So I think it's worth its price. Well  it's it's about one point five. Something like that. Well Well  I think Mm. Actually  we had Yes. We had we had too little information actually. So And uh um the the the well  looking at room for creativity  there was w way too the the choice of components was way too narrow. So there was not really a process of uh Well Yes. Well  in the first meeting we we already were very creative. We we thought of possibilities who are not possible uh with the the current uh offer of uh manufacturing components. So We're tempered by that  yes. Yeah  okay. I think we're a good team. Yes. Well  I tried once  but that was not allowed. I think so too. Uh. The digital pen was okay  but SMARTboard was really bad. It it's The response is very slow and the possibilities are very limited. It's not accurate. Maybe it's it needs to be calibrateds. It is? Okay. Okay. I I think so too. Yes. Yes. Mm-hmm. But I think it's a great solution for uh for uh a known problem  uh writing down some notes  some some inf uh information  and then um forgetting your notebook somewhere and losing all that information. Because you have everything in one place and it's quite easy quite easy it's it's possible to make this information digital and share it with others in a quite easy way. I think it's a good product. I only think it's th the the shape of the pen is too big. It's not quite uh ergonomic. Eco ergonomic. Yes. Yes  yes. That's quite what PowerPoint does. An object  yes. Yes. The drawing cap capabilities are very limited. And and uh w you were when you're using uh Windows  you're used to a certain interface and certain buttons  uh which you can use for drawing. And a lot of these buttons don't appear here. So it's Not not uh n not way. It's quite uh limited. Okay. Oh  very good  celebration. Pop uh pop up the champagne. Okay. I see some action over there. Okay. uh we're done  we're finished  I believe. So  are there any more cycles in this process? I think not. But um how much time did we get for this meeting? And how much time is left? Ten minutes. Okay. Okay. Well  I think we we we all know what the redesign should be. A simple  dull  uh one-coloured box. No  it's it's just the same product that is already on the market. What is that? It's a giraffe eating a eating leaves from a tree. So you're actually promoting Bluetooth. Or blue tongue. Blue tongue. Okay. Let's wrap it up. Thank you Mister manager. Now  let's have uh a bottle of champagne.. Well  you could use two of them to programme the um channels on the two channel button  'cause you have to assign two channel new channels. You Yes. Uh my name is not name but Uh well  I used the the uh documents. And these uh were the most important criteria. It should be. yeah  that's uh how the fashion guys uh state it. Fancy look and feel. So Uh well appar Yeah  but apparently uh we shouldn't evaluate yet. So Yeah  I think these are the most important criteria. So uh that's about it. Um well  since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway Uh Yay. Is it? Is it fancy? So uh one? Is it uh And w yeah  w what they want wanted was uh colours and soft materials. So in that way It it's fancy. Okay  and uh was it innovative? Yep. Yeah  and uh So uh also a uh two? Is it easy to use? Well the p the most important function is easy to use. The the zapping  channel switching  volume. But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder. Good question. Uh I'll go uh for the two. Hmm? Huh? Yeah. I yeah. Yeah  two  two  three No. Is it easy to find? Yeah  I agree. No. Uh this this was a most spongy option. Well yeah  it depends  'cause it's the most spongy we could but yeah. Well  if I give it a one there'll be one hell of a calculation. So I'll just give it a two and make this a one point five. Well  the basic layout doesn't offem offer much  but the voice recognition could add a lot. So Yeah  depends. Uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat Signal. Um I think think a one  'cause v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want  so that's like um Maybe even because it doesn't look advanced. Yeah  but uh with these ratings uh should be about one point s seven  yeah. Ye The prices. I agree. Draws. No. Not really. Oh  I only use it to draw a rabbit  so can't say much about it. No  or the other way around. Yeah. And no added value. At all. So In interesting design. Oh uh it it does uh have a natural uh feeling. So Yeah.. That's the same as uh on the top of it uh with the the round uh button. But uh we don't uh we don't uh we do think it's um well what if with ease of use  w which prefers the which the the customer of the user prefers. Plastic or rubber. Well  yeah. And a button for disabling the voice recognition. Yeah. That's the basic idea  yeah. Of our prototype. So just walk through it step by step. I mean  is it fancy  everything I believe uh I believe it's fancy. Oh  sorry. Twenty two. Yikes. Why does the price and and the s oh  one uh exa yeah. The number of uh yeah. And and does it But that's that's only for the buttons. So the button we can use plastic. And the pla uh And a plastic b just plastic buttons  a plas uh instead of rubber. Yeah  too bad. Mm-hmm. Um the yellow rubber  I think so. I'm into it. It's trendy trendy  fun yeah. Well  just give it a two. It's not the ultimate uh fancy two  but Yeah  but that's sti that's uh Looking at the user uh needs  we only uh don't we don't have the double-curved case. We w we do have uh the rubber  we do have the colours. That's two out of three. So I believe uh we are close uh to two. But that's not in it. Ov or can we Okay. And the scroll uh wheel. The solar not many remotes have the solar  I think. Yeah. Well yeah  the voice recognition of course is hard to learn  I think. Well  hard it's not for the for the e for the elderly. They won't use it. I think I think a three. Wouldn't give it more. Yep. If you make it a four it will be three in general. If he makes it a four. Not a three. Darn. Nee. A seven  a three No. A four and a three together. Yeah  you have a two  he has a two. Three? And a three? Nee. I know. Yes. So if you want to have the conclusion as a three three. Then you would make a four. If you fill out a four Yeah  we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out  but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find. Yeah  but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh But even without it Yeah. Me too. Was it one of our options? So  in the in Yeah. But I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could. I wan I'll take one. It will be a one. Yeah  but it ha doesn't has the digits. I believe it's If you uh ask yourself it offers enough features  I don't I don't think it is it has all the features um a normal remote has. Yeah. I'll give a two. But we could couldn't uh what what's the selling price? Fifty? Uh twenty five. And costs were twelve fifty. But even now  if only our production costs w uh were exceeded the double  Think. Production cost was were t uh was twenty two? So uh selling price uh would be uh yeah. That's price  but w w No. An original remote control of any T_V_ kind  uh a Phillips remote control  y you pay uh Yeah  I kn I know uh from a few years ago  it it it costed hundred Gilders. Four six seven eight. Nine divided by six. Hmm. Yeah  I think uh The process was good. But w um we weren't aware of the prices of the costs. And and that was the the big deal. I if we knew that before  we c we could have made the the choice between what yeah. No  no. Fantastic. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Response and Uh it it has yeah. Yeah  it's not accurate. The p the pointing of the pen is not um the place where it it writes its um uh where it uh Yeah  where it draws. It's uh the drawing on on the b on the board is r right from the pen. So uh You to take in account that your you m yeah uh It's too slow Hmm. Yep. If it has O_C_R_  uh I think uh I would use  but uh I I just uh took notes for myself and and and that's it. It w it w yeah. It was necessary for me to uh Yeah  because if I want something on the computer  I just type it. I type faster than I write. So Economic. Yeah. But y you can if you save this image  you can open it in your shared work folder. So it's almost yeah. Yep. Mm-hmm.. A and the function of of filling an an uh an oval or an an object. I it's not possible yeah. Oh it looks like paint actually. Great. It was a privilege working with you. To private rooms? But you see the problem  y you can't continue your uh your line. Well  it's fluffy alright. Spongy. A giraffe? Right.. Leave it here. That's alright. ,The project manager opened the meeting and introduced herself to the team. The project manager introduced the upcoming project in which the team is to create a remote control. The team members participated in a tool training exercise in which they each drew their favorite animal on the white-board and discussed why they liked the animal. The project manager then talked about the project finances and discussed selling prices  profit aim  market range  and production costs. The project manager then led the team in a discussion on their experiences with remotes and what features they would like to include in the remote they are producing. The team members discussed the option of combining remotes and how to produce a remote which is capable of controlling multiple devices. 
Yep. Okay. Oh. Well we will try. Where it going? Hmm. Uh Mm. So Now save? Now uh blank? Yeah. Yeah  yeah. I'm not getting anything uh on my screen now. Okay. Wow. Oh. Nice. Uh at home we have a T_V_  a video uh recorder  a D_V_D_ player  and a satellite receiver. We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that. That's not really ea easy. So it would be nice if we have one for all. And we also had a remote control for our radio set. But um i it it had a lot of buttons on it  and you didn't know which one was what. And it was uh uh v not easy to use. So we n barely used it. Yeah. Yeah I think it uh from a marketing point of view  it also has to look nice. Or you won't sell it. And um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have. And it should work with as many uh as possible of them. Yes. Okay. Nice. An elephant. 'Kay... pop-ups. What is this  Pictionary. Uh a bird. Bird. Yeah. Whoo. Oh not. Oh. Okay. Okay. Yeah. No problem. Shit happens. A parrot. Ish. He did it before. Oh. Thank you. Uh I will start. Uh Big one  they are uh not easy to use. Um I have one set and uh a remote control  when I dropped it  uh it broke. So that won't be uh our goal  I think. And uh g big buttons  m uh that's easier to use than uh I think. Not all the small buttons  you don't know Big buttons  positive. All all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control  you won't know what they're working for. Thank you. Help also. Thank you. The weight. Not not too heavy. Not much buttons. Bust-free. That when you drop it  it won't break. Like uh some kind of rubber on it. Or hard uh hard plastic. Uh buttons not too small. Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control  sometimes it happen. Uh it between the couch and you can't find it. When you push a but a button on the T_V_  then you hear some uh some sort of bleep. And then you uh  hey there there's remote control. Next. I have one more idea. Just popped up. Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries. So you don't won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks. Okay. Thank you. Hmm. That's uh strange. Yeah. Okay. Let's try this. Uh Um. Mm-hmm. Mm. Uh No  no. Yeah. Okay. Uh blank. No. Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set. And that it controls the channels and the the volume. And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote. So that you know it s it still has batteries on it in it. And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light  and uh and you see that it's working. And uh yeah. Uh Yeah  but No no no. But I my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah well that's that are good ideas. Uh Yeah well the LED on the corner  that that indicates that it's working. If you push a button. Um Yeah. And looking on the budget  not too expensive uh material. So probably plastic or something. Uh Mm no. Yes. So welcome. The first kick-off meeting. What shall we do? First the opening  then the rest. What are we going to do. We m have to make a new remote control. It has to be original  trendy and user-friendly. So we will get back th on that. First we have to make a functional design. After that we have to make a conceptual design  and then after that a detailed design. So we'll discuss that later. First we have a look at. So first to we have to make a small painting. What have do we have to do. First you can save the documents. We have to do that every time we make something. You can print it. No. And we have to use the pen and the eraser. So Now. We all have to use this one. You have to make your own favourite animal. So I'll make an example. First don't touch that things. You can use the pen. And then you can make um something. Um you can change some things. Um format  line  and change it. And you can change the colour. So that's it. So So and after it you have to save it. Now we can make a new one. You have to paint now. So you're next. What is going on? What are you What?. Um Is a It is a It is a A duck. Yes. Hmm. Blank  yes. Okay next one. Oh. Very good. Okay. Very good. So um you can always go back. So That's it. So that was two. Now next. The budget. The b Uh we will sell the t at twenty five Euros. And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it. So now we have to think about what we will make. First I wanna hear from you. Uh what are your experiences with remote controls. So F first. Is this positive or negative  that uh big buttons? Positive. Okay. What are your experiences? Mm. So and do they always have that? It's easy to you. Okay. 'Kay. Okay so they have too much. So next. For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it. So what ideas do you have for it  for the new remote control? What what does it have to have? Not too heavy. Yes. Yeah. Yes. Like a phone. Okay. So  that's. Okay. Yes. Okay. This is It has to be compatible with other things. Okay. Yes? No battery use. So more ideas? No okay. It's only the first ideas. So uh what are we going to do now is Next meeting is in half an h hour. Uh Okay. Next meeting  half an hour. Um  what you have to do. Well look on your. And Next instructions you'll get in your email. So This is the first meeting. See you later in half an hour. ,The project manager opened the meeting and went over the agenda. The user interface designer and the industrial designer presented their prototype design  describing the shape and layout of the remote. The group discussed colour options and decided to make the standard remote in fruity colours  but with the option of buying different exchangeable covers which might appeal more to older buyers. The marketing expert led the prototype evaluation and the group were happy with their product. The group calculated the production costs. The group were 4 euros over budget  so they decided to make the case single-curved and not to use kinetic energy. The project manager led the evaluation of the project process. The group felt that only the industrial designer and the user interface designer were able to be creative and work as a team. It was felt that the first meeting was disorganised because of poor leadership but the leadership improved in the later meetings. The group were also had problems with the digital pens. The group helped the project manager fill in the final report before the close of the meeting. 
Okay  welcome to the detailed design meeting. Again  I'm gonna take minutes. Oh  we're gonna have a prototype presentation first. Uh  who's gonna give the prototype presentation? You two guys? Okay. Go ahead. Oh no  the the the mute button misses now. Do y do you did we want to have a m mute button? Huh. Wait  there's was one thing I wanted to ask. Uh  there are different ways for remote controls to uh do uh like uh d I call it teens and twenties. Uh  y th th th the two numbers. Yeah  but do we have do we need extra buttons  for example some uh some have to Yeah  but you don't you don't actually need them  becau b l a lot of remote controls work that y when y that you when you fir you push the one first  then you have a couple of seconds No  I don't think so. Nah  I don't think so really  because you have a I know some remote controls that don't have these buttons  but you still can  know  obviously you can still select the twenty uh a number in the twenty or in the ten. No  I think uh I really think it's n because you can when when you put a button on it with like one and uh then a dash  it's the same thing as when you just push the one  because it i it first gives you the functionality of that that uh separate button you also had to uh apply. Yeah  because that's i it's for television. It's exact the same thing. No  listen listen. When you push the button  the remote control gives a signal. I in th in the first place it gives a signal which it would also send when you put a separate button on it. The one with dash  that signal gi and when y whe when you don't push another button on the remote control within five seconds  then the remote control gives a signal for channel one. I think it works that way  really. Yeah  but it's exact the same that w would appear when you put a separate button push a separate button. Yeah  but you don't underst uh you don't understand my point. I think it's exact the same thing when y No  but then they would a would also support that button  because it's the same thing. Listen  with that that's that special but button you're talking about  eh? That's just a signal to recei ju they send a t signal to the v tv T_V_ that they have to put a one in on your screen and a dash  which you can pu so you can uh still put another number on it. When you don't have that separate button  and you push y one  it's exactly the same thing. Do y you the remote control gives that same signal as it would give when you only had Yeah. But you give the input. You push the one. That's the same thing as the button with the one and it yes it it is. Think about it. And it's the same thing what happens and a g remote control gives another signal after five seconds that is just one. Yeah  that's true. Yeah  but I m uh but it's I I know for sure that some televisions that w th th the remote control supplied  only ha has the c these buttons with a one and a dash and a two and a dash  but when you use a bu a n remote control that doesn't sport these buttons  it still works. But okay  we we'll impl No  we'll apply them then for now. Yeah  app just apply them next to the zero  the one and the two. Yeah  I think so. Yeah  for now  if we don't know for sure whether Yeah but okay. What I said about uh the remote control sending another signal  that that might not be true  but I still think i it it all T_V_s in some ways support it  I don't know. I think it's more c is m maybe we don't uh we both don't really understand how it i how it really works  but I think there's more to in than wha than what you just said. I do think that uh m T_V_s support mur multiple kind of remote controls. M Th won't work wi with uh to have that special button. Okay  well we'll see. But Well let's ha let's talk about the docking station later  because uh maybe we have we have to uh consider the docking station anyway  because we have some uh cost issues still to come. But we have to look n I don't know. Yeah. Okay. Yes. That's it? I think added lights are gonna be a problem too. Okay. For now  uh this is uh is good enough. Yeah  what was uh on the Okay  but in the oh yeah  the colour  because we're gonna use uh one colour for the the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber  isn't it? Then we're gonna do the buttons in the i are we're gonna have rubber buttons. And they're be a they'll be in the same colour as the rubber on the side. Okay. And I think we should use a a darker colour for the um plastic  and maybe some more m brighter and flashy stuff Yeah  we'll talk about the lights later. 'Cause I also don yeah  it's depends on the costs and such. But uh  and we have to agree uh upon the exact colours  but may I dunno if that's important  but we'll talk about that later. Okay  for now this is this is okay. Um  the next p y you gonna give a presentation too? Uh  I have to see the agenda. Detail design. Evaluation criteria. Okay. Okay. Yeah  I think four maybe would be appropriate  because it's Yeah  maybe it really depends on taste. Uh  I mean it's kind of  our design. It's so if maybe a lot of people find it really ugly  you know  o other people find it really cool. I don't know or uh I don't know how you Casting. Yeah. Yeah  but we d we didn't we're we're not planning to use fronts  I believe. With a colour a co a colours. Oh  okay. Okay  but Oh  maybe we should do three or something that w you know  our Yeah. Uh  I was thinking about four  so I think three is uh Yeah well  let that let's make that a one. That's one thing for sure. Yeah  two or a one  I guess. It's something we really put work into. Yeah. But Well maybe a two  because of the menu button or something. And telete Yeah  we don't know if the uh they're necessary. I think a two. Came a long way  but not we didn't not uh No  w w it can also always be more simplistic  but two is yeah. Yeah  uh a t I think a two. Yeah yeah  y i it's hard to say from this picture. But I do think it's more But I do think that it's more trendy than beautiful. So so I think maybe it has to score higher uh on this than on the A th a three. I i uh when you compare to the Uh uh what's the difference with Okay. No. Yeah  but we uh you mean the rubber stuff? Yeah  but we have t we have to talk about the lights uh. And I don't u also it's also really not innovative  it's more No  six. Or seven maybe  yeah. Or six. Yeah  mine is seven. Uh it's uh depends on the on the maybe No  I think I think actually it's a seven maybe  but there's nothing innovative about it. N no no  t. Yeah  I mean the dock station  but but uh  I think the the docking station  it's gonna be a kind of a problem. But Well  let's leave it open for uh for us later to see what  because we have to reevaluate anyway. Well I i yeah. No? Okay  for now it's a six or a seven uh  sev six maybe  because Yeah  but I don't I don't know if it's very inno yeah. Yeah  v Yeah  more through uh like function T_V_ functionalities and no no  you know what I mean. You have must be innovative technology for remote controls  but more in how you control stuff  not in how you find your yeah. Yeah  it's that's that's think about it la later on and uh Yeah  as a a one or a two ma uh at least. Yeah  it's good. No  I would have seen that one before. Oh  you skipped one uh Uh  here. Remote control will be bought by Yeah. Definitely. Well Uh  just in general. Yeah  a two. Yeah  but I think I think two. Uh  that is not the question. It's just w it will be bought by people under forty. Yeah  you can yeah  you can be very picky about it. Ah yeah  just make it we'll make it a two. Oh no. Yeah. Yeah  you have make an slogan is quite obvious. Oh the oh sorry  no  not not the slogan. Yeah  you can put that on the side if if we would like to. Yeah  and I will I th still think it's gonna be a two or a three. Maybe a three this time. And uh Uh  it's a one or a two. Yeah  make it a two. It's not that bad. Yeah  and that's mostly the inno when we uh score higher on innovative technology  we would score two  which is uh quite a great score. Okay. Uh  this is was uh the evaluation? Because I I still think that the most important part of this meeting still has Yeah. Still opened or uh Yeah. Okay  finance. Because um I received uh a spreadsheet. Yeah  but I uh actually don't need this presentation  I guess. Oh. I'm gonna open the spreadsheet and we're gonna work this out together  because I didn't really fin uh I have a. Didn't really finish it. Well  we uh We'll see. We'll stumble upon some problems. I probably have already opened it here. try it again. First of all  the mm all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list. But let's let's st start with beginning. We include one battery. I i uh I'll explain its Uh  the the components are listed over here. Uh  price is given. We um yeah  we we uh indicate the amount of components of the specif specific component  how much we need of them. And then uh  we'll uh calcula Don't watch the number yet. I don't know if it's filled in properly. Okay  we need one battery. One battery. I think one battery is enough. We don't need kinetic  solar cells  hand dynamo. A s okay  this this is a p first problem. Uh  I think we should know how many simple chips  regular chips Okay. But Where did we find this information? Was it I think it was uh your job in the first uh meet Uh  f your first presentation to make this clear  but then you had some t time problems. But do you th you do you know what chip we need? Maybe you can uh look it up right now. Okay  but okay. When we don't when we leave the uh retriever and such aside  what then it would be a simple chip. And with the retriever  it would be an advanced chip. Okay. Yeah  but it will it will it will be cause a lot of problems. The sample sensor sample speaker. What is it m is that the speaker we were t I don't know what it is. Okay  we went for the double-curved case made out of plastic and rubber. And with a special colour. I guess that's what we were Yeah  I don't know about the special colour  but I think w uh Yeah  I think we uh we have special colours. Okay  then the push-button  I was just counting them. Uh  I think you have to indicate the amount of push-buttons we want to use  isn't it? Well that's bit of a problem  because I re but I really don't understand that  because I can imagine a remote control with far more push-buttons  and it wouldn't be possible according to this uh sheet. Yeah. Ah. Yeah  it wouldn't Fill in the number of components you plan to use in the and the total cost I don't know. I And I count them like this. One two three uh four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and thirteen. Because Oh  this is oh  this is one  okay. Twelve  okay  then it would be eighteen  because uh  I uh rated them as uh um as uh uh uh separate buttons. Yes. And plus these two  f uh plus the mute button  and it's will be uh eighteen. Yeah  I don't understand. Y I do I don't get the point  because it's would be s relatively so expensive  just these m small buttons. Well  okay  well well let's make it just one. Here  now it's now it's already s shall we just give our own interpretation to  because else we would really have a problem. It would be impossible to make it And and less buttons than this isn't possible. This is the most simple yeah  it is possible  but I've never seen one before. Yeah  without the numbers. That's possible. Yeah  we could skip the numbers. Then uh  teletext would also be im impossible. Okay  we'll we'll just okay. But then still  when we there's no room for a docking station or something. Tha w Le let's see th we have uh oh yeah  button supplements. We'll give the buttons special colour. We'll give them a special form. Uh  I think we should mark the special form thing  because it this will be some special forms incorporated in these big buttons  I guess. Because the buttons will be uh d will be matching colour between the buttons and the rubber surroundings. I think that's the what they mean by a special colour. I think all the special colour things have to be marked over here  because that's what we were planning to do  making it Yeah  special material r also  because i has rubber. And the buttons have to be rubber. 'Kay  but the problem now is that the There's no such thing as a docking station in this list  but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents. Separately. Yeah  yeah. Yeah  but I do like the idea  but we yeah. It uh but it then the docking station isn't relevant for this project anymore  but we can but then you still have to use we have to find out what chip we u need. I think we can agree on this. I I think the special colour thing has to be uh marked. 'Cause I think we uh Yeah  I think that's what what what they uh mean But can we find out uh about uh this chips? Because when we don't need a d a docking station  then probably we also have only we also need a simple chip. And maybe then we can do something extra. Oh  n uh oh  still oh  it's gonna get more expensive with. Two. Then we have some money left. We can put then We can put a scroll-wheel on it or something. Yeah  well who knows. Or a little bit of tin titanium. Yeah  or we can ki do the kinetic cells. That's also maybe an idea. Yeah that's what then what he has to find out. Maybe you can uh find it in your email right now  then we know then we exactly know what it will cost us. Maybe is that that's nice to know. Yeah  bu bu but when we yeah  but when we skip when we um when we don't use the do we're not gonna make the docking station  then we still yeah  we need something else maybe to make it kind of special  because that was our our special feature. Yeah  okay  you can also do that  but maybe It still is a special remote control cons uh you know  wi its form is special and material. Yeah  but for two Euros  then we have still maybe we have to use the advanced chip  then two Euros isn't even possible. Yeah  then because then we'd thirty cents left. Yeah  but yeah  I don't know  because maybe d uh yeah  we have to find out with the simple chip. Yeah  and w and and we uh need f and what is this? Sample sensor sample speaker. You can look at it for s presentation. S technical functions? Oh. Oh  oh oh. Hey. Oh. Mm. I don't think here it's in here already. It's nothing about s yeah. No. But i in the presentation of yours  there was also something about different components. Which one was it? Functional requirements? Ah. Ah yes  it was the second one. Yeah  it was your second your first presentation. Sorry? Uh  this is n this is not this n that's not the right one. I don't oh. No  this is the other one. Or maybe something is uh maybe there's something abo in in these Here. You know that a push-button requires a simple chip  but a scroll-wheel  it it me requires Okay  so we only need a simple chip. No no  that's just a simple chip. A scroll-wheel it s uh only states that a scroll-wheel requires a regular chip  and that a display requires an advanced chip. So  we don't need any of them. And what's the sample sensor slash sample speaker? Okay. Back to the costs. So we're gonna use the simple chip. Nah  there is some money left to be spent. Okay  but what we have to think about now is that is is it still a special remote control? But I mean it isn't it hasn't got any innovative technology  we aren't gonna apply any uh innovated innovative te technology anyway  I think. I don't I don't see any possibility to do so  because it would wouldn't fit our defi design philosophy. But what w is there some extra maybe I think maybe the kinetic thing is something. Instead of the rechargeable the rechargeable thing was something to um know  so y so people wouldn't have to worry about their batteries anymore. Maybe we if we put the kinetic thing in it Yeah  you leave the p yeah  I know  but still I they will think about that. I mean if you u The uh it's made for s people well  the they don't if it was uh uh r useless technology  they wouldn't put it uh as a possibility. And i it it th th the the target the target uh group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as a matter of speaking. Because I think it when when there w was a remote control where it was useful to have a kinetic uh uh power source  then it would be this one. Because it's one it gets thrown around thrown around a lot and it gets used a lot Hey that maybe that's cool that's a cool thing about it  you know. You don't use batteries. I've never seen it before in a remote control. No  we we we can't make a docking station anyway. Yeah  we can als or uh also m we we can make one we can still make Yeah  but be serious  then uh the docking station will be a fifth of the price of the remote control. Yeah  but we uh we don't inc we haven't looked at the these costs of the speaker and other stuff. I don't think it's realistic for you to do so. Oh  because we We well look at all the special stuff we have. Colour a the colours are special  the form is special. It th this is whole concept. Uh maybe it with the kinetic thing  I think we could do uh do a compromise uh with the kim kinetic thing. Uh  no. Yeah  I don my suggestion is to just forget about the whole docking station thing and make it uh like a Uh uh I I I I still fee I also feel this concept of making it kinetic  because of the you know  it g it gives something dynamic to the remote control. No  that wouldn't n no. Yeah  and it is also not a good it's not you have to really do it only kinetic  you don't want it to think about batteries anymore. No no. Yeah  it's great. No no no. No no  this is very sophisticated technology technology. When you use it your remote like once a day  or maybe even less i i it It We can make it yeah no. Becau be but a remote control gets why do they state that this technology can be used if it Yeah  m but a w uh uh n uh a calculator also works on r on solar cells. Because I think the d whole dynamic part  do you know  appeals to me qui uh thinking of our design philosophy  you know  with the rubber parts and uh sturdiness of the thing  and y when you move it around a lot  then people find the idea funny that when I move my remote control around and Yeah  but you don't have to. Trust me. The idea of this technology is that you don't think about it  it just happens. Okay  then we d Okay  well y we don't have to do it  but what that would just have a lack of key features  you know. You m have to put something on your box. You have to make people buy it and uh We can really can do the docking thing  uh it's not yeah  uh we can do it  but it's would be a easy way out. Okay  but we have to grou to agree upon something  because uh we only have a minute left or so. No no  it's not possible. Okay  w b we can s we can leave it on be well then then th it's this is then then our concept is ready. Yeah  we make some extra profit of it. Huh  any ideas? No no uh there's still there's still someth concept and something special left. I mean we're gonna it's gonna excel in in on in the the range in the field of design and and uh looks and feel. That's what it's makes it special. Yeah  and I would li I would have liked a kinetic part as well  to give it some just to give it some extra special feature  and uh I know it will work  but uh it's it's an They're they're not putting technologies on this  but if it if it was impossible to to make it happen. Okay  well we leave it like this. Then it's c then we're yeah. Okay  project e uh well  we were gonna what look take a look at the last sheet. Yeah  we have to Yeah  it's Uh  I don't know. . Alright  I Yeah. Alright  and uh you gotta point out which is the volume um uh button and which is the programme button. Yeah  but you you gotta make it clear on the on Yeah  and a and a triangle on that. Yes. Next to that I kinda miss a zero actually. All n no  that's um kinda dependent on the television. I think Yeah  I think you should add A cross  or whatever. Yeah  line. No  that's dependent on the television. I do know so. Yeah. Yes  but uh uh no uh remote control nowadays are um they come with the television. Or actually  the other way around. But Yeah. Yeah  well but su If No no no. So some television respond differently. Look  if uh i i Yes. Yes  that's true. No No  it it it works uh if you haven't got uh a special button for it  uh if you push a one  then on your television there will appear a one and a a line  which is an empty space. Yep. True. No  s some some televisions need the input first uh and and you c No  that's not true. It's simply not true. It's simply not true. Uh No  remote control doesn't give signal after five seconds. Remote control is a stupid thing. If you push a button  it sends it immediately to to the television. No  definitely not. Definitely not. Yes. Uh  you can access that uh via zero  and then minus  I guess. Yeah. Yep. Okay. I kinda miss the docking station. No nothing really trendy about it. The button. Yep. I think that's very difficult  because of different shapes of uh uh devices. Yeah  of course. Mm-hmm. Well it it got it it has got to fit into the shape  of course. The technology and the voltage can be the same. That's uh that's true. But uh i if you all make the m having a bottom like this  then they all fit. Yeah  that's true  but uh Yes  but uh I I g Shouldn't it fall then? It isn't going to fall down? That's a bit uh yeah  I think No  but if if like this  I'll I'll point it out  if you got uh a a a base a base like this  I won't draw it really. If you got a base which is uh as big as this Yeah sure  but if you got if you got a tiny player  it can Yeah. Uh  wha what you could do if you uh from the bottom oh  right  help. Uh  you could make like a hole in it  you know  of uh in in the Yeah. That i that is possible  yep. Yeah  sure  you're right. Oh. I don't like the colours. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Alright. The light. Okay. And other lights? No  o on the on the front. Yeah  okay. Maybe the uh the logo. Yeah  why not? Of course. Okay. Uh  in the same colour as the side. Yeah  I think I think that'll be good. Yes. Yep. Yeah. We will. Well  uh yeah  I I'm gonna do something right there  yeah. We gotta do that on the right the most right-most screen  because the leftmost Yep  that's me. Alright. I will be needing that image  so leave it please. Um Go away. Right  we're gonna evaluate that design according to a few points. Um  we g the four of us are going to do that um together. I wanna have a colour over here  come on. Right  the remote is not ugly  a bit weird sentence  but the positive things has to be on the left  so I said not ugly instead of ugly. Uh  what would you say  we we gotta give points to uh to all of these to evaluate uh that design  and please forget the drawing skills of these guys. The remote control is not ugly. How do you feel? Yes. Background colour. How do you guys feel? The different designs. Yes. Okay. No  not not fronts  but different designs. And that's still uh uh  yeah  is is uh is a little personal touch  I guess. What? Yeah  wha wha what would you uh guys uh think? Personally. Personally. Yes  but what is it? Guido? Two or three. I was I was thinking about three  so I guess three is uh a bit uh oh  what am I doing? I'll mark it. The remote control's uh uh that n makes uh zapping easy. Yeah? Antek  you agree? Yeah. You're not Antek. I totally agree. The remote control the remote control's relevant buttons are prominently visible. Yeah  I yeah. I would say a one because uh every button is uh uh relevant. And our oh yeah  it's a b yeah. Yeah? Alright. That's a one? You agree? The remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons. I think we totally succeeded there. Oh Yeah  that's true. That's true. the the yeah  m well  you d you've got a point. Two or three? Two? Antek. Nay that that that's true  that's true. They're definitely needed. So we put it on a two? The remote control has got a really trendy look. Maarten. Yeah. Ever  yeah. Guido. Yeah  uh I agree. I agree. I was planning to give it a two  uh where I give the not ugly uh oh  yeah  that's true. You agree on the two? Great. Remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons. Uh  I copied that one. Well  uh forget that. Um Go away. Remote control has got innovative technology implanted. Yeah  and the light. Well  I g It's not seven? Why uh why not a seven? How? Yeah  you think the lights are innovative? Well  it's n true. Uh  I agree  m but I'll Yeah  you you didn't draw the docking station. Yeah  it it's I think I think with its I think more m Uh that that's n No uh  well  the agenda says evaluate now  so I think we It's it's a six. That m f Yeah  for the retrieval function. Yeah. I think that's very innovative for a remote control. Yeah sure  but But I d I definitely don't think it's a five  but Remote control is easy to use. I think a two. Yeah? Come on. The remote control hasn't got uh. I've just filled uh Go away. I found twelve questions so much  but it still is ten. It will be bought by people under the age of forty. No no no. No  just if they if they buy it. Yeah  what do you think? Antek? No  that's no comparison. And I don't mean two people. W w Right  the rem The remote control has recognisable corporate image  colour  logo or slogan. Oh  the slogan. Can we see the slogan? Are we gonna do that? Three? I agree. Because of the slogan Remote control's got a basic design intended uh for novice users. Two? Two. Alright. We gotta add up the scores now to see our total average. Four  five  seven  nine. Forget that. Fifteen  seventeen  twenty one  twenty four  twenty six. Twenty six. It's a two point six. Alright  we yeah. Yeah. True. This was my evaluation. So We did a pretty nice job until now. Um  is this your Whatever. Well  I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire. Yeah. A five. A five. Doesn't matter. We probably will. The amount  yeah. I don't know I haven't got an idea on on which we need to use  really. Yeah. Yeah. And how do you know? I mean  you got that email. Did it point out what to use them for? Alright  well  point out the advanced chip for now  I guess. I don't know. I don't know if it's very special. Alright  that's okay. No. I don't think so  because it says amount. The the the yellow row is the amount of To n that's total of four buttons. I think that Eighteen. One two three four five  si Fifty cents for one single stupid button. Yeah  exactly. Yeah. I can't I I I couldn't understand it if it was fifty cents per uh uh per button. Really. Yeah  yeah  No  really. Yeah  but I d I wouldn't want to own that. Really. Yeah. I don't think the special form is really true. Is it? Yeah  I dunno. Plastic. No. Yeah  I really don't get it. I mean if it's a simple chip  then we suddenly got two Euros and thirty cents. Yeah  yep. I think so  too. Oh  I don't know. Uh why? I mean i i if you if it would cost two Euros  that had a total a total thing  it would be nice too  I mean uh we're not gonna add uh a trip to Hawaii to it. I like the hand dynamo part. We can make a plain docking station for two Euros. I mean Wi wi without recharge Yeah  but but we can make a docking station for two Euros uh if you don't put the recharge function in it. I mean  it has a shape. Of course it has a shape  but i i Why should that not be possible? No  for for the uh for the docking station if you do if you choose the simple chip. Yes. Dead. Reanimate it. What the hell are these? Oh  whatever. This isn't helpful. No  that was my presentation. It's already open. It's at the bottom. It's uh at your task bar. Oh. Sorry. Okay  sorry. Yeah  nice. I it doesn't say anything. That's not needed. A display uh is  of course  uh for showing letters. For showing text. I don't think that uh just a l a little light Yeah  I agree. Yeah  I guess so too. Next channel. No. Well  we might want it  but Yeah. Great. Delete. Yeah. Well  there're three  I guess. I think we can make a docking station. Yeah. No  that's true. M bu Or the hand dynamo dynamo Yeah. Yeah  but but if we ca I don't know if Five minutes. That's not true. We can make a docking station for two thirty. Two thirty. We can make a docking station. Sure. Sure. The power device is is i i is very cheap. That's just a regular uh power cable and whatever. So. Yeah. Well then it's a useless project. Can't we uh Can't we say fifteen Euros? No  sta yeah I mean No. You can sell for twenty seven and a half. Then you make as much profit as you would with twelve and a half production costs. I don't think No. Thirteen twenty. And I think only Yeah  but only kinetic  then you gotta You you gotta throw uh throw it through the room like twenty times an hour  really. No. Yeah  it's funny for a week. I guess something like that  where you have to move it around very frequently  is demotivating. No  I I don't move my uh my remote control very much  seriously. Well  we've got more than fifty Cents. Yeah. No  we won't  but that's um something else. No  this not gonna sell. No. Of course not. We come back tomorrow  okay? We can't do anything else. Warning  finish meeting now. Yeah  sure. No  we can't. Yes  yes. Celebration. I don't see why  but I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire  to be honest. No  not yet. Alright  I'll see you guys in a minute. I don't think so. I don't know. I don't I don't think so. Yes. 'Kay  we've made a prototype. Um  we've got uh uh our aspects from the last meeting. Uh  especially we looked at the form  material and the colour. Um  we've uh drawn here the p prototype. The logo is uh is uh is pretty uh obvious to see on the on the remote control  but it is necessary when you want to build your uh company f to a level higher. Um  our interface elements  there are shown in the in the drawing. Maybe you can uh point them uh The functions. But uh that It's uh here then  in the middle. Yes  um we've disc Most of the users Yes  y there there will be a p a little a little P_ on that and a little uh yeah. Yes. It's a television. Yes. Yes  yes  you have you have a lot of standard buttons that has to be uh on it  uh th with the one and a double uh uh yes. Yes  you have televisions  then you have to  you know  you have to uh press Yes  but but a lot uh Yes  but some televisions don't accept uh that that No  no  but s Yes  but some some old televisions uh you have to uh click on uh a special button  uh then you go to a a next level  you can push two buttons. You want Yes  but some television don't support it. No  a remote can Yes  so they need no  they need No  but uh Yeah  it And the button for the SCART uh audio video uh external input. No  no. Uh  remote control sends one signal at one button uh press. Uh  some N some televisions when when you want to go further than uh ten No  you have to you have to uh give the television uh two or more signals. When you uh press one button  you give one signal. And the older televisions need more signals to go a level higher. But When you make the technology that that it will uh give more signals  it could work  but Just a basic idea of of of the most uh most y most common uh and simple uh operations on the remote. Yes. It's here on the We came uh Yes. But maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station uh uh a bit standard for for uh the other products we sell  because Real Real Reaction sells more products than only remote controls. So maybe we can uh use the docking station  for example  uh M_P_ three players or or uh uh hearing devices. Yes  but when you put that same volt voltages on it  you can put uh when the when the when uh o the the the lowest part of it  when it's o the same as the other products  you can put it all on the same uh Yes  but we can make No  we can make uh make the most lowest part all the same. When when the the recharger has a has a bit what points out  we can place all on top of it. Just have to be big enough for the biggest No  when you make it large enough no it it will not. But then it's a little bit But it's just an idea. But it's flat it's flat as as this  so we can p make all the products as flat as this. Yes  but when you make uh uh a bit of big Yes  little holer littler Uh  little products go deeper in it. Yes. And uh uh the f the look and feel would be great on this uh remote control  because uh you always uh will uh pick up the remote control in the in the smallest uh area. Then your uh left thumb of uh your right thumb is uh near the programme uh button  which is the most common used uh function  and all the other buttons are available for your uh thumb. So it's it's it's really good design. Yes  uh on the side uh there will be a strip of rubber  and in the middle uh there is uh a hard uh a hard material  a bit hard plastic with a light uh behind it. Yes  we can make also n neon lights on it  or or the buttons that can make uh light on it. Yes. But  it will also uh uh use batteries  and do we want to The all the aspects of the interface buttons were uh Yes. Yes. Yes  maybe we can use on the on the lights on the side we can use uh uh multiple uh lights  so it will uh Yes. No. Yeah. I think I think the the fronts will give it a more uh uh uh less uglier uh side  because you can uh make it in your own yes  you can make it in your own uh more to your own personality or or house style. Yes. Or forty. I think two or three. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. It's all about the buttons. Also  the the the buttons of the one  the two  the the digits  o they're used uh uh Can yes  three  two. But you can't make a remote control without them  because Yes. Yes. A one. We we've tried to make it uh the the best trendy look uh ever. Yes. Yes. No. No  not L_C_D_  so. But that that's not innovative. Lights lights are Six. Because we've tried to make it a little bit innovative  but it but it With the lights it it's it's kind of future But still you can retrieve it when it's when it's gone  with the with Yes. The docking station is a is a little bit innovative. It's a part of the remote. And with the speaker on the there's also a speaker. Okay. But the retrieval or the Yes  how would you innovate a remote control more? To put it on your head. Yes. Yes. You like the buttons. Yes. In in and comparing with uh people of th of the age above? We don't know. But Yes  two  but only in c when you compare it with with elderly. This is just guessing. Make it a two. When it succeeds  uh it can get a two  mu A logo. Yes  uh encrypted uh with Yes. Yes. Is there something after this uh meeting? Or Okay. Yes. Uh it's it's one one chip  but but you have to choose one from it. The simple chip is e enough I I think  but with the lights with the lights and the retrieval  it can be uh No  uh I Yes  my my my uh The the email I got said uh simple chip  but when we put in the speaker and the retriever uh device  it will uh cost a a bit more  like I think the advanced chip maybe. Bec No  the they didn't know about a retriever or a speaker uh in it. Then it's a simple chip. Yes  I I I s I That will be enough for future uh recommendations. I don't know it uh either. Yes. Otherwise  you get uh a standard uh plastic colour. Standard rubber. St Yes. No  it's only uh when you use push-buttons  it will cost that much. If you use a scroll-wheel Maybe it's the kind of push-buttons. You can have f four kind of push-buttons. Rubber. You can have uh Different  yes. Why is that so uh expensive. So  whe when you so then it It's eighty percent of the price of the of the amount of When you have the same amount of button  you have to put in wi in your carton. Board. And then throw it But whe I've seen one uh one remote control with only the pu yeah  only with uh page up  page down and volume  but but Uh  it's it's still for little children. They can handle that remote control  but but it isn't fo Yes  it's for it's li uh it's just for a little Otherwise  it Otherwise it would be the Special form also  it says. What is the normal material? Sh yeah. Classic? Oh  plastic. But we can uh sell the remote control and uh sell the docking station yes. And and but we don't have to tell it  but what we can say of can um almost make it impossible to buy a remote control without the docking station. No  but you otherwise you can't retrieve it. But for two Euros and thirty cents  we uh we don't get a docking station. For For two Euros. It isn't in my information  so I don't know it uh either. It isn't in my information  I uh I I've got a schematic view of the remote control  but nothing about uh advanced chips or Uh I've got here in uh I will put a I will put a page on it. When my mouse works again. My mouse is uh Yes. Oh. Ah  I've got it. I will put uh my email on the the network. It's on it. Yes. Um Yes  that was mine. But that was my second Mm But this is the same uh This is o only the possibilities. Yeah. We can use a simple  a regular  or advanced chip. Ah  okay. With the light. L_C_D_. Maybe you can say against the remote uh page uh f uh page up  page down. All in twelve Euros. Twelve Euros and fifty cents. And the lights. Where uh are the lights? But but sometimes you put a Kinetics aren't uh nowadays only used in watches and that's because you're always walking. Uh solar cells are useless. Fo for a docking station. With a cable  with uh buttons on it  with retrieval uh device in it. Wi with a button to wi with a button to retrieve it  so it will beep. Uh  so it's uh wireless technology. Look at the case  the case the case of of uh of uh No  then we have to sell it for thirty Euros. It's the Maybe we can uh can do it both. Maybe we can do it both uh in the in the in the remote. Battery and kinetic. Yes  but when it's then when it then you have to shake it uh and all when it's when it's empty. You asked for three d No  that's n that's not true. Uh  a watch is uh kinetic because you walk all the time. Yes  solar cells are also stated. Why don't we use solar cells then? That's true. Oui. You can do it for fifty cents. The c The case the case alone is is is uh the case alone for uh remote control is at least one Euro. Then we have one Euro thirty for the whole docking station. But now Great. It's great. Our remote control. Yes. Seventy Euros. Why not a hand dynamo then? We're done. Is this it? Okay. Yes. Where's the champagne? I don't uh hear a bell. Bye. Uh-huh. Just fill that one in. . coffee. Uh  well the uh all the functions are discussed uh I think the most of the functions are uh uh obvious. Uh  it's a little bit. Uh  power button. Uh then the the the nine uh channels. Uh the volume uh uh at the side  and the other side is the programmes. And then we had uh just uh two buttons  we place them in the middle  uh the menu  and for the teletext I thought that was th Oh  the mute button. Yeah. Well  yeah mo uh mo Yeah  well most of them are right-handed. Yeah well  I don't have time in uh anymore on the Oh yeah  just progr programme above  I think. Yeah  true  yeah. Uh Uh I think so. Zero? May maybe here? Yeah. And then a second. Is it depending on television? Yeah. True. But the ex Yeah. You uh you can wai when you push the one you can show on the telly a one and just a dash  and then wait uh two uh seconds or something We'll discuss them in the usability lab. Uh eva evaluation. I don't know uh I don't know if if it's it's necessary. Yeah? Okay. Ach. Yeah. Yeah. Well it yeah  uh there's nothing I think it's pretty basic  the the there's no fu there's one there's one button  that's wha there's there's there's one function and that's n the one button when you want to find it. You can. But i i i it's backwards. But it's it's backwards. It's leaning. It's leaning backwards  I think  in the in the docking station. That's text. lights? Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. No  not fronts. Different designs. Different colours maybe  yeah. We can make it a one. Mm yeah. I agree. Um  I uh I go for the positive. So I go for two. Okay  three. Yeah. Two. One. One. Okay yeah  I'll I'll agree. I'm the I'm the usability  so Yeah. The Well Yeah  well menu Yeah  maybe. Yeah  true. Yeah  I agree. Mm two. Because we got Well. Yeah. Uh  I will I will make it a three  because uh yeah. I I th Yeah. True  yeah. Yeah. No. We're not well  maybe the the the on the side. And the light maybe. But Well  six. No  six. Six. Yeah. Innovative in generally or just f original for A docking station is innova Okay. Six. Yeah  a two. More two. Yes. Yeah  I think two  yeah. I agree. Two. We don't have the slogan though. The logo. Underneath it or something. A three. Three. Yeah  a three. Yeah  two. Two. No. Okay  yeah. Shoot. No. Well  special colour.. I don't Mm okay. Whoa  it's a little That's huge. No. We have the simplest buttons. Uh  one til nine. Is that one or is that nine buttons? Yeah. Is it cents  the the the fifty cents a button? No way. It's way No  no no. Yeah  uh That's still four. Yeah  that's no option  that's no option. A special colour  why a special colour? But wha what s what special? Okay  yeah. Uh  yeah. Plastic. Plastic  I think. Plastic. Yeah. Se no no no. And then we can get a docking station. But what what can we do But uh what can we do with the simple chip and what's difference with a regular chip and a advanced chip? If if i Regular chip and because we don't have uh special functions to use uh in advanced chip  for example. Yeah. We'll go back uh tomorrow. That's the question. If we do i do we need an advanced chip  or is it okay f No. No no  they were uh mine  yeah. Died. Yeah  it's open. It's circuit board. It's only just basics for for At the end circuit there is an infrared LED. Components design. Components design maybe. N on top. Working design. Yeah  but it's the the other one. Was it working design or components design? Chip set. The display requires an advanced chip. Requires. Little lights. Yeah  but that that's just the same as the the LED. Yeah. No. I think uh the uh normal uh simple chip will be okay. Yeah. Yeah  true. Well  that's not too what we want. So  simple chip is okay. Yeah  lights  yeah  there's no category. Can we do it wi within two two Euro? Mm-hmm. But it's original. But then we could make a docking station. Wow  w why no li Look at now  we got two two thirty left. Ca can't we make a docking station of that? I don't know. Well  we we uh Yeah  then we don't have any innovation things. No  we only make less profit of it. No. Cheap remote control. It w it won't tell  but No  uh  n no Yeah  we just have to go all what we did today again. You have to do it over. Yeah. the No  but no. Yeah  yeah. No. Yeah? We can do it here then. Can we can't we do it here? Yeah  we're doing now. But it's. Oh  okay. Nice. ,The group discussed their initial ideas about the features that they wanted to integrate into the design. They discussed making a universal remote with a locator function. They also discussed the shape and the number of functions in the main interface. The Project Manager instructed the Marketing Expert to examine competitors' remotes  the User Interface Designer to research possible shapes and colors  and the Industrial Designer to research possible materials and the necessary internal components of the device. 
Hmm. Mm mm mm. Is recorded? Okay? Okay so welcome everyone. So we are here for the kickoff meeting of uh the process of designing a new remote control. So I will first start with a warm welcome opening stuff  then uh we will uh see what will be uh our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it. And uh then we will uh discuss if we have few ideas and we will uh end uh by uh dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process. So sorry? You have another meeting soon? So you have to be quick. Okay. So the the goal is to have a remote control so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original  we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user-friendly. So uh the design step will be divided in three uh main points. First it will be the functional design. Third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design. So the functional design is to identify the main user needs  the technical function the remote control should fulfil. And then we will move to f conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved  what kind of user interf interface we want and what are the different uh trend in user interface and stuff like that. And then the desired devi design will consist in uh specifically implementing and detailing the choice we've uh made in the second point. So I will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to uh each of us to to draw uh your favourite animal on the white board. Do you have any idea of which animal you want to show us? Okay that's good. n n You should If you want to react uh about this wonderful drawing uh I'll let you uh comment. Okay it's an abstract drawing. I think it's nice and original. Okay. You want to draw something Christine? Of course your animal is recorded so it's not lost. Is this uh Ah okay it's pretty. Okay it's your cat. Okay. Olivier  do you want to Okay I go  but next time you'll do something I'm sure. I'm a bit short on cable. Okay. So what could I draw? Maybe I can draw like a very simplified cow. I don't know if it looks like a cow Like a what? I dunno it it looks more like a donkey in fact I would say. Okay so I hope that it helps you uh in the process of designing a remote control. Okay. Let's move on. So Here the uh financial objective of our project. That is to say to to have a production cost lower than twelve point five Euros and have a selling price of twice that price t in order to target a profe profit of uh fifty uh million Euros. Yeah if it's trendy  original I d fulfil the user needs. We have to discuss that point. On yeah you you can suggest points like this. So what what so we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple. So what's what are your ideas about that? Maybe I can have the your opinion from the marketing side? Okay  so if it selled uh by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device. Do you agree? Yeah. So maybe it should be for multiple devices. And uh do you have any ideas um of uh design ideas or any uh uh technical requirement we we should uh fulfil? Few buttons. Okay. And do you have it also to be to be lighted in order to be used in the dark? Might be a good idea. Okay. And do you have any um any uh idea of the trend the trend in domain  what it shouldn't it should look like  or things like that? With rou okay. Like for okay. Okay. So. Fit in your hand  yeah. And also it have  i it may be it may be important for the remote control to be uh To  to resist to various shocks that can happen if it fall. Water-proof as well. Maybe it is original because you can uh use it in your uh in your bath whereas the others can't. Maybe water-proof would be very original. Havin having a water-proof remote control so that the people can uh use it in their bath. That could be uh Yeah but  it is still something uh you have to buy and that is um not maybe very Yeah  mayb B But maybe we can bulk it with uh already this plastic thing and uh the waterproof uh stuff as well. Yeah. Maybe we can sell uh all that together  so so plastic protection and uh and a waterproof box as well. That might be good uh track to follow. Optional or selled with it? Yeah. Maybe we can have uh But we don't design the T_V_. Maybe we can have uh something you whistle and uh the remote control uh beep. Yeah  barks  yeah. So we can uh have a whistle uh remote control? I don't know  whistle-able? Th Whistle tracking yeah. Whistle tracking remote control. That's a good idea  that's very original and that's can uh improve. Yeah d d uh. Yeah but s still we have to mm we have to have an advantage over our competitors. I think this is a good advantage. Yeah. We have to ask Yeah. We have to ask the quest of that's uh design to the uh Industrial um Designer. Which is you. Okay so try to find that for next meeting. Okay. So next meeting is in thirty minutes or so uh. Don't pani. So so I will ask the Industrial Designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working any working function we have discussed. So then I will ask the User Interf Interface Designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons  the the fact that is lighted or not  things like that  and what would be convenient for the user. And also um I will ask the Market Expert to uh try to find out what are the absolute requirements  what is absolutely needed in a remote control uh for the user. So. And then uh I will uh just ask you to think about that and uh look at your mail because you will receive uh some good advice soon. So. Thank you I think that's all for this point. Anyway you will receive some messages. Be careful. You eat it? Does it move uh? Okay  but I don't know if it uh is still correctly uh We'll see. How do you wear this thing? Not too many cables and stuff. Original. Uh. Just one thing. Uh  you said twenty-five minutes  but I have something else to do uh  so gotta have another meeting uh soon  so maybe you could hurry up a bit It's true. I have another meeting so if you could uh Yeah. Yeah  for the lawnmower project. Okay. What an original idea. Orangutan. Can I give you the no? But I don't have to say anything. When I'm drawing the orangutan. It's an abstract drawing of an orangutan. Yes. I don't have a red colour. Usually orangutans have red hair so this is a very important but I don't have red pen  so Yes. Yes. I know. Wha what is this strange beast? Is it a monster? It's a cat? I thought these things did not exist. Ah yeah Does have a name? Caramel. Ah-ha. Next time I concentrate. He looks like a bong. Okay. Sorry. No. Scary? I I think we will be finished this uh Is it for uh for putting a for logos  no. That's I is there a matter for a new remote control? Is it uh a single device remote control or is it a multi-device remote control? Ah this is not defined at all? Ah  okay. Well uh do we sell other stuff? Uh if if we bundle the remote control with something uh to sell then it could be a single device  otherwise it could be programmable one otherwise who would buy a remote control from us. Yeah. No  I couldn I cannot fi think of any requirements right now. Mm. Something like that  least fits in your hand. Yeah. The basic requirement. Only a buck. Waterproof. Mm. B it seems uh so  but uh if you don't have an waterproof remote control it means you can just cover it with some plastic and you can sort of f And  and that's one of the that's one of the shock I mean there are people that have a remote control and they are worried that it's going to break and they put some extra plastic around it. That's people they actually do it themselves. I it will look a bulky in that case. Like as an optional thing. Barks. That's that's quite cool  but uh of course we you don't normally need uh any audio uh recording stuff on your remote control right? So i it's just going to add t to the cost. It's cool. I think I like the idea  but I'm not sure about the what you  who is giving who's giving who's giving our budget. Who's Yeah. Yeah. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. Mm. Good. Uh  so we come back in five minutes? Half an hour. Okay uh sorry. You have to imagine a little bit um. This Sorry too uh. Is it beautiful? Do you know? It's a cat. Isn't it? Yes yes is it like that. Is it better? Okay. It's my cat. Yeah. The name is Caramel. Yeah. Thank you No no n You should write y the name I think. Me Ah yeah. Yeah. Caramel. And you I think I'm too short for the cables. Quite squarey. He also. Mm. Mm-hmm. I think we shouldn't have too many b for my part. I think If we don't have so many buttons could be nice. Yeah. Something which is not squarey maybe uh  not a box. Yeah. Mm-hmm. And I think we should have a device Sorry. Yeah. directly. Yeah. And I I think we should have something  most of the time I I lose my remote control. We should have s uh special bu button on the T_V_ to make the remote control beeping. Ah yeah. Yeah. Barks. Yeah. Yeah whistle. Whistle tracking. Yeah. yeah Okay. Don't panic. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Ah. ,The project manager opened the meeting and stated the agenda. The marketing expert discussed user preferences in terms of the appearance and use of remotes  finding that users wanted fancier looking remotes  disliked losing their remotes  wanted remotes with fewer buttons  frequently use the channel changing and volume buttons  and that younger users wanted speech recognition. The user interface designer described how a remote works and how to go about designing one. He presented two remotes currently on the market and the advantages and disadvantages to each design. The industrial designer described the interior workings of a remote. The project manager briefed the team on some new requirements and led them in a discussion about their target group  the option to include speech recognition  how to find a remote when lost  and batteries. 
I keep forgetting whether I've done this.. Yep. Ta-da. Right. Mm-hmm. Um well I don't have very much to add. Um the the case oops  that's the uh on off button just come off our prototype. The the case can be either um spongy rubber or hard plastic. We're not absolutely sure about a combination of the two  but it can be either of those. We have the technology to do that. Um and as for the the actual components um  uh Steph just said this is a quite a cheap device to manufacture. We have simple rubber push buttons um which provide all the functionality we need. Um the um the diode that actually does the um infrared is at the end  it's the stalk of the banana  or it's just the thing at the end of this version. Um so that's for material. Colour  well uh Steph's the expert on colour. Um we we don't have any particular restrictions on that. Yeah  I think that's all we've got to say really. A banana. Would you care to examine the prototypes  see how they feel in the hand? Yes  that's so that your index finger automatically goes straight to it. And it was partly we thought the design looked better  but it could be moved if if marketing feel it's important to have the on off button in a different place. Hmm. And it's a very simple design  there's not a lot to wrong  the components are cheap to make. Mm-hmm. Yes  a plain  simple  clean design. Well we have got s trendy further down  but Elegant  I don't know if I'd call them elegant. Stylish  yeah. Yeah  I'd I d I don't think that's what we're aiming at with this concept. I think we're using simple components that are gonna be robust but not particularly innovative. Very. Yeah. We have the worry about how robust it will be if it's it's curved as a banana but spongy. I think yeah. Yeah. No. So that's false. No. Yeah  I think they're different  aren't they? Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Well I think our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop. We haven't got a lot of expensive components in there. I'd put it at one I think  but I dunno  what do you Yeah  true  it might be the yeah  yeah  true. True. Yeah  that's a good point. Right. Yeah. That was the crank  wind-up crank on the side. Just one. Uh uh yeah  I think we can do it all with simple Just checking that. Yeah  simple  'cause we've just got push buttons  so we can do it all with simple which is the ch should be the cheapest. Yep. Yeah  that that one is single curve  isn't it? Um do we have I I think you it means you reverse the curve. Yeah. Yeah  I do I don't think we need that for either of them  you can do a banana in single curve  yeah. Yeah  can we do some what ifs  'cause it may I mean I I still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself  but it depends on the cost  I guess. Yes. Yep. Do we need to say how many buttons  or or d is it just one? 'Kay. Uh they'll be rubber  yep. Actually  does tha does special material mean that plastic is not a special material? 'Cause I think they can be plastic. Yeah. They could be plastic  we don't have to have rubber buttons  because we haven't got a double curved case. It's just one  isn't it? What  we're in. More profit. Do you do you need to double click on that to open it? Yeah  yeah  the Play-Doh was best  I thought. Yep. Yeah. Yeah  I think we're a good team actually. I'm not sure all the wires are really great though. I thought so. Yes. Yes. Oh hang on  we haven't heard. Mm-hmm. Absolutely  and it's kept us within budget. And then we get the product launch party. Product launch party? Absolutely. Red. Agenda three. Mm. I like the fact that on both of them the keys play such a prominent role. It's really kind of a Mm-hmm mm-hmm. Yeah. But it's also like texting  you don't Yeah. It's also in terms of um being lost it's it's quite it looks quite different. You know  I I d I have several four remotes  and they all look the same until you get up close and you have to you know  this is really identifiable. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No  okay. Um shall I take your uh power? Oh. Okay. This is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation  and the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements and the hot trends introduced by the marketing department. So  this means we're going to go over the priorities that were raised by uh the consumers a as well as incorporate all of our insight into this uh evaluation exercise. So I'm going to go and use the whiteboard  and I've made a list of criteria to look at  and so I'm gonna I'm gonna leave this up as the last thing  but for the evaluation it's going to be one is true and seven is false  going over these different criteria  so one true seven false and I'm gonna now use the um the board. Okay. So um fancy  technologically innovative  easy to use  trendy  buttons  excess buttons  good buttons  ugly  sellable  and other. And in fact I hope that uh you all introduce some additional terms  because these are things that um have been brought up  some of them seem rather close  like they overlap. Mm  yeah  price. We'll put price up at the top. Um Okay  so Did you say? Uh okay  so wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I yeah  so in that respect I think we'll go with that respect. Yeah. Elegant. Yeah  no these aren't the exact terms that the um Yeah. Elegant. We're gon let's use elegant  although the the the people  the word on the street is is Yeah. N that um yeah uh the uh is fancy. So let's let's take it to the next level. Well okay  so in terms of elegant  fancy. we'll call it E_F_ um  do we do we think that perhaps and maybe we should say the yellow? Should we go with the yellow in terms of I think that's a really superior they're both Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. As a banana. I think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana. And of the two I really like I m I like the banana  but I I do like the chunk. No  but I mean in terms we have to evaluate one of them. Unless do you guys wanna evaluate both? Okay. So we say true. Um technologically innovative. Yeah. So we'll say we'll say uh false. Easy to use. One  is that inappropriate? Okay. Oh  pardon me. Um trendy  s and I say specifically spongy fruity. Okay. Okay  so two? Um are there excess buttons? That is false. Um good  well designed buttons  intuitive buttons. True. Ugly. People don't respond well to ugly. Sellable  uh quirky  you know  something people like oh  yeah. Yeah  I do too. Oh yeah. And I was I was thinking of other things um in terms of uh could we say it's cost saving? With the Yeah  with the energy. It is going to be kinetic? Yeah  we'll c we'll say it's a cost saving enviro. Uh so yes. Well you're still in the Play-Doh stage. Anything else? Including price  do you have any idea about price or other features? Okay. So true one or should I go to two or three? Okay. Um other? Anything else you guys can thing of? And I'm gonna actually change a couple of these so then I'm gonna instead of ugly I'm gonna say it's attractive and then make that true  so that 'cause I have to do an average. And then um excess buttons. Exactly. Wow we're doing really well. Yeah  be you know  so it doesn't ruin the polarity. Mm-hmm. Or L_C_D_. Yeah. Well if you g uh let me know if if any of these um if you if you all can think of any other um thing to change here if you th if you think I should change the innovative or add other features. If not I'll average those. Okay. Mm. So Um okay  how about if I uh pass this back to you and I'll uh figure out the average here. Thank you for everyone's help with that. One  two  three  four  five  six. Yeah. Sure. Yes. Yeah. Yep. I think with the marketing element of uh fruit shaped I I mean I that really opened my eyes. I I only speak for myself though. Yes. I can give you a number  um it's uh the average evaluation score is one point eight eight  so it means w you know  I can I can spell it out. There were six true or ones  four um pardon me  two s almost true or close to true  so that was four points  and then uh one false  seven points  so seventeen divided by nine we're between one and two. I would say that's ex excellent in terms of uh ho how much we adhere to the ideals of the uh market place. To maintain old technology  exactly. Yeah  yeah. Yes. Okay. Nice. So we might have to wait. Yeah. Um I one thing I want to do is oh  I think the meeting's done. Yeah. Um one thing I wa I wanna do is save everything in the right files  because I don't think everything is saved. The right files. Final meeting market Yes. Alright. Well. Yeah  well you see  each made one  we didn't have enough yellow dough. This is the one that I made. It is uh curved  easy to hold  hand-held  nice and small with big easy buttons. This is like a scroll  but they are push buttons and they enter takes you into the different menus. Of course we need someone who's experienced with the television. I mean this is the infrared thing that's gonna zap at the television. Uh I'm not quite sure how to make that  but I'm sure it will work. Uh this is on off switch  'cause I think we do need that  and I think it gives it a nice balance. And it's gonna have the logo imprinted on it uh in there. Um as for what it's actually made of well the function of these buttons is up  down  left and right in the different menus. Uh position  I presume that just means right right on it  easy to see. The main feature of it is just a simple design  simple  lack of uh buttons all over the place. Right? Form curved  kind of smooth  hand-held  makes it feel nice to hold. Uh material  I think Kate's gonna tackle that quite a bit  but I think we have two different options  because we did make a another one  which wa uh is in the shape of banana  it's just if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons  like just like this but in the shape of a banana  which is also nice and easy to hold and feels good and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology  just a slightly different design. Also with on off switch and infrared uh I had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic. So like uh well  I dunno  what's it like? I guess like an existing remote control  but molded and smooth. Whereas otherwise we'd thought  like with this one or mix and match  just we were gonna see what you thought  the uh a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons. So we have the two options we can follow  either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber  depending on cost restraints. And what we well  what conclusion we reach when we discuss it. Uh material yeah  that's what I have to say about material. Can I scroll down on there and see what else Well colour  I think I definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons  because that's the company colours  but if anybody's got any other suggestions  I'm quite willing to consider them as well. So  it just depends what you think about these ideas and if I'm yeah  maybe  Kate  you better say what you think about them. I thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme  I guess this one is obviously fruit shaped. This one has n banana  yeah. This one has no obvious connections to fruit  but because it's round and molded  it kinda makes you think sort of organic  touchy-feely  kiddie  it's more like yeah  you'd expect it to be like a child's sorta toy remote control instead of a real one  which I quite like that sort of image. 'Cause it's very big and chunky and child-friendly and Hold them  you see  you know. Curvature  is it to your liking? If you don't wanna tire out your thumbs after all. Yeah. Breaking  oh right. Well you see  that's why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it  because then it'd just be rigid. Yeah  we really like we really like that design  I mean it looks just like a logo  that arrangement of the keys. Like a c like a compass point  you know  just up  down  left and right  and we think we could make that quite a good feature. And it's like the the iPod scroll wheel  but better. Yeah. Yeah  yeah  I mean it that's what it makes me think of  mobile phones  I was try I was thinking  moving your thumb like this  what does that remind me of? It's texting. Hmm. Yeah. I mean the thing is we do need to develop our technology of I mean actually how to program the menus and what sort of  you know  text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen  but we do definitely think that it's a viable option. Uh yeah  we're finished. Yeah  what about price  is that gonna go on there as well? Price of materials. Not that we actually know anything about it  but we can we can pretend. It depends what what you mean by fancy really  'cause when I think of fancy  I think of it's got lots of extra sort of fripperies and  you know  like baroque curliness and which I'd call these quite uh minimalist  simple and plain  but I mean I do see what it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality  so in that respect it is quite fancy. I think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy  I'd say maybe aesthetic. like stylish or aesthetic. Fancy. Did you just break the pen? Well d we'll just call it fancy then. Yeah  I think we n we need to they're both yellow with black buttons  it's just that we didn't have any more dough to represent uh that  but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black. So what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two that isn't that is more curved  like a banana  but that isn't actually recognisable as a banana  you know  with the grooves and the stalk and stuff  so. So that's maybe not something we have to decide just right now  is it. Just somewhere a long the scale of in between these two. Yes. Oh yes. Well  maybe only a two or a three then  'cause it's no we still haven't decided about specific sponginess or specific Yeah  I don't really think that's gonna work  but No. No. Well it is quite it is quite quirky I think. It could be quite a good brand  like a good little object. Oh  we also need tho think about the energy. Is it the kinetic energy? If it's it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy. Yeah  but we haven't completely developed that side of it yet  so we're not completely sure about that  but yeah. Yeah. I would say maybe a two  'cause we still we need to uh get somebody in who is good with the programming for the menus and things. I mean it's not just like I mean it's not like ev you know  on a normal chunky remote every button res I mean means something different  whereas this one has only got the four buttons and they all they mean everything  depending on what menu you're in. uh we need somebody to develop that. Yeah. Just putting no excess buttons. As for see if we're technologically innovative  I'd say it is quite innovative  because there aren't really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons. I mean I know we're not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition but but we are at the upper end of the push button market. Well  just kinetic then . It's the wind-up. What does double curved mean  I don't understand. Oh no  we don't need that. No. Single-curved  I'd say. I I just wanna say plastic. It's just button. Yeah. Yeah. Well yeah  like the compass point one. Yeah  they could be plastic. Great. Yes. Yeah. And Play-Doh. Yeah well  'cause I mean it's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying  well we quite want this  but imagine it rounder. So much better just to go and  you know  this is it  this is what we want. Yeah. Spongy. And I'd never heard of the kinetic energy before  so. Good work as a design team  because we Oh yes. Yes. Yeah. And the the only false one is because we've chosen to keep a simple old technology  which if it works perfectly well I see no point in improving on if it works  so. Yeah. So we do count as I think excellent or one.. Bring on the ice sculptures. Yeah. That's what I said  ice sculptures. Is that the end of the meeting? Um almost  there's one more thing I have to get out of the I have to make sure that this attachment will open. Ah-ha. Okay. We'll open that when the time is right. In the meantime Closing things down  okay. Let's see what this thing does. Does it come up together or disappear one of them or what? Ah  we came up together  we're good. Okay. Are we ready to start? Okay. It's now quarter of four. This is a f another forty minute one so it will end at four twenty five. Okay. Right. Our agenda is  as before  for me to open the meeting  for us to go over the previous minutes  then for the two of you to present your prototype and for you to g um Sarah present the evaluation criteria. We then have a finance aspect  which is a spreadsheet  an Excel spreadsheet. And I know what you're all thinking of  oh my  um because we're only given a forty minute time period to get it all in  including the production evaluation. So we're going to make a very fast track. Okay. Um and as you can see that's what we do next on this thing. So the first thing I have to do is close this so that I can get to Where is it? I need to open mine. Not the agenda. No that th I want the minutes from the previous minutes. That should be there  minutes. Yeah. Okay. Uh from meeting three  is it alright with you if I don't switch it to show  just use it as is? 'Cause this way I can more easily flip it. Okay  um obviously all of us were here for the last meeting  we reviewed the previous minutes before that  um each of you made your presentations. Um we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations. The market trend of fruit and veg  mm spongy  uh fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy. Um we decided chip on print would be used. Um we would use plastic with a rubber casing  I think was the consensus  powered by kinetic energy. There was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight. Um perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that. Um looking like a scroll  but it's really a push button technology  excuse my spelling um that was actually in use  that is uh behind the scenes is push button which we uh according to Kate have a very good uh grasp on doing that in production. Um we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a separate product that could be suggested to management. Um and as suggested um yellow with black buttons with the company logo  a slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us. Um we did have a few production issues and coordination of the various bits and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints and we ran out of time. Um we had to follow that up and prepare for the last one. And uh we closed as it ran out of time. Is that a fair presentation of what happened? Okay  back to this meeting. Um we're down to the prototype presentation. Over to you. Ooh  two. Ah. Uh-huh. 'Kay. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Oh I see  the on-off's in the back. And then you can use your thumb. I could see this thing  unless it's reinforced  having a problem with the you know yeah. Hmm. Okay. The next item is evaluation. Uh if that's if you're finished. Oh sorry. Try again. Hmm. Well we will soon  unfortunately. Come on. No . Elegant. Elegant. Mm. Yeah. The chunk. I think between the two  somewhere between the two is true. It's more true than false  about a two. Mm-hmm. Trendy. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Excess buttons. No. Better  more intuitive buttons  yes. No. I like it. Mm-hmm. Yes  the instinct says true. Yeah  that's not a cheap thing to get. Hmm. I think we're good. Okay. We're a little over halfway through the meeting and the next big thing is the finance. Okay. Yep. Right. Right. And as you can see it says the same thing  it had not lost itself  thank Goodness. And we're going to raise what's called a sp a spreadsheet that they provided to me. Um and it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device. Hand dynamo  battery  kinetic  solar cells. Okay. Yeah. Um what's a hand dynamo? Oh shoot  forget that. Kinetic is um and how many of those will we need per we only need one. Okay. Electronic simple chip on print  and we'll need one of those. Okay  and we only need one of those. Okay  the case will be uncurved and flat or a single curve or a double curve. It looks like it single curve  'cause of th the chunkiness. It's that's uh uh one. And that's uh that's the the one that goes like this. Right. No  single curve. Okay  case material supplements. Plastic  wood  rubber  titanium  special colour. We had the special colour. And did we say plastic? Yeah. Okay. We'll come back  if we can  to the rubber being added at the moment  that's where we are. Interface button push button interface. That's what we're using  isn't it? Whoops  don't want that  not yet. Um No  it just says push button interface. Button supplements  they'll be in a special colour of black. And the buttons Wha what is the buttons made of  rubber? So we need one of them. And are they any special form? 'Cause the rate we're going we can put the rubber on top. Oh. Okay. Um let's put that rubber in then  of the case material supplement. Uh we only need one of them. Um and the total cost has been calculated as nine Pounds twenty out of the twelve and a half we were allowed. We're in. That's us. Okay  I'm going to save this into our desktop  project documents. Okay. As our project document bit. Yeah. There we are. That's the only Excel document that will be in there  so it's there for all of us. Okay  so  are they under twelve fifty? Yes  go to the project evaluation  next slide. Right. Um the project process  satisfaction with  for example  the room for creativity. Yeah  leadership  teamwork  means  of having whiteboard  the digital pens and all that kind of good things. Uh-huh. Okay. So  we went over all those things and we're satisfied with all the above. Um did we find any new ideas? So we actually worked well as a group. Right. Are the costs within the budget? Yes. Is the project evaluated? Yes. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Alright. And we've therefore we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary  I have a final report to present  um and then we're done. We done good  and we're finished in time. I believe that is the end of our meeting. Thank you  Melissa. ,The Project Manager introduced the project to the group and gave a timeline for the project. The group trained themselves to use the meeting room tools by drawing on the whiteboard. The Project Manager presented the project budget and the projected price point and profit goals. The group discussed several of their initial ideas for the features of the product. They discussed making the remote able to control multiple devices  protection from water or from dropping the remote  and a locator function. The Project Manager then instructed the User Interface Designer to research users' requirements  and instructed the Industrial and User Interface Designers to research the functions and usability features that were discussed in the meeting. 
It's not saved yet. So Our beautiful drawing. Are we doing the the speech recognition? Because we didn't have enough time to uh de um design the inside as well. Okay yeah. Well then then we're gonna put it in. Yeah  just uh we have to design the inside then  but it should be uh It's may maybe uh a bit stronger as well. Okay  so when you have a lot of room inside. So you can make it very easy to use. 'Cause you can write a lot of comments besides it. No. Yeah  we're gonna use the advanced chip then. Advanced chip was for uh spee Yeah. Okay. Good. Together? I'll give comments. Speech recognition. Um I didn't have a specification of that. But um I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something. Um so I've Yes  you need options to configure it  and after that you don't need 'em anymore. Yeah  you can put 'em all on the back. That's for sure. That's uh We also don't know how many buttons are required  or what kind of buttons. But You have a lot of room if you can slide it open. You Yeah I know. I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something. So But it's enough room. Uh well Well the main  the main zap buttons are most central. That was the the most important thing. So uh the best place  the best reach place Um on-off buttons  text buttons  mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are  easy to find. Um the on-off button is a bit bigger  uh so it stands out. That way you don't have to make it red  'cause it's will uh will show up. Uh scrollwheel is on the left side. It's basically the be standard place for scrollwheel  as far as I know. Yeah. Okay yeah  they Yeah okay. That's that's below that then. It's uh twelve buttons. Yeah okay  just we just missed that. But um I'll just uh I'll get back to later. F the form well  we've taken that from the iPod  other popular technical device. So um should be popular. Um The f uh the buttons creating? Uh if you That or all round shapes  not uh rounded corners. So that  you know  you get a bit round feeling. Um we'll use hard plastic. Since that allows us to use uh two D_ buttons  uh non-rubber buttons. Colour changeable. Well and um the backlight thing  the thing that lights up. We have decided uh in the the channel buttons  there's a little uh colour around it. And also in the num-pads  there's also colour light behind it. So when you pre Yeah. We're going to implement. Yeah. Mm just a little Yeah. Yeah  I um To your video device. Yeah. Is i Ah okay. Um slides I think. It's You can do it that it claps open  but I think that's not solid enough. If that breaks then you're screwed. So it do doesn't even have to slide all the way open. Um Uh i the the speech functions buttons. Menu button. With uh maybe uh arrows. So you can uh scroll in the  navigate the menu. Um I think we can even put a We have one for the zero and one for the for the more digit uh channels. So you have one left for the Right  the video channel  Play Station  etcetera. That's used pretty often. If you have a Play Station  mm you use it every day. That was it. Uh It doesn't really matter. That's Yeah well we don't have any uh Hmm? What else? Uh menu buttons with arrows. S Just uh like Um I think it's best if we do. Mm where do we have Or there. Like on the normal uh Like this. The menu button  yes. Well we don't have any  anything on how many buttons speech requires. So you can't redesign it. Yep. Just press it once  the colour should uh switch. Press again  the colour switch again maybe? Yep. Yeah  maybe some uh some text next to the scroll wheel  that it is volume. I just uh The volume logo. Yeah. Yeah  we have that on the the text button. Uh why not? No Whoa I think um Yeah  the three stages. Yes. No  it doesn't have to turn it off. Just don't Yeah. I dunno if Yeah  I think as well  but Uh yeah. Yeah  in thi the the remote control in the the chip. Yeah  that's true. So yeah. Um do we need to fix that or Just like your telephone  hard plastic. I think just on the buttons. If you do it abo above or below  it takes uh more space. I don't think the space is worth it. Mm. Okay. Well I think we do If it's really uh  if you can if you can get the iPod look  then it's beautiful  I think. Hmm? Um basic colours  um yeah. Well you didn't say. Maybe um company colours? Black. A bit a bit of yellow. Not not not yellow  but just a bit of light yellow. Like white  also ni or uh always nice. Just um Yes. Yeah  grey. Just dark grey I think. Well we have changeable fronts  so So Yeah. It's hard to decide for us  but yeah. It it's At least it's a lot better than uh current remote controls. Yeah. Mm. Not needed. Yeah  not needed I think. Yeah. What do I think is necessary necessary item? Of course it's reachable. Okay  maybe just some light uh to to light it all up. So you can see what's really there. Not just not re on the buttons or something. Just a green light or some blue light. To light it all up. Yeah. Well yeah. Uh semi-transparent. Yeah  w we've done a a lot of detail in light  so Yeah. Yeah. So I think it's easy to use  but And learnable is a bit Well y just uh f Yeah  I think it's very clear what it all does. Yes. But the second parts  uh like speech  etcetera  that will be harder to learn. It's Yeah it's Device. Okay. Maybe three then. Learnable's Yeah okay. Yeah. Yep  true. Then a two. And the scrollwheel  backlights  slide. But also slide that buttons come out  as well? Okay. Yes. Different colours  so Yeah. That would And we didn't uh But then we also have the the home station. We are forgetting about that now  but We don't recharge. But that's more like uh now. I don't know. Uh Just save  save as? Okay. Yeah  it is. Uh untitled? Yeah  it doesn't matter. Save. N Mm. I think we followed the latest trends. Oh right. Well uh fruit and vegetables  yeah. You can different front uh This is a a power indicator. So you can see how far it's charged up. To call. Um Okay. No no  I want that in. Yeah  th the speaker is very small as well  right? Yes uh. Yeah  we can uh Um different fronts  but standard front won't be  yeah. Yeah. This? Oh  them. Is that uh included? In the twelve Euro or Okay  then we then we need to use it. Yeah. Damn  solar cells are uh expensive. Okay. Mm uh i Yeah  I think so. I think uh everyone uh already. So I think we uh discussed a lot of things about it. So Of course there was. Yeah. One leader to check the time  etcetera. So more like a secretary. Uh I think we we got wrong information at the wrong time. I think that was the m biggest problem. Like uh the prices. If we knew that before  we could have uh had discussion really uh s really quicker. Yeah  and if you had uh fifteen Euros  then we would it. We had to Yeah. I think uh everyone listen to each other. Like marketing said things and then we had to i include them in the design. It was Just doesn't work. Well uh smart board would be very uh nice to work with  if it worked really well. Just not work too slow. Yeah  more accurate. Yeah  it's i It should be more accurate. And uh I think it would be great if you could edit it from  just with a mouse  from where you're sitting. Not just pointing out on it. Yeah. No use to draw on the board itself. It's just slows down. Yeah. Yeah  even harder to draw like this than black board style. Yeah. You cou You could draw on it  but not as main function. We did it. New ideas found. Oh I just think if we uh I dunno. For remote control  a favourite for your text. That's for. Yeah  this this is just the idea phase  the Yeah. Details uh Quite early. Oh  what do we have to do now. Do we uh I thought we were done at four o'clock? Yep. Mm we can do it afterwards  so Yeah. I found it as well. One two three four five six seven cameras. Mm not bad. So that was it. This is The old versions. They went for uh for a universal device. Yeah  but also a different device. Then an L_C_D_ uh would be handy. Yeah  and touch screens for all our stuff  yeah. I do agree with that. Yeah  tu-dum. English is not so hard by the way. Well  leader? Project Manager? You do? Yeah  you have to make a choice. Wow  that's pretty quick. Uh uh um You have to decide. It's the lower one. No no  the upper one is the bomb. Yes. I knew it. No. That's too much work. Come on. I challenge you. No  you gotta use the magic pen. Hmm. What if I put one there? We'll see. I don't agree. Yeah  you had two choices. That's gonna be draw. Or not. I'll put it here. You are going to put it there. Then It's a difficult choice  either here or there. Ugly. Oh a pen. Yeah  but Then do it correctly. Stupid  the L_C_D_ screen. What? Okay  I'm going to guess what you're drawing. No no  the new one. Uh they just don't save it. A house? Yeah  you have to use the pen s stupid. No  not everything. Pen  select select pen. Okay. It's a house. A plant? Oh yeah  I can know it. It's a Okay  that makes it easier. I think I know. No  wrong. I think I know what you're trying to draw  but it's wrong already. Yeah  you missed the right side. No  you're wrong  you're wrong See where you're wrong now? The entrance. Alright. You're correct. Yeah  but I think Oh no you made another mistake. No I w Okay  I'm not that whiny. But uh there was a big hole here as well  and there as well. That's a kinda big mistake. Warning  finish meeting now. Guys  I think we have to finish the meeting. Uh? What does it say? Come on. Yep. Oh you gotta finish over there? In your own room? I'm gonna be so lonely. Mm I'll clean that up later. What's that? Oops. Mm-hmm. Means Okay. Just just one thing now. Um y you need to have more uh one two th You've got one two three four five six seven eight nine. But you missed the no uh the zero and uh the two stripes. Okay  but It's rather important. Okay. Ah. Okay  there is one uh function I use uh daily  and it's not on the basic functions. It's uh to switch to uh uh your Scart. Play Station or uh D_V_D_ player. That function must be Yeah  maybe Or you can uh i uh lay it uh beneath in the uh other uh functions. And h how does the second level come out? Uh it slides uh along? From from the uh beneath? Menu? Scart? Uh yeah. And so y you keep you keep one  you have one left. Yes. Yeah. It's a f basic uh Yeah  to navigate. Mm okay. Maybe one button to switch the colour of your uh LEDs? Uh and and you can hold it  you can hold it  and then the colours switch or mm multiple multiple buttons. okay. Okay  yeah. Th Yeah. If we have enough place  uh then we can do that. Colour buttons. And then we choose green  uh blue and red or Okay. Okay. That's uh Um It Some text uh buttons. Yeah  but there's one there's one text button I There's one text button I prefer. That's the one uh that you use if you search for a page  uh like seven hundred  uh and it's counting from one hundred to two hundred  you will switch to your television and back to text. Do you do you Did you think of that? Ex Yeah. Yeah. The sta the state you Yeah. No. Just remember where it was. It it doesn't uh uh clear the the page. If you if you turn teletext on  you you set the seven hundred  and you turn it off  then the next time you turn it on  it still stays on seven hundred? But maybe it's not the way Mm. That's maybe one thing we can discuss about. Mm most new T_V_s do uh collect all the pages. But uh not not every every television  so Yeah  I I thought about one thing. Uh the buttons? Uh from which material are they now? Okay. Because um if you use it a couple of years  some uh sometimes the numbers on the on the buttons are slide away  are uh And maybe we can write the numbers below or above? Or shall we just turn it on on the buttons? Well yeah. That's too much place. Okay  just leave it. Just leave it. Yeah  and i The most time Yeah  with rubber buttons. Yeah  okay. Okay. Fine. Yeah  I made some criteria uh  so we can uh ev evaluate our model. I d d d I don't think if it's right. That shall show it. Mm-hmm. Uh no  uh all criterias we just argue about. Uh Oh. Yeah. Evaluation crit Yeah  evaluation presentation. It's not in. Uh d it doesn't matter um It only had two pages or something. Um well I looked in the reports um from the marketing strategy  or uh of uh the the the the the the new needs and uh the market. The Italians uh  how they think about it. And The research uh about uh the the comp uh the the the users and that kind of stuff. I made some criteria  and we have to test the criteria from one to zero. We sh we we we can give it uh a number  and then we can give ourself an average for our um model. And this These are all I I I found  or I wrote down. And um we have to discuss about  if we give it a one or a seven. Uh Yes. Yeah  the the the difference be between uh beautiful and fancy uh look-and-feel is uh the the the outside uh beautiful uh like the iPod or something. And fancy's more like the mm uh f the flashing lights and the colours and and that kind of stuff. The LEDs. Yes. And and what ki what kind of what kind of basic colours uh were you thought uh of? The basic colours are black or green or yellow? Or you haven't thought about Ho how do we make uh Black and yellow. Can Black white  maybe? Uh Because um Okay  so what uh number do we give uh a beautiful? Beautiful is uh really subjective  uh because it has to do lots with the colours. Changeable fronts  so ev for everyone for everyone it's something beautiful. Yeah. A two. Okay. The fancy look-and-feel. That's about our uh flashing lights and the background uh lights uh from from from the buttons. Okay. And we can change the colours  so that's uh really fancy I think. So Slide panel? Oh  you mean th this here? It's pretty cool. If you slide it open  it lights up. That's that's really fancy  but I don't know if it's reachable. Then we do it. Yeah  but Okay. Okay  fine. So I I think it's very fancy. So I'll give it a Yeah  and you can uh also choose your light  so I think it's one. Okay  next. Learnable? Easy to use? Yeah  we shall test it But uh Yeah. Learnable? It's not not as fast as a usual uh uh remote control. Because because I think I think the scroll wheel  uh it's very handy  but the first time you get this thing in your hands  it's not to use the scroll wheel. I think uh you must uh seek for it  and up or down or Uh then the re Yeah. Okay. Okay. But Yeah. But we we've got the two so two uh two or three uh new things  huh? And maybe we uh maybe learnable is in uh compare of old fashion uh remote controls. So we h we have speech  uh the scroll wheel  and um the the the slide. You must slide it. And that's not normal at the uh normal remote controls. 'Cause I think learnable is a l a less than um easy to use. Because easy to use comes after learnable. I I think it a three or something. Oh. Okay. New features. Techno technological innovative? The speech function is new. The scrollwheel and the slide. Uh I think the slide is pretty new. Uh I only saw it in a telephone  not in an remote control. Okay. Okay  and the the the lightning? Is that new? The lighting's new. Scrollwheel. Speech? Yeah  different fronts for a remote control  I think that's new too. So we have a pretty new uh It's it's it's not not L_C_D_ or something. Uh-oh. Home-station. Yeah. Uh all the the seven  uh all the seven. No  we are not extraordinary new or something. Tha tha that No  we we we searched for uh um a young group  audience  beneath f forty. Yes. Yeah  but did we reach  um with our uh style  the targeted audience? Th that's my question. Yeah. Yeah. Um the only point is that we don't uh have uh uh That's that's That's this question. Yeah  this. So we targeted it? But we didn't follow the latest trends. Tha these are the only latest uh trends I uh get on my computer. Uh yeah  th So we had we uh have uh a fruit uh Oh yeah. But spongy will never be. So we give ourself a three or something. Okay. That's uh What's the average? A perfect score. No  I don't know. And and you need n uh a button to call it  to let it beep. Call That's Yeah  but it No  we need that. That's usable. That's really usable. It's uh Yeah. I did save it. That's fine. Come on  it's perfect. Uh twelve point three point three. Special form  yeah. Four. It's four Euros. Yeah. So we are Okay. Yes. Or a different style. Yeah. We could make a lot of different uh remote controls. So it's creativity. Who was the leader? Yeah yeah. We were not finished. Uh. Yeah  because the prices uh could be twenty Euros or something now. And then Yeah. Yeah  uh everybody could speak their uh opinion. And uh Yeah. Digital pen or Yeah  the drawings are are hard to make  I think. Precise. Digital pen. New ideas. For for for To gather  or to uh work together  uh or new ideas for No  for the prototype. New ideas. Hmm. I should take some pictures uh. Yes. Let's play minesweeper. Ti-din ti-din. I'm breaking a world record here. Oh shit. We've got a problem  Paul. Yes. No it's your choice. Tu-dum. Just pick one. What's this? A bomb or not a bo This the bomb? Wrong. Shit. I knew it. Four in a row. Uh. Is that previous work? Oh  that's so stupid. No  that doesn't work. That's stupid. Okay. Mm. Sorry. Too bad. Yeah  then I put it there. No one wins. It's just the same as normal. Okay. Stupid design. Stupid. 'Kay wait  I'm going to draw something and you must y Okay  blank. Oh. Um I know uh. Oh. Pen. No  it's Only you can know it. It's uh very hard to draw. Mm. It's very Fuck. F A little bit maybe  but Yeah. Okay  the entrance is uh more to the left. Okay. But but but I think this part Oh. Yeah  there are a lot of mistakes  because the walls are thick like this. Oh  that's true. Uh here. Yeah  they're walking behind the walls. 'Kay this is a hard one. Okay. Che-che-che-che. Tu-dumm. Uh. This is That's my new interface. That's a uh edited smiley. Tom-ti-dom. Uh. Okay. Okay. Oh  okay. Yeah. Yeah  and Or are we making a slide open  like underneath? Or fold open? I don't know. It's probably better. Yeah  s Like underneath uh you can slide it open and you other functions. Yeah. Think that's better. The Yeah  I I think so. I don't know. Ah okay. Yeah. Yeah  it's Let's do it together. Okay. Yeah  we just made a Word file with the basic elements. Uh the look-and-feel model. Uh well the form  the case um as drawn there. Simply a square with uh round corners. So that's basically it. Uh the material should be hard plastic. Uh colour changeable  and also transparent. And colour and transparent  or just transparent  I don't know. Um then the elements. Uh we have The functions are just basic. Like uh I've pointed them here. Mute function  on-off function  text functions. This uh switch channel. And this is the the num-pad. And the logo is over here  and the mic. And the scrollwheel  no? You operate that with your pointing finger. So you hold it like this in your right hand and Uh I dunno. Yeah  maybe maybe uh you have to configure it. Yeah  or or on the slide function  I don't know. Well we haven't had time to design that  the slide pad. Yeah. Um the position? Yeah  you write uh You wrote this  so. Yeah. But it's not uh impossible to use it  if you're left handed. So y Because you can use your thumb then. Mm yeah. Yeah  okay. just so you get that. Yeah. Yeah  these are just basic functions  so All the non-basic are in Okay. Um Okay  maybe we use this button for the Yeah. A second level? Like a a new blank one or Or just here? Okay. Yeah. So what do we need? Yeah  just God damn it. So this is the Extern or something. So here are multiple speech buttons  I don't know how many. I don't know the functions. Okay. What else? What else? Uh menu. Uh With arrows. Like a normal um Yeah  with in the middle um a menu button. Okay. Yeah  okay. We can put those here. So did we miss anything? Okay. Oh wh Here? Okay. Yeah  or th or the Yeah. Yep. Yeah  but then you can switch back to normal telete teletext. You just switch it off and then Well w we thought of a text button. And if you press it again  you get the the the through view. Yeah  b but but if you're in the second stage  the third stage is switch teletext off. So you can switch back from second to w first. Okay  okay. Yeah mm nee uh No  if i uh the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred  page seven hundred to the television. Th th th if you switch it on. Th i Yeah  I dunno. Okay. Yeah  those memory functions. Yeah. Was uh this logo for uh volume? Okay. So that's it? Mm. No no Yeah. Just hard plastic. So Uh I think just um Yeah  but I think uh you have that problem more often with rubber buttons. In the bottom. No  evaluation is Yeah beautiful's is also a matter of taste. And what colours should the buttons be? But can you change those too  with uh the switch? Okay. Yeah. It's ju so subjective. One more thing. Are w are we changing uh Or are they there uh backlights on the slide panel too? Or n no back light? Yeah? And and the switch channel is uh There is a back light too? Yeah. Hmm. Yeah  just backlight. Not not the buttons. And th and the the normal backlights also not the buttons  but behind the buttons. So the buttons are just grey. Okay. No  but you don't have to use that. And you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer. That's th that's the main thing that's so good about it. Well  I think it is. So so few information that you can easily decide what buttons w for what function. Mm uh. The normal. And the one you showed is just all buttons and you don't know Yeah. The speech function and the colour. Colour. Mm it's pretty new  I think. Speech is new. Yeah. Yeah  we didn't draw that too  but Yeah  that's just a normal th s simple thing. Well it's a already in the folder. L like number seven. I think it is. No  I think it is. Okay. Mm two  I think. Yeah. We've got a one for fancy look-and-feel  and that's what attracts the young audience. So think that's a two or a one. Yeah  but s it That's basically not not handy. And I don't thi I don't see Yeah. Yeah. No. Yeah  you could make a a front a front that's that's like uh like a banana  or something. Like a a f banana kind of front. No. Yeah. Eleven divided by six. We're not too hard on ourselves. Okay. Okay. Yeah  but uh we have to make a speaker then too. If you want to make it beep. But we can we can do it uh underneath the logo. If you do uh Yeah  okay. Mm okay. But uh is uh uh Okay. But but is it inc Does it include a a homestation or Can we make that for uh h twenty cents? Yeah. Yeah  it's four. It's kind of weird that we we get this information now  afterwards. Because Sure. Beautiful. Yeah m If we got a high mark for um uh innovativeness or innovativity then there we probably have been creative. Yeah. Huh. No  I think Yeah. Just normal discussion  I think. Not one leader or something. Yeah. And make notes. Yeah. Yeah  w we had so much information  that we get through email and just Yeah. Yeah  th that's weird. Hmm hmm yeah. So we're bacal basically just lucky to uh get the price right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  i if if it would be faster  it would be great. Yeah. Yeah  and p just point with a mouse. Yeah. Just old fashioned kinda blackboard style. But you might as well do it in normal computer style. Yeah. Yeah. And it's far too slow this way. No. What's that? Hmm. Yeah  but still  you couldn't make a fancy a f you couldn't make a a prototype out of this. Because we don't have any sizes and Yeah  but it You can't possibly do that in such a short time  I think. Yeah  just brainstorming basically. So are we finished? Okay. Yeah. Oh okay. It's now quarter past three. So Yeah. Now we can look at this. We're probably not supposed to look at this  but Yeah  from the previous group. The touchscreen  yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Here are the basic functions in here  the selecting dev devices. Hmm. No. Yeah  this one. Hmm. This is a very interesting design. Well it has a L_C_D_  I think. And what else do we have? Yeah  everything. It wants to know what we do in our spare time. Warning. Finish meeting now. Warning. Warning. Okay. Boom-boa-ring-bing. Fill in the questionnaire. What now? Okay. No more chit-chat. Yeah. Okay. Oh. Okay. So just f um So this is our agenda. You're F You're going to show your pr prototype presentation after me. Uh I didn't Oh yeah. So these are the So these are the um last notes we I made. If anything doesn't look right  just say it to me then. I don't have to put it in the report. Okay  but it's still possible uh uh financially. So if you want to  it's okay. Okay  just Slide open is uh quite usable for remote controls. Maybe that's better. Yeah  that's that's a very good point. Yeah. Okay. So this is okay? Okay  so that's Uh I'll just have a look how much that is. But um Okay  for the Okay. No  you have a different chip for speech recognition. So So I already calculated that and it's still in the budget. So it's okay. So you can show your prototype if you want to. Okay  cool. Okay. Mm. So how many functions do you need for for uh the microphone? Yeah  speech recognition. Just Only one button to say it's on or off. So you can put it on the back as well if you want to. Okay. Yeah  you can put it separate. Okay. And do you still can  do you still can choose what colour  kind of colour you want? How do you want to implement that? Just on the Maybe on the second level as well? Okay  just draw draw the second level  because we need that as well. Yeah  as well. Just make make a Just just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something. Yeah. No no  just on Down there. So uh Just uh if you s Yeah  y Maybe  yeah. For the bottom. No  you gotta slide it. Yeah  it's right. Yeah. You want to save that file as well? The drawing? Doesn't really matter. Just just uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Or we just make it three buttons  all the colours on it. Just red  yel uh red  green and That's that's very easy  yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. No  ma on on o on the on the Yeah. Just make it Yeah  just put it on those extra f extra function as well. Oh just three stages  you Yeah  that's okay. Yes  that's to remember. Yeah  but that's that's uh That's a functionality for the television. Okay. Yeah  but you have to search every time again. That's what what happening if you do it like that. But it's still the television that has to do that. No  that's what the television does. Okay  it's cool. Yeah  that's fine. Is this prich pretty much it  yeah? It's too expensive to make it from a different material anyway. Yeah? Okay  cool. Mm mm mm mm mm. Yeah  I don't know what this means. But I think we just evela evaluated this one. Oh okay  you made some criteria. Okay  cool. Okay. You have some usability criteria or Okay. Look-and-feel? Okay. Okay. Uh I think uh if you have a kind of iPod idea. It quite beautiful. It's We are actu We are the Flashy. But uh It's black. Yeah  yellow light. Do we have yellow light? No  not really  but it's possible. It's Yeah  different colours. This is Oh  the same as th th the cover. But also th the light behind it. No  no. Make them No  just make them black or grey or something. Yeah. Yeah  just give it a one. It's okay. It's perfect. I think it's just what you want. Or not? Okay  just give it a two. Yeah. No. No  it's only on the number  behind the numbers and uh That as well  yeah. Yeah  but that's unnecessary. Yeah. It doesn't make No. Yeah. But Yeah. Mayb Okay. Yeah  just only Yeah  that's right. So Yeah  that's how I think. Ye Yeah  this It is a one. It's okay. It's cool. This is a difficult one  because we we don't Yeah  we don't know it about the Uh it's it's very easy to use  but uh the second layer is not easy to use. It's That's No. But the rest of it is very easy  because there are so so n So it is learnable um f i i In the first place it's very easy to use. And I think its scrollwheel is u easy to use as well  if you have ever used uh a different kind of uh of uh device. But yeah. Okay  just Easy to use is very cool  so just give it a two. No  but definitely better  much better than uh than uh than avera average  yeah. Okay. Slide is not n is is not new. No. I already have a Uh I already have a V_C_R_ and it's about from nineteen eighty eight. And they all have a slide in it. So that's not new. Yeah. That's cool. Yeah for a Uh for a f There are no games on it  that's that's It's not a one  it's a two again. But If you have Yeah. Oh yeah  that's right. Rechargeable. Yeah  just draw it afterwards. If you Can you save it on the same  in the same map as the other ones? In the the project uh map? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Uh save as? No  that's not in the project. Oh yeah  okay. Smart board. Yeah  but this one. This one is not yet in the Oh oh. But you still have to draw the resi the recharger. Okay. And new features  so we give it a two or also again a one? No  I think i if you have games on it  then then you give you have a one. But not No  just so it's still a two. Targeted audience. Uh we are the targeted audience? Do we like it? Yeah  but l younger than forty. So we we are exactly the targeted group. I think so  yeah. You get the fancy things for younger people. And you get the the aesthetic things for older people. So you want Yeah  you get different colours. So Oh. So that's eleven. It's Yeah  it is one point eight three. Oh yeah  that's still Yeah  maybe we have to skip that one. Okay. So I just got a financial um You s saved it or No. Okay  let's have a look at this one here  the production cost of it. If I forgot anything  just say it to me. It just is a battery. Yeah  there are some that they didn't mention  because recharge is not on the list. But okay. So I think we are pretty much in the right direction  because it's twelve point three Euros. So this is a regular chip incl and and a sample speaker. So that's both. Yeah  and single curved curved. No  that's not on the list. But that shouldn't be. Probably. I just The b the button supplements  I didn't I d I was wondering if this special colour maybe was I'm not sure. See it's I think it's okay like this. It's hard to say. But maybe we have to um Yeah  okay. Special colour  you can skip this one  because it's all quite normal. We get different ones  that's all. So you can put a recharger in it as well. But this is expensive  the sample speaker. Yeah. Yeah  that's included. Yeah  no. Okay  so this is uh pretty much it this. So I just want you Yeah  we just made it. So we can do the project evalu evaluation now for uh for everything together. Okay. We can do some discussion about this. Was there room for creativity? Paul  was there room for crea creativity? Yeah. Yeah. Okay  so the leadership Was there a leadership and Okay. What do you have to say about that? I dunno. Yeah  I know. Okay  next one. Uh team work um The the third meeting I think that one was pretty hard. We were not all We were not um agree with every not agree with. We're not finished. Yeah. Yeah  finance. But the teamwork was okay. Yeah. 'Kay. Yeah  what I have to say about uh means. The smart board is okay. Digital pen is horrible. I dunno if you use it. But if you want to download it to your computer  it's doesn't work. No. Yeah. It's the same for the presenta for the presentations. You can do it from here. That's much easier than standing there. And so you've Yeah. Yeah  like. Okay. I think Yeah  okay. So we made it in time. And we made a remote control. In the budget  yeah. I don't know what it mean. Just For remote control probably. No  for the project. Yeah. But it's for the next team. We don't have to do that. Yes  I think just I just write a final report. No  we have only four minutes left. Uh it's okay. Okay. You have to save everything  you know that  huh? Okay  yeah. ,The User Interface Designer presented the major components of the interface design  dividing the interface into two parts: voice commands and buttons. The Marketing Expert went over users' requirements as seen in a company study and showed that the major complaint was that remotes were too difficult to use. She also showed that users want fancier and more ergonomic designs  shock protection  voice recognition  and LCD screens. The Project Manager announced a new requirement to the group  that the remote is only to control televisions. The Industrial Designer gave a layout of the internal functions of the device and showed that a standard chip  instead of a larger one that would accomodate voice recognition  would be the most feasible. The Project Manager announced also that the group was not to include a teletext function and that they should integrate the company logo into the external design. The group decided on what button functions should be included and decided to eliminate the LCD screen and voice recognition from the design due to time and cost restraints. 
Okay  welcome everyone to our next meeting. I'm busy writing and busy leading the meeting  but um I've prepared a little presentation once again um or at least an agenda I think uh the biggest part of the presentation will be uh on your side. Um we are here at the conceptual design meeting  which is hereby opened. Um once again I will try to uh write some minutes which I just from the previous meeting uh placed inside our project folder  which was quite some typing. Um today we once again have uh three presentations  if I'm right  and after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts. And just as the last time we have forty minutes to accomplish that. Okay  well I'd say let's start with the first presentation. Um in the same order as last time? Okay. Well  take it away. Mm-hmm. Well  business colours I thought it was the the slogan and uh the corporate image  so yeah  it needs colour  but I don't think you have to make the entire thing in the corporate colour. It must be recognisable. Okay  thank you. Mm. Mm-hmm. Thanks. Now our third team member with his presentation. Oh y So for the older people  a more traditional uh form. Yeah  I guess changing colours will be easier than changing uh the shape of it. But maybe then both groups won't buy it. Mm-hmm. Yeah we think so too. Hmm. So we need a spongy feeling. Yeah. And we won't include a a pen  or something to point  hey  we we want to do it with our fingers  right? Yeah. Yeah but I think people want to use a remote with with their fingers because th they're used to that and And maybe we have to add a tissue to remove the grease from all the fingers  huh. Okay well maybe  if I can interrupt you  maybe I should uh should show some points on which we uh should take a decision. So we can discuss these points. those points um energy question mark. How how should we uh supply the thing with energy and how are we going to do it with separate docking station and then put in it. Uh chip on print and case. Those are points my uh coach advised me to discuss here  but I hope you have ideas about them. Yeah. So that's the the the first point. We already decided that on the previous meeting. Mm-hmm. Simple rechargeable uh batteries. Yeah but how did this how does that with a L_C_D_ screen? You still have a print plate. Mm-hmm. Yeah well it's a good question. It just was in there and I didn't have any information about it  but Mm-hmm. Well you need some kind of C_P_U_  I guess. Mm-hmm. Because we're projecting projecting the buttons on the L_C_D_ screen. Yeah. Yeah. But that's what we want . Mm-hmm. Yeah yeah you have a fancy design  then  right away. So Okay so Yeah but I wrote it down. What about the user interface  there are also some some questions uh about the concepts I think you have some ideas on that. You you showed your drawing. Mm. Everybody's searching in his data. Yeah well I think we have we don't have to decide about that now how where we will put the buttons just the concepts. Yeah well we just heard about the new uh technology  huh? Mm-hmm. Yeah maybe at the bottom where you can can hel hold it with you hand that there's also a microphone uh over there. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Well maybe just in the the spot you just pointed out because I think it should be in a in an important position where people can see it  because it is the the unique uh idea of our remote  huh  the the speech control. Well maybe where the one hand But are we talking about the button  or about the microphone? Yeah because a microphone is very small thing  but you can make it look like it's big so as its its really an important function of the remote. So well uh type  supplements  anything. Yeah  well we already s discussed that  huh  the the L_C_D_ and Mm-hmm. And I think I would it would make even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side which you can touch and Yeah. Okay. Well there's our five minutes uh warning. Um any more uh questions about about the design or the user interface or different components  everyone? Everybody think they can can work for that? Is there a standard colour? Yeah. But still silver and black are well silver is new but also traditional  so uh Yeah w what about a yellow thing  I mean it could be ugly  but it's definitely fancy. Mm-hmm. Yeah I would think about colours like uh red  yellow  green  blue  just Yeah. Mm-hmm. Maroon. Yeah. Okay  so Who's pinging? You are pingin Okay. I thought we Okay  so uh that wraps it up? Everybody knows uh what to do? Well I wrote it down here. I wrote it down here what to do um. The next meeting is once again in thirty minutes. Um here are the individual actions  and especially notice that uh the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer are going to work together on a prototype drawing on a smart board  and of course to all four of us uh specific instructions will be emailed by our personal coach. Well I I'd say just wait uh for email and uh find out. I don't know. Okay well that was what I had to say  uh  final thoughts from anyone  or? We're finished. Okay  well thank you very much. Mm. Alright. Hmm. It's a colour. No. You can put the R_ and R_. Alright. I will go next. Alright so I thought a little bit about the interface. Uh how it should look. And uh uh we uh determined that will not be no buttons  but only an L_C_D_ screen  so I had to uh look on that. And the design is therefore based on what we just uh uh thought of. Uh first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition. And this is that uh um uh uh you you ask you give a question through through the device and it answers you. And they already uh put this in an in a coffee maker. And so that it you say uh good morning  uh coffee maker  and it says t says to you back good morning Joe or what's your name. This uh and there's an easy way to uh program that uh you say record into the device into the speaker and then you say the question and three seconds later you say the answer and then when you say the question it gives you the answer. Um perhaps it's useful  perhaps for because people um lose the remote  they can yell uh remote where are you and calls or something. And perhaps we could uh implement that. And then I have to go out of the presentation because I tried to make some kind of a a idea of how it should look like but I can't draw  so uh don't make too much of it. I tried to uh the L_C_D_ screen I tried to sort of to draw. I thought uh at least uh the icon for the volume. I don't know if there is an icon for the program  but yeah. So uh and then the buttons above and uh below the and the and the mute button also recognisable as an icon. Um. I forgot that one. I thought I forgot something  but uh. And uh and uh the numbers  that should be a bit larger I think it's not really on scale and and so forth. Um an options button. And I thought the the button for teletext apar uh apart because it's not really options  I think. It's uh options is the settings of the remote and of the T_V_ and that kind of uh thing. So could call it settings or something. But this is a bit uh how I thought it. And uh the L_C_D_ uh somewhere on the remote. Perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should  so that it's better in your hand or something uh. But uh and and uh a microph microphone for the speech uh recognition if we want to implement that. Uh and then uh if you press the op options button  now we have an example of and then you should get the other options with what what you could do and that you could do with something like this this. And uh it's also uh I thought think we discussed uh earlier that uh older people don't really want to use uh these extra settings. And older people a also don't really want to use this uh th this kind of option menus. So they want to u use one button and then something happens  and not choose with uh this kind of uh And you could put in a an a really s little scrolling device on the side of your uh remote  so you could scroll scroll uh across these uh things. That's an option. And that was my uh finding dinge. Yeah. Grass green. Let's build it into a sponge. It was one remote  I think  different colours. You could you could uh change the colours  that was also the idea. I don't know which shape you should should take  but. Yeah. Perhaps you could find something in the middle. Round but square. Yeah. Uh i i if you do it uh uh square  with round corners but a little uh in the middle of it uh i Do you know what I mean? wait  like like this uh a bit. So it's a bit square  but it's also a bit uh round. So but then Same sides. But that's uh Yeah but that's also how other remotes are shaped  so that's uh But perhaps that's a good thing  so that's easy to use. People know the Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Swords. Yeah. But that's easily to do with the colour  I think. That's easy to do with the colours  I think. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah think uh Also in between. I don't think you should be able to mould it  but Yeah. Bit like this kind of rubber. This uh But it's quite hard  this. Yeah. I don't think it's rubber. Uh did you have something about uh So we should first decide about shape  I think. Which uh Then you can fit the L_C_D_ screen in it  and can decide uh. Yeah it it's supposed to be bit s bit s bit Yeah. Ooh Yeah. But if you pu Now you can put your hand there and then you won't touch the screen. Perhaps that's best. But not on the screen because Yeah that's uh that's an idea. Looks a bit like a Game Boy now. You always touch it  yeah. Yeah. Y you could include a pen. Yeah o yeah  if they think it's handy to use a pen. Yeah I think this uh this is a good size for the screen. I don't know how how large the actual remote should be but a little bit like this  or something. Yeah. I think energy were batteries and then uh and uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just like with the telephone. but it should be th I think normal batteries  not not like two or two uh Yeah. Yeah. Um what was with the chip on print? Yeah. It's rubber. Yeah but but a hard rubber like this? Or softer rubber or Yeah. It bounces back from the floor where you throw it. Yeah yeah this in different colours? Yeah it's a bit. But I think it should be a bit longer  perhaps. Yeah. I think so too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  that's a good idea. Yeah  alright. And then Yeah  you can uh It's pretty easy but And Yeah  I had what I just uh I should again. I miss a few buttons  but. Well. At least uh what we should also have on  I just remembered  um a menu to go back through the first uh if if you touch options  you can't go back to this uh right away now. This I don't know. I think it's I don't know. I I thought it was uh easier to handle this way  but I don't know what they think. Would you like the the buttons horizontal or v vertical? Th Right well if we make it like this  I think if you put it like this Yeah. Yeah. But I think I wou I think that's a matter of what you're used to. I think I would put a plus and a min uh here. And then the P_ in the mid in the middle and the sound uh in the middle. Almost. Yeah but I think when you are holding it  you could press the minus and the plus and with the other finger the minus and the plus. Yeah but I think Yeah I don't know. Perhaps I have some examples. I don't know That's me. But I'm going to look if I've got some examples 'cause perhaps you should choose what's most often used. The 'Cause they can use that better. Yeah. I Here is our here are uh I don't really know. Yeah. Yeah but But I mean if it's usually plus or min above each other or next to each other on a normal remote. W what's what's usual or normal. Yes I'm looking here. But here's it's below  here also  and now here's here's next to each other. I think it's it's a Yeah. I think the the the volume was usually uh above each other  because you go higher and down. And the the pay the the the program is next to each other  because you would go further and back. That's how it's is usually when I look here that's what I see. I don't know. Yeah. This concept is in the actual design  but you should know where you would place a And the speech uh shall we implement that? Or uh Yeah. But then you should also find a place You could if you do it like this you could put it in a corner or something. You can talk into the corner. Yeah. Yeah. But Yeah  that's also. So  in the middle or something. but you should uh decide where you want to put it. Right? You could p you could put it in a logo of the company. Yeah. Yeah. So where do you want to put it? Yeah actually it does because it you can you can find it better if you use it. It's a way for you to uh So it makes more sense just 'cause other remotes don't have that. About a microphone  there is no button. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Any more uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um yeah. Yeah the the young people do like uh scroll uh yeah. Or at least Yeah I don't know if it's really the scroll  but the menu they like most  and I think you can never get through a menu great with a scroll uh But you have it's f uh we have five or four or something. Yeah. Yeah. It's also different. You should you should have a black one because uh I think black is standard. But if you want to be different  then uh Silver. Silver rubber. But yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just all kind of colour. Yeah. And and do we have to have a normal black one  or uh Is it Yeah. Well I don't know what to do  but. Ooh. Right. Yeah. But do we have to We'll work together  but do we have to stay here  or do we Right. Yes. Okay. Yeah I think. No. Yeah. So we have to keep talking English now? 'Kay. Don't destroy my giraffe. Drop it. Bright colour. Fancy colour. Forward. You have to go t Oh it's a side view. True. No no no no no. Just looking. Mm mm mm. Next. It's true. P_ yeah  just a P_. Where's where's the button for two? Okay. Doesn't matter. No. Okay. Okay  I'm going to tell you something about a trend watching. The trends from the past years  what the people like  what the youngsters like  what the elderly people liked about shapes  colours  material and stuff. 'Kay. The method I used was Like I told I watched the trends from the past years about colours  shapes  material they wanted uh from elderly and young people. So we can keep that in mind for designing f uh the device itself. Findings I made. The most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look look fancy. The second important thing that w should be if inv in innov innovative  okay  like the L_C_D_ screen that's quite innovative so that should be great meeting for this. And the third thing is it should be easy to use. I think with only one menu  four button  channel  volume  it should also be enough for easy to use. The personal preferences for the young people  they liked fruity colours like uh banana yellow  uh strawberry red and stuff. Yeah. Like that. The round shapes  and soft material m materials like the rubber. It should be soft uh i it should feeling spongy or s Sponge Bob like things. Th Elderly people like au colours which y are being seen in autumn like um woods um dark brown  red  deep reds and stuff. They liked square shapes with round edges. And hard materials like wood  um titanium. They those kind of materials they liked. This is a bit like the young peoples like the fruity colours  innovative  all the colours you see  the blue  the red  the white  the yellow  that stuff. And then I th I I personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like like this or something. It's it's a bit like a banana. And the colour should be yellow  or something. And for the elderly people just plain old. Because we decided to have two kind of remotes  two designs  or was it two colours? Different colours  yeah. We should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes. I think like my colleague  you said  is that's e better  or for the elderly people something like like the iPod or something  with round squares. Simple but easy to use. So that's it. That is my Yeah  like the older o older colours I can maybe Yeah. Colours th the elderly people Uh Look something like that. Autumn colours like red  brown. They liked the wood a lot. So maybe we could give it like wooden loo look look or something in that colour. And a bit bit old school style renaissance  medieval kind of things. Those kind of Yeah  those kind of things. So you see the big difference between the young people? Fresh  exciting. And the old people  old and boring. So Sorry? Yeah I think it's it's easier to do in colour than in shape. Because otherwise we have to get different shapes  and colour way easier than yeah the shapes. In material yeah rubber  rubber is  like I said  young people like more soft materials and spongy ones and the old people like plain wood. So we have to decide if we're going to use real hard rubber  or soft rubber. Or something something between that. Yeah soft rubber which you can you can feel in it. Or No. Or or wh what's something harder. No no no but but you have to like like like a a eraser or something. That's the bit you can press it in  or something harder. Yeah  something like this  yeah. Yeah it's quite hard but you can press it in. It's feels kind s spongy. Something. No. N n n Are you going to invite Sponge Bob  maybe he can Yeah I think that's the better thing to do. Yeah w I think that L_C_D_ screen should be like Yeah three quarter of the of the Yeah the buttons won't get that small when the L_C_D_ screen is Mm-hmm. Larger I think. Yeah becau because you have Yeah okay  true  true  true true. Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. But it won't get that small because you have how much? Nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen. One to zero  the two digit  You have to you have to Because some fat people with d thick fingers will press three buttons at same time. Yeah true  but Yeah  we have we have the zoom option  right? Yeah. Yeah. No. Yeah. Yeah. Use a pen You you c you can lose the pen. Yeah the fingers  yeah. Yeah but that that can be with plain soft tissue. Yeah  you can buy those at Maybe it's better to to include rechargeable batteries which you can recharge through the docking station. So if the badg the batteries are dead then you can re you can uh change them. Yeah yeah yeah like those. Yep. Yeah  normal plain you No normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop. Yeah. Print plate. Yeah yeah yeah. You always have a print plate. You always have a print plate  right? Always  so I dunno what w what we have to decide about that. Yeah  okay. But Yeah okay  but the p print plate of L_ L_C_D_ screen is more advanced than a normal print plate  so that that's not of any discussion  I think. Mm  I don't I dunno I don't think that's Yeah yeah okay but I d I I don't know if nor o s it's quite a simple L_C_D_. Yeah  it's quite a simple L_C_D_ screen. I think they don't need that big of C_P_U_. Yeah  okay  true true. True. Yeah. We have different colours. So the shapes is something between the square shapes with round colo corners and a round shapes? No I don't think  I think it's more round than square. So it meets I think it meets more the young people than the older people. Yeah  that's our target. Yeah. Lower than forty years  I think it was. Oh yeah that that I think I thought that was a quite good Yeah. You can put it on your table with the L_C_D_ screen  you don't have to put it get it in your hand  you can put it next to you and then dive it in and. Yeah. So You can't you You can't oh  you c you can draw it on your paper and then load it on the And load it on the the user the server. Mm-hmm. Yeah  you have to go back. Yeah uh uh. Isn't it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal? With the minus and the plus. I think it's easier than Yeah. For sound and channel. Yeah. I think it's it's easier to have it something like Oh a button uh minus here  plus over here. A minus here  plus over here. And on here. The other buttons and on here the top. The options and then you have something like uh the P_ over here  and the sound. Something uh Something like Sh Plus minus plus uh minus. Yeah I think you're going to s you're going to use it with one thumb. Who's the usability engineering? She is. Oh. Um Oh I have that those s numbers. Or a good watch. B Channel selection. Per hour one hundred and sixty eight. Volume selection four times an hour Uh Yeah  that depends on on on the remote. I think because I have two televisions at home. One is horizontal  one is vertical  so it depends. Yeah. Depends. Yeah  lower. True. It's got to change. Yeah is it is user interface. Component. Yeah I think it's it's easy for that  where are you  but then it says I'm here. Yeah. Yeah  a microphone  yeah. Um I think where it isn't seen the most. Inside. Yeah. I i between the round of the R_. Yeah. Yeah  okay. Yeah. Yeah bu but I think the left s under corner should be the best. Where isn't i it isn't most in sight. I think. No. Actually doesn't. I think I thought the  like you said  like scroll next to the remote isn't that handy. I think it's better to just up what you'd like to do on the screen. If you want to go back you have to back button go back  if you want to choose audio settings you press audio settings and it goes to that s sub-menu. Yeah? You do like it? Yeah I think it is is faster. Becau I think the scroll's easier if you have a lot of options  but if you don't have a lot of option then Y Uh-huh. Yeah  okay  true. Okay. Okay  no problem. Okay. Um. No  colours are clear  shape is clear  material is clear. And a standard  yeah we don't no we have different colour. How many colours are we going to Black. Yeah  black I think is is the standard. Dark grey  something like this this colour or something. Yeah like like yeah. Or or silver. I think it's better to have silver nowadays. I think you see more silver than black. Yeah the the silver black are our main colours. Yeah. I think we have silver  black and between those is like I dunno s five colours between them or something. Yeah yeah yeah it'll be a banana yellow  we have. R red. Green  wood  brown. Yeah. True. Yeah  I understand. Yeah o of course. The fruity colours and the autumn colours  like red and brown  dark red and brown. No. S tough. We'll be available. No. Finished. W sure. Okay uh welcome you all. Components design  um uh first of all uh I would like to uh uh accommodate some of those uh things I uh uh elaborate some of the things I did. I I elaborated on the concept. What should be um uh said about uh the components  uh its properties and what kind of materials should we use to uh to make uh one of those r remote controls. Uh well first of all I've uh d subtracted some of the components that is that are used uh are w w um you know from what uh the remote control's formed. Uh first of all  the case  the case  the surrounding of the of the the remote control. I would like to uh give you an idea of uh how I thought about. Giraffe's gone now. Okay um the case was is made from rubber  I suppose. There's one of the because when you use a remote control a lot of people uh will uh will uh drop their remote control and they break uh becau the uh titanium was also an option. But uh it's a very expensive material. Uh rubber is  I think  uh the best suitable uh material uh to use uh for our uh for our remote control. Um it's poss it's also possible to uh create fancy colours with rubber. Uh rubber l makes it easy to uh to to it lets lets itself colour. Uh titanium uh you have to paint it and with that uh it's possible to scratch it or uh yeah make it ugly. Uh rubber uh the total uh piece of rubber that's sor uh that's that's used uh to make the case is uh the same colour  so if you scratch it it's still the same colour  perhaps uh it's a little bit damaged. But it's a very strong material. Um I h I had an idea single covered uh curved  sorry  single curved. Uh so it's t two dimensional. I think it's uh it's best to draw oh green. Uh New. Blank. Okay. Let's make it uh black. Okay. I thought of an idea like this. Oh that. Um delete. Blank. Okay. So it also looks nice when it's on your table. So you get uh it doesn't lay flat down on the table  but it's c it's stands. Side view yes it's side view so uh I I'm not technically good at th three D_ modelling  but. Um uh it's just an idea I had so it's uh it's very uh so its also looks nice when it's on the table. Um the graphical user interface and the buttons  uh we also thought about that already. Uh I thought about uh the L_C_D_ touch screen  which is uh is easy to clean too. One of the great uh advantages of the L_C_D_ screen you just use some or uh another uh cleaning uh uh cl some cleaning stuff. And um it should be made of strong plastic and it should be bright. Well I already uh s uh explained some properties of that material and I think uh well we also we almost concluded about that uh this should uh be uh our uh button component. So uh uh that's all about uh the buttons. Uh the batteries  uh we also thought about that already  uh will be chargeable with uh uh an option for a mount station so you can uh put the uh the remote control in a mount station so its charges itself up instead of uh plugging it in or something like that. Questions ? Okay. And they should be long lasting  not uh not be empty uh in about uh two minutes or uh thirty minutes or forty minutes of use. And next step is the chip uh th the component that's uh makes or transmits the signal to the television. Uh there was an option to use s a rather simple chip but I think uh because uh of our uh highly uh requiring uh requirements  there should be an advanced chip in it with uh also the ability to uh facilitate speaker speech recognition uh which unfortunately is still in a test phase  so uh there should be some more uh investigation on that side. Uh my personal preferences uh I also overheard in the last meeting that there shou we should use uh our own business colours. That was correct  wasn't it? Okay. I think they are rather boring for um for use with rubber. Okay they should be m sh they should be in mind  wasn't it? Okay so it d it doesn't says uh to uh have the slogan? Okay okay. Well that's possible of course. We could make a little R_ and R_ on the top of the machine. Uh so they are pretty boring  I suggest  because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours uh and also in a lot of possible colours  so it's possible to make very uh fancy uh remote controls which peopl uh who people in which people will find they're uh interesting. And uh will buy uh them faster when they look at the same old grey or black uh colours. Uh s as I said uh before rubber is uh is impossible to damage severely imp instead of uh of course you can break it when you you when you break it in s for example with a pair of scissors or something like that  but i if you drop it it's not uh broken uh right away s instead of using uh plastic  hard plastic or uh titanium. And I personally liked uh the single curved uh remote control  because it yeah it makes sense. Okay. Well that's all about my uh my findings. Mm. Mm. Mm. Oh my God. Not just a P_. Oh okay. ... Ah. Mm-hmm. Yep. Oh okay  yeah. Oh yeah . Mm. Okay. Go Danny  go Danny. Fruity? Fruity. Mm. Okay. Mm. Okay. Changing just the shape of the uh remote control? Yeah  s round corners  but s but square  yeah. Yeah. Yeah I know what you mean  kind of like a. Yeah. Kinda like a beer glass. Yeah. I know what you mean. It's also easy to to have to to put in your hand. Yeah. Will recognise that's as a remote control. Uh when I saw your d Oh. Huh. Yeah  kinda like old cars  uh Let's put it all together. Uh. Yeah. Soft rubber. Yeah I know what you Um. It should shouldn't be. Uh. Spongy. Yeah. Ding ding. Um I also s uh can't help but notice that you uh used an you had a remote control and the L_C_D_ screen was uh rather small. Um. ... This was your size  but I think it should be larger. Yeah  three quarters. So uh so you don't have to put your oh. Uh new  blank. So uh when you get this uh Uh kinda like this. Or should it be larger? Larger? Because you want to put your hands You want Yeah. Your thumb here. Yeah. Because when you put your f Yeah but if yo if you make the the L_C_D_ screen as large as the remote control itself  uh you'll you'll always get some You Yeah. Going to be very greasy and stuff. Yeah you don't want it too small. How yeah how large Yeah they have thick fingers. But if you wanna make it in international  Japanese uh people got uh rather small hands and we got these large Zoom opt Ah yeah of course  yeah. You can make it larger to to uh to uh with accompanying uh greater fields to push the button. Your fingers  yeah. You don't want uh Because if you lose the pen uh if you lose the pen uh you can't use Yeah You can do whatever uh any uh cloth. Sure. The docking station. W Yeah. I kinda like your Yeah you got some uh some of those uh uh wireless uh mice? Mouse. Computer mouse. Kinda like those kind of batteries. Yeah. The chip on print? Um Uh you gotta f Yeah. I think so. Chip on print with a with a simple uh a sim not a simple but a We also discussed that. Didn't we? Uh Beg your pardon? Yeah sure  of course  yeah. Well uh chip on print  I think what they mean uh with the regular rubber buttons that you got  uh it's always clear for the remote control when you press uh a certain button. But when you got a L_C_D_ screen  with no uh with not the buttons are not always on the same place  for example if you enlarge a button  or if you got several options uh appearing on your screen  uh the co-ordinations aren't always the same. When you got a regular button  th the button of stand-by is always on the same place and you got on the and on the Yeah. I suppose so. It is a simple C_P_U_ but it doesn't Yeah because it has to uh b Yeah but it the the remote control has to know whether you're in a settings menu or just uh you just want to turn up the volume. So it has to have some kind of a calculation unit or C_P_U_ to know uh in which state you are and uh which button you are pressing in at the right moment. Yeah. And a touch screen makes it uh possible to uh to get the co-ordination of your finger on the screen. And the case  yeah we already discussed the case  we wanted to make it from rubber and uh Uh hard rubber I think. That's the easy to ha uh to to uh Yeah. Yeah sure  look. D It's our main target. Well and how about my idea uh of making it um with one single curve? So i Because it's a gadget and you want to show it off  of course. Uh. Because it Yeah. Yeah. It's a lot easier. So  so you got uh Did you write that down? Uh got a single curved uh rubber f uh fancy coloured remote control. Yeah. Sorry? Depends on the screen. If you make the screen vertical it doesn't matter. If you make it uh in a rectangle I so it's it's it's it's Square. Oh  okay. Uh. Take your time. W We'll leave that to the usability engineering then. Yeah. Consistency. Yeah. So not how much n not how often it's used  but Uh. Yeah it does it doesn't really matter  but Uh. Okay  um. Let's cut to the chase. Okay  well le Yeah. Interface  yeah. Technologies  uh. Yeah. Makes it possible to Mm. Not even necessary  because a lotta you can make a very sensitive microphone  so it makes it possible to uh just put it arou uh underneath it or on the on the bottom of the uh remote. Yeah. Right. But that's not import I think that's not im very important because yeah  it doesn't matter where the microphone is. Ah okay  sure  okay  well tha Underneath? Indeed. It shouldn't be uh very uh visible. Yeah sure  why no Yeah but it doesn't makes it uh any more fancy because you get to see uh Uh. Yeah  okay. Okay. Well put it there. I don't mind. That doesn't doesn't really matter. Okay. So? Interface type. The L_C_D_ yeah  uh supplements well the supplement is to yeah. Hey . Use the scroll. Yeah I think so too. So why not  on on side. Fast  yeah. So if you've got a settings  if you Yes. You have a lot of options  because when you use Yeah you get w when you use uh the settings menu for example to look up some uh uh some channels on your uh on your television  you should scroll scroll down uh on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen. So then it's uh very handy to to scroll down  you make just a rubber just like uh on your mouse or. Just put it on the side and it's very easy to use. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Okay  what's the standard colour? I I You got you got different colours  but you should have a standard colour. Black? With the with the yellow uh Just a regular uh remote colour. And then have uh different covers uh to use. Silver  yeah. You see a lot of t uh silver televisions. Yeah y I think it's better to Yeah th yeah. That's right. But if you use uh silver  uh rubber s silver rubber isn't fancy. When you use titanium  silver is fancy  but when you use silver rubber  it isn't fancy. Silver has to shine  and rubber doesn't shine. Especially when it's made of soft rubber like this. You understand? Yeah. Fruity. Fruity loops. Okay. You ping. Well not what to do. Not what to do. Look. Okay. Thin I think we should work. Thank you very much. ,The marketing expert talked about trendwatching and explained that the current trends are for fruit and vegetable themed products and products with a spongy texture. For users  the three most important aspects of a remote control are a fancy look and feel  technological innovation  and ease of use. The industrial designer talked about the options for energy source  case shape and material  and internal components. The group decided on using kinetic energy  and a double-curved rubber case. The user interface designer talked about speech recognition and what functions will be controlled through buttons or the lcd screen menu. The project manager ran through the group's decisions so far and led a discussion of their remaining options  including the colour of the case and buttons  and whether the remote should flip open or not. 
Okay  well I think we're ready to begin. Right  my name's Adam Duguid  we're here because of real reaction  um  we have in the group Um  yeah  go for it mate. N_ E_ Z_. Ebenezer. And your role is? You're the Marketing Expert  okay. Next we have? T_ R_ I_ K_. And your role in this is? Industrial Designer. And  lastly we have? And you're going to be the User Interface  is it? Designer. Okay. Right. This is the agenda for today's meeting. As you can see  w opening  acquaintance  tool training  project plan discussion  and closing. Um  we already got n through opening  and partially through acquaintance. So  the reason we're here  we're gonna design a new remote control  as you probably all know. The very broad overview is original  trendy  and user-friendly. Course  we'll have to go into a bit more um detail than that  but uh personally I think that the original is gonna be a very key aspect to this design. Um  there's a lot of remote controls out there anyway  so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart. This is how today seems to be going to work. We're gonna have the three kay phases  as you've probably already been told  the functional  architectural  and the detailed design. Um First one's gonna be covering the user requirement spec  technical functions  working design. Second seems to be conceptual components  properties  materials  and the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far. Of course  you've all got the similar emails  I believe  right. What can I say? Ebenezer  you wanna have a you wanna draw your favourite animal? Brilliantly done. Thank you. Tarik  would you like to have a shot at a bit of artistry? Oh  um  you can clip them to your belt. You should also l um have your the lapel mic on as well. Yep  the  it's just across there  that's it. Yep. Yeah. It'll follow you if you You can probably just stick it in your pocket for now  I wouldn't worry too much. Should have good range. Excellent  thank you very much. Dave  if you'd like to uh have a dash. Cheers. Hardly what I'd call the best drawing in the world but it'll do for now. Also not quite as feared as your average tiger  but uh cats are one of my favourite animals  they're very independent  they're snotty as hell at the best of times  and uh  what can you say  you got to love those qualities in an animal. Right. I think we've all managed to master the whiteboard there by looks of it  so  on to it. Project finance. As you can see  twelve point five Euros per unit. That's not a terrible lot as far as I'm aware  and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five. If we're aiming for fifty million Euros we're gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them. Yep. Well  fifty million  and if you're making twelve point five Euros on each one  then  awful lot need to be sold. Okay. Now we better actually just get on with the uh the meat of the project. So I'm gonna guess that we've all used remote controls. Any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market? Okay. Okay  yeah  tha that's true  with the price range we're looking at  going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our yeah. But you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion. Would the the idea something along the lines of  one on button would turn on say the video recorder  the T_V_  maybe the sound system as well  all in one go  is that kind of Okay  that sounds like a a good strong idea. Um Any takes on this? Okay. Okay. Yeah I've heard I've seen the bar-code design before  yeah. Okay  well we're beginning to run out of time now  so  we've got a couple of ideas  we can we'll have to work fast  um  alright as you can see we've got thirty minutes until the next meeting  so we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality  um  how the user interface might work  that'll be a key aspect especially if the idea of um some kind of macros facility because you have to program it  you have to have a lot of response back  or at least some kind. Um And we're gonna maybe n try and have to figure out what the user wants  yes. Um  right. Has anybody got anything they'd like to add at this stage  anything they think that might have been missed so far? I I don't see why not  almost everybody is probably used to a console by now  and all of them incorporate small keypads on them  in fact even the mobile phones these days are beginning to use them as well  so it's probably an interface that most people are used to. Um and that could allow n easy navigation  used as a joystick as well. Okay. So  small  stylish  and something that's just a little different. Okay. That's definitely something that we should be able to do quite easily. I would I would have hoped so anyway. Um  right. I'd say we finish this one up  we get started  I'll get in  I'll write up what we've um kind of quickly done  and I'll get that out to everybody. Yeah? Okay. Um  as far as I'm aware we leave the microphones here  um unless we get told otherwise  and just take the laptops with us. Oh  Ebenezer Ademesoye. Would you like me to spell that? S Um  N_E_Z_ E_R_. I'm the Marketing Expert. Sure. Whiteboard. 'Kay. S okay. I will make this quick  since we don't have much time. Um. 'Kay  so it's not the best picture in the world. Here we have an elephant. First point  begins with an E_  same like Ebenezer. Also  elephants have a very good memory  much like myself  and I can't remember back when I used to live back in Nigeria  but I think I used to have a pet elephant. So elephants are big  strong and gentle  and they have great memories  and they begin with the letter E_  just like Ebenezer. Thank you. Oh. Oh oh I think you ga The little The the Oh that's good  we can clip them on. Okay. Yeah  there was this microphone as well that you Just um somewhere I think so. Yeah. There you go. Oh  that was profiting  that was an amount  so that's the amount made  okay. Yeah. Oh. 'Kay Well um I've noticed that uh gaming c is becoming quite popular with television  um when I was younger we used to e play games using our cable  using the cable subscribed the cable providers  but our remote controls would get worn out really easily  and the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar  um keypad  for playing games. So perhaps one that was more um specialised for game playing or interactive television. They they've recently brought out this new remote control  for people to set their favourite channels  or um to record things. Instead of people entering in what time things start  you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins  and slide another bar to say what time it ends  you know that's Yeah  it's it's taken out the Y you don't have to be uh really clever to use a remote control. I think for gaming  you know you want you want some big buttons for up  down  left and right  shoot. Uh  you wanna be able to change angles in interactive television  so you need buttons to change the television angle  the camera angles and stuff like that. Yeah. What the user wants uh. Okay. Oh. Okay . Mm-hmm. 'Kay. So.. Tarik Rahman. T_A_R_I_K_. Industrial Designer.. Do we take them off? Oh right  okay. Ah-ha. Now where do I put the Is this supposed to be clipped as well? Uh  destroying your elephant here. Uh  here we have a tiger. Uh I've always loved tigers. They're just they're big  they're biggest cats  uh I did a project on cats in the wild when I was a kid and uh it was my favourite cat  just 'cause it was looks the best  the stripes  orange. My dad used to talk about he's from Bangladesh so he used to tell me all about them when he was when I was a kid. And uh they're just the most feared of of uh animals in the wild. So uh that's why I like them. Didn't say an anything about me really but Mm. 'Kay. Well when you're talking about gaming and stuff  do you think they should have some sort of stick on it  rather than buttons? Like uh control pads  you know of games  but or is that a bit ridiculous? Yeah.. Uh  Dave Cochrane. User Interface Defin Designer  yes. Um Um  the monkey  um. The one f uh in fact this is a somewhat oblique reference in fact to uh well my I have a three uh three y year old daughter who h who who who is affectionately known as Miss Monkey. Um  monkeys have attitude. Which I think is a good thing. And I mean fr and from uh from the point of view of sort of the study of human evolution they and other primates are terribly interesting. Um  so I like monkeys. And and th th th th thi thi this one seems to have perhaps more attitude than most. Well  one thing I'm aware of is  th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen L_C_D_ remotes that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models  so you get the sort of you get um you you can redesign the interface to your own needs  you can programme in macros  and you get a much greater degree um um I mean you get in these sort of three in one  five in one  whatevers  but you can get integration between the different uh the the the diff the different things that it's designed to control  to a much greater extent  and you can have one uh you know one macro to turn the uh you know turn the T_V_ to the right channel  get the uh re uh rewind the tape in the V_C_R_ and get it to play once it's rewound  for instance. Um b it occurs to me there might be a niche for uh for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design. And therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket. Absolutely prohibitive  yeah. Yeah  I mean I wouldn't like to say you g I mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units  but something that could um operate between multiple units in a more integrated fashion. Some and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for um running macros. For instance  um let's say oh oh um  or um you know you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the D_V_D_ player and it turns the T_V_ on and onto the right channel as well  um Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. The other key feature that uh that would be a good idea built into it is t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic  something that just fits fits as comfortably as possible into the hand. But of course  uh al al also allows for the possibility of a more sort of slightly unconventional or attractive uh sha shape for it overall . A curve  mm-hmm. Something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form  uh which it would need to be to sort of conform to the shape of the hand more efficiently anyway. ,The meeting begins with the group trying to resolve some equipment issues and waiting for Anna's arrival. Then the project manager introduces the meeting by saying they have some technical tools with which to communicate so they will try to get acquainted with them first. He starts talking about the product they are to design  a remote control which should be original  trendy  and user-friendly. The general outline of the project will be the functional  conceptual  and detailed design. They do some tool training by trying out the whiteboard  and each person draws his/her favorite animal on it. The project manager proceeds to talk about the project finance  which is followed by a group discussion about what functions a good remote control has. This includes the basics such as on/off  channel up/down browsing  volume and record button(s). At this point they clarify their names and roles in the group and then resume talking about remote control functions. They discuss some functions such as a personal video recorder  but say it is probable that they cannot produce a fancy device given their budget. The project manager closes the meeting by telling each group member what he/she will be working on. 
Alright so twenty five. So yeah  I've The only the only remote controls I've used usually come with the television  and they're fairly basic. So uh Mm. But but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features. For sure. Yeah  yeah. Right. Uh  what do we think a What do we think a good size would be for this? 'Cause I I know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky and there's just like a hundred buttons on it  or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily. Right. Okay. Wait for emails? Hmm. Mm 'kay. Mm-hmm. Yeah the universal ones. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm  it's about that. Mm. Um well my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black. As you said they come with the T_V_ so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions  so maybe we could think about colour? Make that might make it a bit different from the rest at least. Um  and as you say  we need to have some kind of gimmick  so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle  you know those things? Because we always lose our remote control. Okay. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Then you lose it  yeah. Kind of um  maybe more like a P_D_A_ kind of  just hand held  like  'cause Yeah. No  I wasn't  no sorry I wasn't thinking of the screen of like a P_D_A_ but Okay. So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said? Yep. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Oh no . Sorry it's okay. Okay  cool. Uh  making a profit of fifty million Euros. So  it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  I was thinking that as well  I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things where they're  yeah. So presumably that might be an idea to put into. Yeah  yeah. Uh 'cause I mean  what uh twenty five Euros  that's about I dunno  fifteen Pounds or so? And that's quite a lot for a remote control. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Okay. The the keyrings  yeah yeah. Okay  that's cool. Okay. Okay. 'Kay. So  we're looking for 'Kay. We're Sorry  carry on. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. For for uh remember we're trying to make it for twelve Euros fifty. Okay well right we'll have to um I'll we're k having another meeting in half an hour so um we should all look into a bit uh  oh actually  no  we'll allocate. So you do the looking around at other remote controls. Um  if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever  and you could look into um basically how how it's made I_E_ like how you make it all in one  how what sort of materials are available to you whatever. And obviously  other instructions will come from the personal coach. Which will probably just usurp what I said so Shapes and colours and um basically how to make it attractive. Uh. And you look at competition and design. Cool. So we have uh Um. Okay  groovy. And no doubt we'll get um Sorry. We'll get um warnings for next meetings as well. Okay. I shall I can't imagine these are worth much. Okay. Fashion into electronic. Okay. Slim. Uh yeah uh  being as a Marketing Exper Expert I will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market? What are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices? What speciality other remote controls are having and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market. So before deciding or before finalising this project  we must discuss all these things  like and apart from this  it should be having a good look also  because people really li uh like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their C_D_ player  M_P_ three player like any electronic devices. They really want to have something good  having a good design in their hands  so  yes  all this. Yeah. Yep. Uh. Hmm. ,The Project Manager presented the goals of the meeting and new product requirements. The Industrial Designer presented the internal components of a remote control and showed a diagram of how they operate together. He suggested that field programmable gateway arrays be used for the chip controlling software functionalities  and it was suggested that the remote be used with a recharging stand. The User Interface Designer gave a presentation on the technical functions of the remote  and displayed the interfaces of two existing products for comparison. He showed that the competitors' remotes were too complicated. He suggested that the televisions that the remotes are used with connect to the internet to access downloadable programs. He suggested a simple design with few buttons  small size  and a locator function. The Marketing Expert presented several characteristics important to users. He discussed using speech recognition and ways to make it feasible for the project  small size  low price point  and incorporating teletext in different languages. The group discussed the new requirement that required them to omit teletext from their design  and discussed the possibility of using the remote to access the internet through the television. 
Yeah. Yeah. Oh. But people are often enough looking at the help  once they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated stuff. It's a psychology. Okay. And let us see what the market demands. We could just go to my presentation. Yeah that's right. I mean it just showed us the remote with an cap which could be used for kids and if you remove the Same remote with some Both yeah. And then we can decide what what we can yeah. So we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes and how it could be special from the other remotes. And we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires. Uh we also have some prizes for the most creative solutions. And we found the following solutions which we could which would be helpful for our design. So seventy percent of the users  they find their remote controls very ugly  they don't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything. And eighty percent of the people they are always l I mean they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy. And the current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user. And seventy five percent of the users said they zap a lot. And fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons  so the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons they're not used most of the times. So this were the findings which we found. And also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls. Most of fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room and people are always searching for them rather than watching the T_V_. And by the time they found the remote control the program is finished. So they're frustrated a lot And um if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it. So you can just see the percentage  fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes and thirty four percent they say that it's quite difficult to learn if it's too complex. So keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations I think this should be the solution for them. We should have an L_C_D_ on the rem remote control. Mm-hmm? I mean as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy. So if we have a L_C_D_ on the remote  rather than looking onto the T_V_ you just look into a remote and navigate it. It's the same menu as we have saw that iPod remote control. We just play around Yeah. Yeah. I mean this were the points which we got from the market demands. So the other one Yeah that's fine. Yeah. I mean that's Mm-hmm. Uh yeah we have uh I mean that should be found out by the Industrial Designers. And it's always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls. Yeah it's o only for a limited vocabulary  say eighty commands or so. Mm  the scroll button  from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button. Because they they just they're just frightened to use the scrollings or help button. Yeah. They're not used much. Or it could be like this  as the people say  if they have a L_C_D_ on the remote not on the television. Because when you have the L_C_D_ onto the television screen you miss the picture in the background  we are most focused on the commands. So if you have then L_C_D_ in the remote  you just have a menu  and increasing and lower these signs here to change the programs and this menu when you press the menu  in the L_C_D_ displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume  then the program  then the brightness  contrast and all the stuff. And accordingly you can just increase or decrease. Yeah that has to be checked out. Yeah. Okay. I mean  better if we could just check all the cost with L_C_D_ and also with the speech recognition. And then we could find which would would be a more suitable in this case. And the third problem was to find the remote control. Always  so fifty percent of the people say they lose the remotes. So Yeah that's right  that's exactly what I mean by voice commander. Or it could be also something like this  uh it's always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control  so we have some one charger there and whenever we don't use the remote control we put it in the charger. And when we're using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere  in the charger we have a small button  and just by pressing the button in the charger the uh remote control beeps  wherever it is. I mean it doe it also doesn't require a voice command  because there are problems with a voice command. Yeah  yeah  yeah. I mean charger would be fixed because it's always with electricity plugged. Yeah that's right. It's an good reminder  yeah that's right. And of course the final point is a fancy look. As we have seen earlier the remotes which were displayed by Norman they weren't fancy  I mean mm very big or something with lot of buttons. I think we should have something it I mean uh I mean uh I mean uh you see if it's like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and use it  you can't avoid him. But you can have an button for child lock. So just by pressing the button with some code  you t you put a lock onto the remote  so that he can't use even Mm uh That's right. I think these other four points they're the market demands and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think Yeah I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh these could be included. No  we have a problem there. You see uh if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on uh basketball score or something  and if the score comes twenty four thirty five  you've just say twenty five and suddenly the screen the channel goes to twenty five. So I think there should be a prefix to some numbers I mean the the you just check all the probability that saying T_V_ twenty five and just ordinary twenty five. Ordinary twenty five you almost there's a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent and T_V_ twenty five I dunno it will be round about one or two percent. So it's better to have some prefix before the number. Yeah something  some code. That will be too big. And it will be difficult for the vocabulary also. Als might be you just forgot the channel name  you kno only know the number. Then Yeah  the. Yeah yeah . Yeah. A and in the same lines we would have a one more problem. If we are using the television in the different environments  say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work  that would bring a bad name bad uh reputation for our company. So I think we should specify some pre-requirements if we want to use a voice commands  say that it should be used in an silent homely environment or s something. Yeah that's right that should be an option. I think these are the practical problems. So we need to take care of them in the design. Okay. Oh it came there on three minutes back so we are I think we can just press the okay. Okay. See you another thirty minutes. Okay so I think I will do my presentation on the components concept so can you please uh open uh I'm participant two. Components design. Okay so uh the first thing uh I have done is to to made a review together with the uh manufactural uh department and have which components was uh available to build a remote control. So for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy  hand dynamo and uh kinetic um well uh kinetic uh technique to to store the energy. We also um we also can put a regular battery in the in the remote control. Now Yeah b uh f well uh I meant uh by by battery I meant uh I will not have a uh a wire between the remote control and the energy source but uh I didn't fou we didn't decide yet which kind of battery we will put inside the the remote. So uh it's a point to discuss. Then uh the case material we have uh uh also several choices  like wood  rubber  titanium or latex. But uh well it's not a a re uh well a real issue for the from the technical uh point of view. Concerning the interface uh we can we can put mm just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons uh much more complicated  but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so. And uh this is the last point  the choice of chips. So what I have f found is that I think basic battery or kinetic uh energy uh collection is the is the better way to provide energy because I think solar energy wi won't work in a cluttered uh uh environment. So um so I think we can start with these two main things. For the case uh well uh I think that uh titanium is um is a good choice because it's trendy and it's uh it's uh well it's modern and uh user are are are mm will be uh very happy to have a a a nice remote. For the interface uh I think that we can ach achieve uh all the desired functionalities by s just uh using uh rubber buttons  simple buttons and th thus this allow to use a regular chip that are uh well cheaper. And s so uh we can move to the next slide. Yeah. Well uh uh i i it's uh it's the the shape of the um of the remote. You you will have the well um the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the Yeah. It's more confog f comfortable that if these uh it's completely flat. Yeah the um that's the point. The kinetic one is uh y you can recharge uh by the um Yeah and by well by just by moving the ar uh your arm the mm well the remote will uh accumulate energy. But I d I don't know it's if it is feasible because I don't know if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote um all the necessary energy. Yeah. And yeah and so can you go to the next slide please. So and uh that's uh that summarize well what I have said. So uh you're right we can uh see in our uh R_ and D_ uh if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy. That's it. Oh yeah I take care  it's all right. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm mm mm. Yeah fine. Yeah. S a good idea. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah but uh as Norman say if uh there is uh already a commercial product available who t who do this we we can check uh to integrate it i into our uh new remote control. Yeah yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Well I I think you it's it's it's fine you have uh reviewed all all the possibilities but uh uh well uh i if we consider that uh the user interface is displayed on the T_V_ screen I don't think we nee uh we need much buttons in the remote since we we just have to navigate and to have a okay or enter key or things like that  because uh adding wheels or scrolls uh makes the thing more complicated and more expensive also  so. Yeah. That's a good idea. To have a help button. Yeah. On the T_V_ screen. On the T_V_ screen the uh how to use your remote. Uh yeah. In a marketing point of view. But uh wel well I think Uh well. So le le let's see what uh what people want. Yeah. Yeah. Mm  the functionalities yeah. Yeah. Well mm w well I I I don't really see the advantage of having uh L_C_D_ on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and uh display on the screen. It's yeah of course it's fancy trendy and so on but it's it's expensive to produce and it's not really Yeah. Yeah yeah. Yeah but when you play with the iPod you don't have a big screen in front of you  s Yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah. So I th I I well I think we we can focus on the uh on the fancy look on the uh on the speech recognition if the technology is available but well I think L_C_D_ will uh will uh make us spend a lot of money for not so big results. So price of uh L_C_D_ display. And Yeah. Yeah okay. And Well uh compared to the to s the simpl simpler simplest button. Yeah. Yeah I think that Yeah I I I think that uh well uh as we have seen in the in the presentation uh well uh about uh uh fifty percent of the of the percent n choose the button so uh I think to have uh five uh simple button is sufficient for our functionality. Yeah. But But the uh the thing is is i is that we can add a functionality on the on the T_V_ screen like uh a a list of function and then you choose with the with the button to well you navigate and you Yeah. But if i i if we if we could have a a a display uh g a user interface that is very complete on the T_V_ screen I think that just five buttons are sufficient  one to go up left right down and uh enter and you you you just select the functionality you want to access or things like that. You don't have to to switch to a channel to another uh Yeah but Yeah but if you look at the L_C_D_ you you don't look at the T_V_ screen so i i it's not really worth to get to have the image if you don't look at  so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like uh find and when the remote control uh hears fine well yeah just uh to make him beep or t Yeah. Yeah. Put Yeah. And that's a good idea  that's simple  like in phones. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah if there if there uh there is nuff not enough battery. Also and uh uh the remote is lost. Yeah. Okay. They were ugly. They Well the last one with the um yeah with the two parts was uh original  so Yeah. Yeah. Well we can think about uh having uh on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the T_V_ you can uh well write a code or choose a category  if it is kids  uh things like that. So for mm yeah. So for my part I will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use  where to use  and s uh and so on. Yeah. Yeah. Well I think we can we can have just numbers for channels and you can say to your remote control like uh sports and then on the T_V_ you have a list with with uh uh well with sports program playing now and and uh That's right  yeah  yeah. Well but well e every possible word uh has a probability to come about of the T_V_ so. Yeah yeah. Yeah but well okay. Yeah yeah. Mm mm. Well I Yeah. Well I uh I also I I also think about uh another problem  if if there is uh more than one person who is watching T_V_ the s well the the speech uh r recogniser should be able to distinguish between the two. Because uh I remember when I was a young child with my sister we yeah we always want to w to watch different emission at the at the same time so it's a pr it could be a problem if uh if well if someone passes by when you are watching T_V_ and say oh T_V_ thirty and just run  s Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Yeah that's well I think that's a good uh a good option because it's simple and uh simple to implement also  so. Okay. Okay. So I see ya. Mm. Mm. Mm. Sorry. What is this single curved what does it mean? So it's it's not Yo l yeah. When you hold on it  it is comfortable to hold. Okay. Yeah. And the battery  is it kind of a rechargeable or it doesn't matter? That that's what it means by kinetic. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm. Mm. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. We we might check with our R_ and D_ department to see if they have this product ready for market. Mm mm. Wha Ah the department. Mm. Uh So I um keep in touch with the R_ and D_ department. So the titanium case is the normal case that I'll show you some pictures that I have and you tell me whether they are titanium case or not. 'Cause I am not very sure  plastic  titanium or whatever. There's another point I want to make  is that the uh well you've seen them I le na my presentation that um I point out some why buttons are not the mm not the only ways you can use Yeah. Yeah  maybe n Yeah. So the user interface is uh i it uses the aspect uh of a computer system  a programme which can be seen or heard or otherwise perceived by the human user and the commands and mechanism the user uses to control its operation and input data. So you s this gives you the ways to input data and we have uh we are more we emphasise more on the graphical user interface here. The idea is to represent buttons as figures  diagrams  symbols and on so you you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing. Yeah. Yeah. So. Ea easy to use. So next one. function five. So I can use the button  the mouse maybe. Yeah. So next line. So the here are some examples. So they cluster the buttons together. They group them into col they colour them and uh they have different forms as well. Mm but this interface are kind of confusing. Uh basically there are too many buttons. Right. Next one. So some people are propose voice recognition and so ah by the way I receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine for this by a company when you tell the you say good morning coffee machine and the machine are reply to you. So I just got an email saying that. And it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used so we might consider that  supposedly. The next one. Mm so somebody some people use uh some people use a spinning wheel th with the L_C_ display so instead of using the mm buttons you have a L_C_D_ screen and then there you can u you can use that as buttons  you can use that as real so so that could be an option as well. Touch screen  I mean. Next one. And some people propose a scroll button. Integrated with push buttons or you may have scroll button instead of p just the push button. Like the one we have here. Uh  next one. So mm so there are a few aspects that I collected here. So s basically this deals with special users  children  handicapped people  old people  and uh mm and prog basically they are programmable  specially for children. And uh mm yeah yeah. And then they also secure uh covers  to protect uh secure and hidden programming and battery covers that will protect your settings. So But we don't have to integrate all these complicated features. I'm just saying that the currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f customisable for different people. Yeah  so that's the point. The next one. And uh you see this is the one where you have the protection cover. Mm maybe useful for children  they migh you you they only see the buttons outside. And for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside. So the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside. Yeah. The next one. So this guy this is another company that provides big buttons. At I see that that is useful for old people and then you don't get it lost. But for our product we don't need a big one because you have voice recognition e eventually with use. And you can call your remote controller if you don't know where it is. T_V_ remote controller where are you? And then  he will beeps and to say that I am here  for example. Is it possible? Uh? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And uh  this is another one where you can uh the the the part that's a V_ standing for the volume. So there's a up arrow and a down arrow. But you the see that in the V_  the V_ appears to be the down arrow on the top on the top up arrow if you up arrow there's a V_ like as as if it's turning down so it's confusing interface  so I wanna avoid this kind of thing in the design. And here are is uh here is a s short summary that I summary that I compiled after the findings I found. Big buttons are convenient  voice recognition helps  push buttons  scroll buttons  spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools. And uh user customisable is important and finally simplicity simplicity is the key. Yeah. So we have many concepts there but we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used. And basically uh Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Okay. A help button. So you are display on the screen. So on the T_V_ screen. Okay. Okay. Okay. So that eliminates all the complicated documentation  okay. So wi Yeah. Mm. Mm. Well uh what I s propose is that uh you know a remote controller  i it could be a cube  is uh a small device that uh looks like a cube and maybe you can just change the um the buttons  if you ch turn one side you get one one buttons  you turn the other side you get the other buttons  so for maybe new generation people who get used to the computer they want lots of controls. Small Yeah. Let's see the market demand. What what market yes yes. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Mm. Oh. Big screen. Yeah. Mm yeah. Mm. The thing Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If you re-use the existing screen  we element eliminate the L_C_D_  after all the L_C_D_ just to display and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful  fancy  as fancy as the one on the L_C_D_  maybe even better. So Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. More on a fancy design. Yeah. Mm. Remember we have a s budget for the cost of producing the remote controller. Yeah. So i is so the thing is you can find out how much an L_C_D_ will cost and then we'll decide again. Uh maybe you can find out the price and tell us next time. Is i if i Yeah. Yeah. And also the cost for the speech recognition. Ask our R_ and D_ department. Yeah. Yeah. And ho Yeah. And also the scroller button  how much will it cost. Yeah. Don't use the buttons. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Important. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah  yeah. So so the at most more power uh. Yep. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. I if Mm. Mm. Yeah. I think that there's no contradiction here  because if there are few buttons  you don't have to look at your your controller any more because you know where the buttons are  so if you wanna control the screen d sh sharpness you just say sharpness and then you t turn you just press lef increase or decrease button and the same for the volume and the channel  if you had the speech recognition there you just shout your channel  just tell your channel and then you don't even have to look at the butto at the controller so finally that wil eliminates the the need for L_C_D_  with the help of speech recogniser you can Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah. A and Mm. Where  yeah. Yeah. Mm. Put it back at the charge. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Hmm. Mm. Th yeah. Mm yeah. Yeah. Mm. Mm. There's mm. Mm. Yeah. That we can what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off T_V_ button  the off button  the remote there be s uh instruction on the screen  please charge charge me. You never get it lost because uh every time you're off the computer the T_V_ you are asked the the command the T_V_ com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where to the charger. Yeah. So you will never get lost yeah. Yeah. Yeah because everything is programmed inside. So it's it's uh it's all about strategy  y Mm. Mm. Yeah  yeah. With uh two two two parts controller. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. these are probl yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. I think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser because uh if you want uh say we can sort by channels or sort by T_V_ programs  you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them. If numbers  they're easy  but if name the channel by by name Mm. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. But I I I think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers. You say numbe channel number five of the T_V_ correspond to something else in the channel. So some people may want to say  I want to see this channel. Yeah. Check with the v R_ and D_ department the capability of recogniser. Uh? Well  it's convenient for the user. The uh uh mm. Mm. I I think that I have mm mm I think there's another way you can do is that uh you can uh if when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example  then what you can do is that the you can make the T_V_ screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel  so let's say it's a four by four matrix of the images  so now what you do is f looking at the all the sixteen channels available at one time  you just use the control button uh  you just you you just choose the the option you want and then you just hit the button and then you go to that channel. So Mm. So you you don't use the speech recogniser in that way. Oh  okay. Yeah. Mm. Yeah  I wanna watch this  I wanna watch that. Mm. Mm. Mm. Hmm. Well  you you stay a five minutes. So we come to the third meetings. I have good. Um so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design. So we will talk about some specific details. This Uh this is what we have decided in the last meeting. But if we use battery We will  okay. Three. What's the function of this button. I think it makes the the interface really Graphical user interface. A graphical user interface emphasise the use of pictures. Yeah. Mm-hmm. We should include speech synthesis in this case  no? Mm-hmm. Or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control and we should have just a button like help and you say uh and you ik you press the button help and maybe you see the the user m might in the in the T_V_. Yeah. On T_V_ T_V_ screen. So just you push the button and we will Yeah. If the if No In the case where they need help  in the case where they need help. Yeah. It's just for user customizable  for kids or old people. So So it's the same Can be used by both kids and old people. Maybe for kids  kids they like uh t no l they like to Yeah. Mm-hmm. You can use this screen instead of the big se screen  instead of use the yeah. Hmm. But Yeah. Mm. It's for it's just for small vocabulary. We it's not yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Push push. It doesn't mean that the other buttons are not necessary or important. But they are just less used compar yeah. Or maybe we can u uh or maybe we can uh make this the ten percent of button more bigger than the others. So. Mm. It's And I think it's increases the cost of the the remote control if you use L_C_D_. I You will listen to a peep  special peep. Okay. Yeah. But you don't you don't have to move the the charger. You have to keep it. Okay. Maybe for some people lazy people. Yeah yeah. Mm. Or Or maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids and then just just yeah just push uh kids button so it's automatically. So if he. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah it's yeah. Mm-hmm. Or just It's difficult to to just say the the name of the channel. It will be difficult to say just the name of the channel. Because you have to s t uh a ch yeah but you have to to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary. Or maybe Or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary  just pronouncing the the name of channels and include in the vocabulary. Or lets the user create his own vocabulary of channel. No. Just you have uh in the beginning you have uh t you have to train you have to create the vocabulary by yourself. By associating each channel with the name or And for each one has his own. Or you have to s Yeah. Mm. Or we can switch on or switch off the the special  yeah. Maybe we'll discuss them in next meeting. It's time to close this meeting. Yeah. Okay. Thanks for your collaborations. ,The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team members and discussed the roles of each member and the selling price for the remote they will produce. Then the team participated in an exercise in which they all drew animals. 
Hello. Make a start yeah. So. Cable  camera. Should be in my in their folder no? Up. Um at three I think. No? Mm. Do we think w s in the in the wrong folder maybe? It is possible. It was somewhere in something like this. I don't remember the name actually must be something like messenger AMI or something. Go up. Yeah go up. Again. No. Go back. Uh maybe messenger AMI. Messenger. No. There is nothing. Let's go and check. I'll go and check. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So uh. Basically what we want here is a remote control right. So um the question well first of all what to control. So most people want to have a a remote for their hi-fi and T_V_ and stuff like that. And but other people want th also remotes for controlling uh and toys like robotic pets and little robots and stuff and other people also want to have remotes for controlling um whole house. Yeah  so there's a project I think called X_ house or something like that that does that  uh you can integrate your remote with uh computers stuff. So there is one that is one thing. The other is the the finder feature yeah by whistling or whatever. Uh if you have the finder feature then you can also have uh at the same time as and general voice commands if you want yeah. So I think it should be a package in that case. Uh so the user interface will consist of two parts. One is the voice command part and on one is the actual buttons part. Uh and th the buttons part would be uh a set of buttons for choosing devices  a set of buttons for special navigation in space  a set of buttons for linear access of medium and a set of buttons for random access. Yeah? Like a video tape goes forward  backwards  uh fast and stuff yeah. Um. Mm? Yeah. For special navigation for example you might have a T_V_ in the menu and you going to change yeah? Uh. Mm. Yeah and also parameter changing. So if there are common parameters maybe we should put special buttons for that um or maybe we could have everything uh generic but uh there are a lot of uh remotes on the market right now and basically this is most of the almost everybody has this stuff. Voice command w we could specify anything. We could assign any button a command to any button  if we have enough processing power  I guess so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh yeah I think so. Not so far. Where did you put it? mm. I'm designing the user interface. But what kind of remote controls did you look at? What kind of task was it? It was a T_V_? Huh. Uh-huh. Ah! Good. Other side yeah  yo wa your wrist. It i can become painful you can have tendonditis. Yeah. If you also up on a computer in a strange position. Ergonomic. But uh. Have to say ha ha. Mm-hmm. The first question. Mm. Mm. Mm I it's not true I think. The the second claim that you put. Yeah. I think that should be the same. I have uh I've no idea I mean I should know a bit more about how fast we can uh design it. I don't think Uh yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Like a you feel a bit like a dog with this stuff. This will think this will take more time to develop also. Yeah. Soon. Yeah. So the only time problem is the sp voice recognition. Yeah. Yeah. Ten years. But we don't have time to market. I think we should contact management. Well. Uh How muc how much do you get how much do you if you buy one million units h no  one hundred thousand units. Eh chips. We're gonna need chips right. Yeah. How much will it cost for one hundred thousand? Okay. So you have any idea for a powerful one that has uh good enough for do speech recognition. Yeah? Okay. So. No it doesn't. Okay. Four million. Mh-hmm. A a lot of people are uh if you have the L_C_D_ screen if you can do it completely the way you want because the buttons also look the way you want them but it will be hard to configure I mean imagine i uh so it's really something for the expert user. So I mean there are markets and markets. I think the young people are th uh are uh Christine here said uh you have a uh it is yeah. So for our young people uh it will be cool  they can be able to use it. Th maybe their parents will not but they will configure it. I guess. I don't know if there is study about that. Mm. And there are another thing is that if we make something that's simple and easy to use that's bas to use immediately that means that it will be exactly the same as everything else. All right? Otherwise  if it's different then of course everybody has somebody has to learn to use it first. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But teletext is just one button. You you just write the write the numbers. So will you add with the channel keys  right? So. I am. I'm sure that uh it don't like but uh I don't see just one button. So. Mm-hmm. Capital. Well if it is going to be just a T_V_ remote control it is going to be very simple. Well if it's going to be as simple as possible then just have the remote control  there is no other function that I can see really. Uh no you want to keep television on so that the advertising can revenue can come back to us. Or something. It's a memory  yeah. And uh and of course the channel changing buttons. How should they how should we implement that? Because uh could be numerical only or could be also incremental. Mm-hmm. Mm. It's an interesting idea  that if you press it for a long time it does something else  in general. So if you you have your ten buttons for the for the numeric the numerical buttons and you have instead of having just one memory you have if you press them for a long time No. Doesn't work does it. Maybe we should have a complete keyboard and just type console commands. Change channel to eight. No. Well if it's useful like if if you want to change between three channels for example then you h you cannot you cannot cannot work with just memory being incremental. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah when you zap usually you will have to press the same button all the time and Yeah. Mm-hmm. Hey I just thought this thing there is a I mean you know there is are some with a wheel like this. Instead of having the up down buttons for uh you can have the wheel. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. On the lower side I think it you have to turn it. No? If we do that. Yeah. Because of that Because it's uh it's it's not like a volume which is smooth yeah? The channels change one by one. So you have to the user has to like to should feel the the the discrete sense a bit. Yeah. Yeah. Even if i L_E_D_ uh or a if if it's the L_C_D_ feature uh whatever  yeah. Yeah. I think it's only put on if cou have multi function. If you do not multi function then there is no p point in having L_C_D_. Just increase the cost. The user does not have an advantage really. Well if it's going to delay yeah but uh it will be cool. It would. Because a user could say C_N_N_ for example and it would go C_N_N_. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. What is the folder that you put yours in? And did it it did work? Ah yeah. Mm. Okay. Okay what is your email? At participant one. Okay. Well during lunch break actually. So next time we should have a fight. How about uh management or something. Who happens to be your friend. Okay. F do you want to start? Okay. No. What do you have in short cut? Participant two. Yeah. Otherwise  could you just describe by hand? With the the whiteboard? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. What do you mean by linear access then? Ah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I'm just thinking of some thing. Um We want to have a no  I don't know if this is a good idea. We want to have a a general remote control for everything. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah. Yeah. No no. Finish tonight. But basically yeah maybe I can continue with my presentation  it would be al you you but I think we have some technical problem or so. So I'm just going to describe briefly what we do in the remote control. If fact Yeah but Do I have oh yeah. Now I have enough cables. Okay so I'm just going to describe in fact for for a remote control this is quite easy. We just have sorry  I'm going Like that. I'm just going to describe. Basically we have a a battery a power supply here. After that we just have um user interface. Let's say that um something like that  which could be um a L_C_D_ let's say or um an array of push button  something like that. Push button or a L_C_D_. After that we we feed that into um uh an electronic chip. So I say U_C_ and I feed that to uh L_E_D_ which is uh infrared um which is a an infrared um component. And so what we for for myself this for for us this is quite easy. Yeah. Y it's a it's this just a chip which does all the um numerical numerical computation according to your display. And so for us uh this is quite easy. We just need to take to define what we want to do when the user interface um wants something and after that we just do the coding to s and send that to to to the not the to the television. So for us this is quite easy. Yeah. Um we just have to define the processing power that we need uh especially if we want to do some uh speech recognition  in that case that mean that we are going to use more for simple Yeah of course of course. And um but for a standard one this is really easy. It's a question of one month and so on s No no no no  I say yeah standard uh standard remote control takes maybe uh one month to to do that. Yeah. Definitely. I would say. I would say uh about eight months to have the first results. Yeah. I can Um. Yeah. Yeah even. I mean that this is really standard devices now. Um eight. For uh speech recognition. And also how much uh I think during the kickoff meeting you say that we we shouldn't we shouldn't go up to twelve point five Euro per unit so how many units should we sell to have a Yeah but how many yeah. Yeah. Usually this is less tha at two dollars per chip. Yeah  we can Mm-hmm. Um I just had a question uh do you want to continue with your presenta? Is it Um you say that I don't remember by heart but thirty per cent of the tested people say that's it's quite difficult to to to use the remote control. Do they say that this is difficult but for the same reason or do they have other reason? To to maybe to keep in mind maybe to access to that menu you should do something like that. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And But yeah maybe and what about if we design a remote control which can be configure as you want? You say that I want  I have six button Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Uh I know that som you say that many people are doing plenty of a lot of zapping. I know tha I discovered that when I did a quick look  uh they do now som they do something which is quite nice now  you have a button  you you press it  and this is uh the previous channel which has come back. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Let's say that we can do something like that. This is uh incremental  but once you press it for a long time  you go five by five. To go fa to go faster. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Or we can do something like that. We can design the remote control to have access. You know some remote control have uh protection and so you you y You Yeah  a kind of joystick. Mm-hmm. Or a or a ball  yeah  not a a wheel but a ball  and you say uh to Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  the yeah. 'S quite it's quite easy we do that w with back light on the on the wheel. A blue a blue L_E_D_ and we sell that um. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Ten years Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay. Mm. Yeah. Um I dunno if you can open the uh m is not here. Uh in yeah okay. No. In document. Mm computer yeah. Here. Here. But it's not Um. Mm-hmm. Yeah  I can do that. Okay. Um. It's participant one? Okay. You can uh. Yeah. Okay so you can you can go. Okay so in our usability lab we observed the remote control use among one hundred subjects and the subjects also filled a questionnaire okay? And here I have the results so you can see that um seventy five per cent of users find most remote controls ugly so we have to find something to make them more more nice  more kind. Eighty per cents of users would spend more money when the remote control would look fancy. Eighty hundred per cent of users would spend more money when the remote control would look oh to it's not good. So okay. So it's not in theory but I I can I can say yeah. Fifty f uh seventy five per cent of users say they s zap a lot. So mm we have to have a remote control uh very um out for that. Uh the buttons have are to be um uh uh like you say resist resisting to to shocks. Um and fifty per cents of users say they only use uh ten per cents of but of the buttons in the in the remote control. So all the buttons we we have to put are have to to have um a use a real use and not only or Yeah. F not many buttons  and uh and uh uh u useable buttons. Sorry? Yeah. Uh most for most is T_V_. 'Kay you can go so. So there are other frustrations expressed by users  so they said uh they lost uh often the remote control in in the room so they want to have a way to to to find it. Um and um lot of the time they it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control. So they want something s really very simple and uh easy to use. And uh remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ um I dunno. Yeah. Uh. Okay um before that I I have some some some thing uh to say before um We know that uh the user use uh a lot their um remote control um to to change channel. Um and um to to change uh volume selection of the and uh and not uh a lot for setting for setting the the channels and uh thing things like that. So it's better to put uh uh uh something very easy to set and uh and Very accessible yes. That's right. So then we asked some questions to them and um we asked this question if they prefer an L_C_D_ screen or on their remultific function remotes control and if they mm pay more for speech recognition in remote control and you can go we have here the results of of the questions. So you know that um for the younger it's very important to have the s yes and speech recognition. And uh and the others is not so important but uh we know that uh uh people between fifteen and twenty five are people who watch a lot T_V_ and uh who who wh can use a lot this uh. So maybe we we can have a speech recognition in. Yeah. Mm. Okay and if there is th the conclusion now. So as we say before  I think uh um a remote control lightening in the dark it's it's a good thing. Uh not to many mud buttons like we we said before  e easy to use uh a way to find it easily in the room and uh uh resistant to to shock and to to An I s no  yeah. I dunno if you see something else important or Mm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm? Yeah. Oh. Would j Uh yeah w I I think they they say that it's uh difficult to learn how to use it but i when you know how to use it  it's it's okay. But Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. No. No no. I dunno  I dunno it. 'Kay thank you. Okay everyone's ready. So we are here for uh for uh functional design. Okay? So we are here for the functional design meeting mm so first I will show the agenda so we will uh I will take notes during this meeting so I will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards so then uh each of you will uh lead a presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification  technical function design and working design. Then I will uh present you some new project requirements I received from uh the management board. Then we will take uh the decision on on the remote control uh needed functions and then I will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting. Of the of the process. So uh who want to start the the presentation of what they did? You can start. You have uh PowerPoint? Ah yeah maybe there. Okay. Who are you? Ouch. And We have a technical problem uh. You put it on Yeah. You have no Over. Okay. There's no We have a technical problem. If you remember yeah but that's Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay so special navigation  linear access  random access and there's a fourth one no? So the better now for special navigation? Okay. Then linear access then random access. Ah yeah parameter okay. Okay. Okay. Okay and and voice command did you uh Okay. Okay. Okay. So that's uh that close your investigations? Okay. Okay. Maybe we can have a look at the user requirements with I dunno if I can open it. Maybe you can s It's Messenger no? In which folder? Short-cut to AMI shared folder? Maybe you can send it to me by email. Just to participant one. At AMI. I will try to show it to everyone  that would be more comfortable. You send it? Yeah. Uh this is this email. Okay. So maybe I can switch slides when you whenever you ask  that will be more convenient. So okay  functional requirements. Mm. Yeah. We can just keep doing that? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay  so fewer buttons maybe would be good? Okay. Yeah. Yeah but in fact we it it seems that we are going to make a T_V_ remote control according to new requirements I received from the management bo I will present them in the following. Okay. Yeah. To find it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. What is her other side? Oh yeah? I did not knew that. Okay so you we have to make it uh more ergonomic yeah. It's your job Oh. Uh sorry got a message from Microsoft. Yeah. Yeah yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. This function should be very uh accessible. Yeah  okay. This is the main function okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. To have L_C_D_ and voice. Okay. Yeah maybe this this is important. Moreover th maybe those uh like those teenager customer could advice their parents to buy this equipment and so we can we have to take care of that point of view I think or so. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay these are the user requi Yeah. No no no. We w it seems that we no want to have a T_V_ remote control. From the management board I receive an email. Cos it would be costly uh and and also it it would take more time to develop to have a a general generic remote control. That it would be too long to develop. Oh yeah. Because I received that email from management board and they seems to tell that that if we want to be on the market as early as possible we should uh focus on T_V_ more where it seems that the market is more important. So maybe it's a good decision. I dunno. What's your opinion? Okay. Maybe you can go to the whiteboard if you have some drawings to do I don't know. Okay. Are you okay? U_C_ is the central unit? Okay yeah. Computation. Okay. Okay. Okay so this is quite easy. There is not that much constraints. To have a you s you speak about with voi voice control? Standard button one. So do you have any idea of how long it would take to have voice recognition now? Okay so i it's a bit long yeah. One month for the standard one with button. Even if we have a L_C_D_ display? Okay yeah. Okay so we can take this into account. So who think it would be good to go for uh like speech recognition? Yeah it will. Euros. Yeah  yeah. Well each unit is is sell uh twenty five Euros. Because we are It seems that that we want to sell like four million units from the first meeting. Okay. Maybe we can uh we can look at the new requirement I receive from the management board and discus discuss all function we want to have. Yeah I I will continue. Well ask your question if you want. Okay. It's not intuitive first. Yeah. But  but also it seems that Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe it would be more complex to configure it to be simple than creating a simple product. Yeah. But also we we see that that most people find it find remote controls too complex because they have too many buttons and they mainly use only channels and volume buttons. So we may just uh make a very easy to use remote control with mainly those buttons and maybe also um some lightning stuff too because most people find also hard to to find the remote control. Losed lose it etcetera. These these are these two points are the main frustrations so maybe if we design something very simple and easy to uh find when lost it will uh add uh a serious competitive advantage without making something too complex and too long to develop. So but le let us see first the new requirement. So we don't have to so this this uh is uh is um in the this is in the same direction as we were speaking so we don't have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and stuff like that Yeah but then you have to you have to define the buttons to surf amongst pages and stuff. Yeah. So well Yeah. So anyway we don't have to include this feature because it's it's not used any more by users  they prefer to s Yeah. I dunno. If i one button is still one more button. If if if we want to make it very simple we have to reduce number of buttons compared to th to our competitors. Well anyway I have this point. We can discuss. Also um so as as I told before uh it would be better if it's only for the T_V_ um because we want to be quick on on the market. And then also we have to make very uh uh clear that this uh this remote control is is part of of our products and show our corporate uh logo and and colours on the on the design as well so that uh they identify it as one of our product. So this is the the key point. So before uh finishing we can uh define uh what would be the characteristic of the o th of the control of the remote control and which button do we need which function do we want etcetera. So do you um so so from from the the Marketing Expert I think a key aspect is the easy to use aspect  it should be very simple and most button are never used only ten per cent of the button are are used often so I think we have to do something very simple and I think we all agree on that point  no? Yeah okay. So yeah the key point here is simple. Maybe. So few buttons  channel  volume control and what el what function do you see in addition to that? Yeah. Maybe switch T_V_ on and off Yeah. Yeah. Volume  maybe a mute button  and then on off button. And that's all? Mm. Okay. Yeah this is cool. Maybe we can include that also. Previous previous channel button. So we have like channel button  the previous channel button  the volume button  plus a mute button  and uh just the the traditional on off button. Yeah. I I talk about that  yeah? Yeah. Incremental definitely because zapping you you switch them. We go faster? Mm. Maybe we should have also a digit button Yeah. Maybe we have also to have digits or only incremental. I dunno bec because if you have the Uh. Yeah. Because you have your previous channel button if you have incremental only it's not uh it isn't worth it because the previous channel is eith either minus one or plus one. So I think we need also digits. Maybe we we can make very obvious the channel and volume button button and smaller button down there with the the digits. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe we can have a wheel for incremental. Okay. So have a wheel for incremental  have the digits uh on the lower side that can be closed so as you say protected  and uh yeah I think this is the basi And do we do we have a No  a wheel is better. I would say the wheel is better. What is the expert of uh Okay. Yeah. That's a good idea. Well also we have to decide uh so it should be lightening in the dark I think because most people lost their remote control. Okay. Yeah  and do we put an L_C_D_ display? Because it was important for young customers if you remember. Okay. So no L_C_D_? And so no speech as well because it w it would delay too much the development process. Yeah. That would be cool. But eight months is really long and Maybe we can just uh Okay. So um I I will uh I will so I we will move to next meeting so in after the lunch break uh here are the individual uh action uh you are required to do but you will be uh recalled to the actions by uh email I think but you can take notes if you if you want but well the instruction will be sent. So thank you for uh your suggestion and I I will make a summary of that meeting that I will put in the shared folder you can't see and uh and then you will um you will be able to to see what has been uh has been said on on this meeting and and what has been decided. Uh maybe for next meeting uh send me your presentation before by email so that we can see them uh altogether. That would be easier. No it did not work. She send it to me by email. So maybe this is better  to send it by email. Okay? So yeah I I'm it's in the first uh email so I'm participant one at AMI uh where is that  it's here. Participant one at AMI. Okay. So see you after lunch break. ,The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting and two team members presented a prototype for the remote the team is designing and discussed its ergonomic appearance and its features. The marketing expert began to lead the team in conducting an evaluation of the prototype but was interrupted when the project manager shifted the discussion to examining the production costs of the team's product. The original specifications of the team's product proved to be too expensive and so the team had to discuss which features to lose and which to maintain in order to meet the target cost. After discussing costs  the team returned to conducting their product evaluation. The prototype was evaluated on the basis of its ability to be located when misplaced  ease of use  appearance  technological innovativeness  and sponginess. Overall  the prototype received average marks. The team then evaluated the project process  finding that they were happy overall but quite displeased with the small budget. 
'Kay. I'll go first. No Nathan's fine. It's either Nathan or participant two. Uh. Okay. Um  basically what I'm gonna have to talk to you about today is um component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers  so Basically what I'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that. Um  components of a remote control  okay. We've already kind of gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon. Energy source  um  our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources  your standard battery  solar cells. Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium so we might have to look if we do go that route  we might have to look elsewhere. Um  and also there's a kinetic energy possibility. Basically  it's like a um the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running. So that's one possibility but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen. So we'll have to look into that. Um  the case  we have a few options  plastic  rubber or wood. Um and then as far as the way it's shaped  we can do standard boring flat  which we probably don't wanna do  curved or very sexy double curved. Um  I imagine that we could specify. Um  I don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres. Yeah. Um  the buttons  there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer  but to use those we'd have to use more chips  um and that would cost us more. And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that. Um and just a little note there  touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro. Um  one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum. So you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote and you know the television can detect that. And if you were to record if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light. Uh one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part use visible light coming out of the remote  just kind of as a fun gimmick. So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it. Course it'd have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that. Yeah. I am sure that we could do that. Um  of course Yeah  just as a fun gimmick. Just to set us apart a little bit. Um  and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use  also known as the chip. Uh  we really don't have any way around the T_A_ one one eight three five. Um findings  okay  we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer  um and my question to all of you is  should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available? 'S a bit of a challenge question. Right  that's my concern too. Um  if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer. My personal preference is I'll just throw my cards on the table  uh I think we should probably go the solar battery route  just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on. Uh  I like the idea of the visible light signalling  that's something to set us apart and uh I was thinking about I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes. So we're not so confined by one style and say some you know  say our the one if we just go with one and it doesn't go over well then we're in a bad situation. Oh yeah  you're welcome. Mm. Mm. Hmm. I should have mentioned this um. As far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case  it has a consistency of those stress balls. Mm. I like the idea of of rubber too because it's tends to be associated with being durable  something that you can drop and it doesn't matter. 'Cause so many you go to so many houses these days and you see broken remote controls. Taped with duck tape and what have you  you wouldn't have that problem if you used rubber. Mm. No. Yeah. My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote  yeah that's just an estimate though. I know. It's fun. I thought there was some flexibility with that. That's just off the top of my head  it is pending further emails. Right. It is the new it would be in a class of its own. It's true. We could initially go with what we have and if we can find them cheaper later on Yeah. I think if we we do both the obviously production costs are going to go way up um but it does put it into it'd become the Rolls Royce of remote controls basically. It would be very nice. Yeah  'cause you you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function. I would have to side with that  I think the voice recognition is simpler  we already have the all the technology in-house  it's ready to go  it's packaged  it's Um  this is just off the top of my head keep in mind  but I think the voice recognition would they're both mm they're both gonna push the costs up  but um  since we already have the technology in-house for the voice recognition we're not gonna have to do as much design work and sometimes the design work is what push the costs up  if you know what I mean. Yeah. Are we going to talk now about um the materials that we're gonna use for the case and all those things? Okay. Um  the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed  'cause sometimes solar power fails and there's no way round that  we should install a small backup battery. Just to cover those moments when for whatever reason  the remote hasn't been exposed to It's true. Yeah  it works about the same as a solar powered calculator  and you know how those those don't really require that much light  um  but obviously a little more light than a calculator  but we're not talking about a lot of light. Doesn't have to be out taking a sunbath for a few hours a day or anything. Hmm. Why  why moving away from hand-held  why? What's the uh idea? Hmm. Do you think people that are people that buy a remote  are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes. Right. I think  I think you're on to something because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote. Maybe something that looks nice on a table is would be good  even though and hand-held the same time. Yeah  those are nice. Mm. Okay. Right. Just kind of the squishy feel. Sorry about the uh lack of information on cost  I just haven't been provided that information by our manufacturers and I'm just having to guess. Right. If  if we're not going the touch-screen route then we can um just incorporate maybe something that folds out like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions up here and something that slides down to reveal the you know more complicated things. Yeah. Right. So are we gonna are we talking we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use  are we going to use scroll buttons? Rubber buttons? Um Right. Right. So have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people? Or are we just going to go with one? ..It's very  it's very hard thing to predict because you have different cases and that might open up your market a little bit obviously  but if you have just one case and it doesn't go very well mm. It's a tough situation  but obviously having more cases also costs more so There's an idea. Right. Oh excellent yeah. That sounds good. Mister participant two that is. Interesting question. Yes. Did you? I like it  I like it. Yes. Fabulous. We can have a duck tape casing. It could go with the granola crowd. Phew. Computer's adjusting. One moment please. So interme interface concept by your faithful user interface designer. So yur user interface  guys  is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear  or otherwise uh perceive. Uh  commands and mechanisms  that basically user uses to control the operator operating system. Here's a d series of different remote controls that are out on the market today. I think we're definitely trying to get away from this kind of a look. Um  so the following are a bunch of different uh interface uh concepts. Uh voice recognition  we we um actually have some new uh information from our research design team but uh I'll get to that in a moment. Um  so current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples  um and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control. Now our design team  research team  has been able to uh set up a system in which uh you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to um with standard responses. Like you could say good morning uh remote control and it'll say in a sexy female voice  Good morning Joe. Um. In fact we already have this for a coffee maker line On the remote control right. Um  another concept is what uh Apple has come up with  the spinning wheel with uh L_C_ display like on the uh iPod which I am sure most of you know about. Um and then we have the scroll button with integrated push-button  kind of like a modern a bit bulky  a bit crazy  I don't think that's we're necessarily going for. And uh some special components  uh ideas like uh blocking  having the ability to block channels from your for your children um and uh dedicated buttons for for commonly used uh channels and even uh ideas like secured or hidden programming but uh I again if we go with touch screen I don't think that's a big issue. Um and uh this is kind of the uh the big daddy of remote controls here. Uh the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose. Um  again probably not what we're going for so I I mean my ideas here and kind of where I think we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod uh with a hard cla c uh plastic casing although I think some of the suggestions we've come up with are definitely uh very good ideas. Uh changeable casings uh our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package to kind of set the idea that you can change it and you can try changing it and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our uh bottom line. Uh touch screen interface  um possibly having go-to buttons being uh stuck into the system so those don't move away from the screen  uh  the important ones like power  volume and jump between channels. Um  and of course our voice command system which I've talked a little bit about already and uh the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features um that are around so red for power  um arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not. And uh perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea like perh mm for instance my toastie maker that I got from my bank has jokes when it's ready. And uh that is about it. Oh you guys are always the dampers on these projects. You industrial designers. Where do you guys come up with these numbers? I'm thinking that's uh definitely a good idea and I also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper uh means to to go about this kind of production  my my team in the uh on the third floor suggested that uh Yeah. I mean I think that we really have two main selling points  I think that our casing and the voice recognition To be honest  we have the capa we have the design in-house  I mean we've we've come up with this  with this new voice we're using it for our coffee machines already. I can pass you on that email from my uh guy in uh guy down the hall. Sounds good. I mean we we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say. Does having both really up our costs? Well my p is Um  I definitely have to agree with that last comment. It's you and me outside a little here. Calculator. I'm willing to agree with everything that's been said. Uh I have to say though that um another idea's come up in my head. If we're really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that  kind of a sleek little uh neat thing that sits on your table or something. Just a thought. Well if you don't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point. I think it's all about following Apple's lead on a lot of these things. Mm-hmm. Exactly. Think then we're hitting our cost issue again. I think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command. Well what are we actually doing? What were Sure. And again copying iMac's kind of for iPod Mac Apple's uh colour scheme. Fabulous. That went well  thank you. Perfect. Go ahead. Nice. Mm. Right. Right. Nice. Interesting. Mm. Good call. Choose it. Well I'd say shop around but with our time constraints  is that really a feasible option? Right. Right. Um It's an option  uh but actually there's I've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing right now which actually might even come into play beforehand  it may help us decide for now. Temporarily anyway. I guess so  'cause I found some interesting things. You waiting for me? I know  what a teaser ain't it. Um. Right. So current market trends. Screen. Um  basically I was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now and what's going on in other design fields  to see sort of what's what's trendy  what's new  what's happening. Um  remote control right now basically everybody says they want newer  fancier  more exciting they're sick of this boring  normal  functional  um that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface. Um the challenge is that current trends right now  across the board in fashion  in furniture  in technology  is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing. Now I'm not saying we should have  you know  tomato shaped remote controls or anything  but I think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours  like if wood is an option  that whole organic  sleek  clean  v line thing may be something we can look into. Different skin options  or if we can't afford this touch plate thing  or touch face screen interface um  maybe having the b images be specific  like you could choose your menu bullets to be a different shape or okay  not the example I would choose  but you know what I mean to t sort of and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy  uh not something I I've come up with a though if we can get around to getting piloting  I thought maybe a casing option like uh not like a skin  but like a holder almost if you could do like um  leather options or wood options or something Mm-hmm. Mm. Might be an interesting way to go. Um  yeah so something to sit on for now. So overall I think we should stick with what we're finding  everyone's looking for easy to use  technologically innovative and this fancy new I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now. Um. Yeah. Um. Well I d but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really a non-issue. True. Very true. Very true. Very much so. Um We could. I think that goes against the whole fancy something  a new line  but worth a shot. Ah  it could be  it could be  um. Yeah that's what I know. No problem. Mm. Yeah. Very true  very true. Mm. Hmm. Okay. Mm  right. Mm. Nice. Mm. Mm. I think it's our most marketable feature just because it's so new and it's something that is showing up in other places. But can we really afford it 'cause it looks like they would be  that would be a really main cost source then right? Per? Piece. I know And our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty? Do we remember? Okay. Can we justify it? Right. Though I think that's what people would pay for  I mean if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote  you're gonna expect it to do something Yeah. Right. Yeah. See if we can cut some corners. Right. Well and we can look into this other manufacturing option  and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper. Right. It's a starting point anyway  so. Mm. Yeah 'cause with voice recognition I mean really this is pretty bells and whistles kinda remote. I think we'd have to decide between 'em definitely. Price-wise. True. We've already got it. Pretty much. Right and they said they wanted voice recognition. Course  maybe they hadn't thought of this whole touch screen option  but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have the technology and we're not gonna use it even though we know it'll sell is a call I don't think I can give the highs ups. Like really I can't go in and say no we're gonna just ignore everything we know. Yeah. Yeah. Well  we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent. But uh I I I personally would tend to another direction but if that's what's gonna sell I think that's what we need to go with and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model. Mm. Right. Right. And we're still not then we don't have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either  we can stick with what we've already got. In a lot other ways too. I think it's our lower risk option which for right now we can have it on the market sooner which is all in all our best option. So and when are we gonna have basic prototypes coming up next that's you guys's next step right? Right. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well what of people with like the T_V_ in their basement  like what if wha we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere so having a secondary source is probably Yeah. True. True. Right. Okay. Uh Interesting. I if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job. True  and i probabl I think we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people  like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too  right. Mm-hmm. Yep. Yeah. With the bu yeah. Mm-hmm. True. Way to go. Yeah I'm thinking of the airport portal  you know like that little pod looking thing? Right. That would be kinda neat. Terracotta bowl or something. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Yeah  which is the next big thing  so that's not gonna hurt us either. Right. Handy. Okay. Mm. Right. Well when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis  although I'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions  they should be secondary  at least if not functionally then visually  like those shouldn't be Take precedence  yeah. Right. And they slide. Well and do we wanna consider like an iPod screen which isn't a touch screen but you're still scrolling through menu options  in p True  we're still not making it easier then. True. Fair enough. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah it's just a scroll. Yeah. Yeah. Probably. Right. Mm. Well no it's basic just like four directions that are that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you wanna do it  are really versatile and everybody's already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own so it's not like we're dealing with everybody relearning things 'cause that's not something anybody's gonna wanna buy a new for. Mm. Right  particularly in technological fields  so that's exactly where we're headed. Uh. Oh it wasn't in the way but yeah  whatever. No  don't worry about it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Mm. Yeah. Yeah  get in there. Yeah  totally. Cool. Cool. That's great. Alright  let me just PowerPoint this up. Right so um this meeting will be about the conceptual design  don't ask me s precisely what conceptual design is  it's just something important that we need to do. Um  think of it 's kind of uh turning the abstract into slightly more concrete. In this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype. Um. Right so um  apologies for the last meeting  it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough  um  so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting. Um  fair enough  thanks for the input  's always good. Um. So  basically all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time  um  and gonna go through you  uh whoever wants to go first is f fine by me um and we'll collate what we know about um what we discussed in the last meeting  possible directions. And then we'll make some more decisions on um basic uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work. So  perfect. So  without th further ado  whoever wants to go first is free to. Alright Nathan  take it away. It is Nathan right? I'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again? Good. Nice. Mm. Hmm. What kind of th thickness are we looking at? Okay  brilliant. Hmm. Hmm. M Maybe is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like Yeah I like the idea  it's a good idea. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. Can we do marketing piloting too? Try to see what kind before we launch can we see how they're received? Okay. Okay. Okay  perfect. Great  thank you very much Nathan. That's perfect  so I guess that makes sense for you to take it from here. Fascinating  compelling even. Tomatoes. Slick  slick. Interface  oh the interface graphics for the um Yeah. Mm. Yeah  it's like  yep it's ubiquitous isn't it? Great  thanks for that Sarah. Ron? Yeah. Lot of single people on the um on the re on the remote control research team at the Mm. Mm. Yeah  I can see. Mm. Great. Great  wonderful Ron  cool. Lot of good ideas  good facts to have. That's what they need  it's like a little dongle it just sticks up this further so you don't have to stand up every time  just connect it  my kingdom. Right so  good to know all that stuff  thanks guys  um. Now we kind of have to come to some decisions  um  I figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have a chat about it. Um. Based on what Nathan presented as far as the um various costs and benefits um I think  I dunno  what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point? 'Kay. 'Kay. Mm-hmm. To produce each one. Mm. Hmm. Well. There is  it's just  it is a question of and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money. Um  from twelve fifty if we d wanna get our fift uh hundred per cent profit margin um that would mean selling it from twenty five. If you multiply seventeen fifty by two that's thirty five. So From the board  um  well That's true  I mean And that's to be fair the um the per cent of the market we're not going for mass any you know  mass sales anyway  we're gonna make I mean we we're not talking about selling eight zillion of these things  we just couldn't  not for twenty-five Euros  so we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five  sell 'em for thirty  but that's something that we can have finance deal with. Um  I say that we provisionally go with the touch screen or wh y wh what was your thought on the matter Ron? Mm. No we could have a s very simple touch screen  you know  there's always the opportunity  if it's gonna be about the size of the iPod or whatever  you know  w we yeah  I guess we can play around with it a bit. Alright  let's let's say that okay so the touch screen will be our um our main selling point here. So The voice rec thing  I mean  if if we're looking at bottom line  now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on  I think we might have to drop the voice rec. Yeah. Hmm. What do you think on it Nathan? About the voice rec? Mm. Yeah. I can't see how it wouldn't  I mean  there's you know the old aphorism  you can have it fast  you can have it cheap or you can have it quality  pick two of three. You know  you can't you can't have all three. It's just impossible. Well if we're gonna pick betwe e alright so we have to pick between one of the two. Um. Otherwise  yeah  we just it just becomes cost prohibitive. What which  which do we suspect we should hold o we should hold on to? 'Kay. What does the cost look like Ron? Is it cheaper to do the V_R_ or to do the uh touch screen? Nathan? Mm. Right. Mm. Okay. So I'm getting alright so more or less you guys think that o o of the two of 'em  the voice recognition will be better. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Sorted. We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition. Yeah  well we'll we'll sic we'll sort out what it what f what else we're gonna talk about for the prototype but yeah that's our next step  it'll be a developing of prototype. Yes. We'll just run through it yeah  yeah  um. You discussed either a lithium or a solar power. Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition? Or this kinesthetic one  would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control? Mm. Mm. Yep. Right. Okay. What do you think Ron? Okay. Hmm. Yeah. Well we have to have buttons on it too as well. But that's done  that's no bother I mean if you look at the catalogue from places like with sharper image or whatever you know they might have or like um who is it  Apple makes these really pretentious speakers with the th sub-woofers you know like clear and glass and you know and then they got these little pyramidal type of um speakers. I mean  why not have a little rounded kind of thing  it could still have the basic buttons on it. Um  'cause we're going for basic functionality primarily as well. And maybe a menu button and so forth  you know um use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever you know I mean we can sort that out. Yeah. Mm. Yeah  I mean a nice although we do um wh uh is I'm recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing and get back to it but you could have a very tasteful um wood coloured or earth tone kind of um Still  I mean  yeah  along those lines. Yeah I like that  I like that idea a lot. Um  let's see what we can do as far as that goes. And the uh the material like the plastics and so forth  we were discussing that being uh using like a rubber kind of softer feel  um you know li lik if you feel the the tip on this pen it's a bit gives just a bit. You know something where it's uh a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it. Mm 'kay. Yeah let's see if we can do a squishy non-remote control-looking remote control. But to be fair  yeah  I mean  you just c you could just put it literally put it on the the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up. Yeah I like it  I like the idea  that's good. Um and we've sorted of discussed costs  um. I guess we'll a that's gonna be uh a thing  if we run a bit over-budget  that might be okay  um. We'll have more of an idea when the prototype have more of a we'll have more of an idea later on. Um. And we just yeah go from there. Um  so we've revisited the touch screen and more or less ruled that out  um  I think so we're more or less con we wh wh we're more or less in agreement that we want to have a um a simple kind of function  you know  not too complex. Like maybe have menu things. Mm. Yes. Yeah we've also got the the me the thing of  if we're gonna have a non-remote-looking remote  how do we yeah. B But no I mean we could do a slide or a compartment  you know  like if it say it's a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing  it'd be easy to have a compartment in there. Or you know  a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing  like on um like on a D_V_D_ player. You know you see the modern D_V_D_ players'll just have um a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them and you can just kind of manoeuvre through the menu like that. Well it seems like I dunno it seems to me that we could just do the um stick with the rubber 'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of um rubber for the outside case we might as well stick with that um. Mm 'kay  um. We've already kind of covered this as well. That seems to be selling um and we we've more or less agreed that we want to kar target this youth market  um. Especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population. Mm-hmm  mm-hmm. Okay. Um. Yeah alright  well  more or less covered what we need to cover I think fi an an any final thoughts before we think about doing the protot moving on to the prototype. Right. I was just gonna step on to um I wasn't? Oh  my bad um sorry. The um  yeah okay I was just gonna assign tasks in the next b anyth any oth any other final thoughts before we go ahead and cool? Um. Yeah. Well then again colours wouldn't be so hard to do  you could have uh a  you know  a um uh kind of a natural wood colour  like a stained wood and um  I don't know  olive green or something. That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the thing. Yeah  I think that's probably a good id okay so let's work on uh multiple case colours. But yeah  stick with the same kind of kinda yeah  the same basic non-remote kind of remote design. Cool. Alright  so we'll have the next meeting about half an hour  um. I want the uh I'd like Nathan  I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel  what can we accomplish  um  given these parameters that we're just gonna sort of have this kind of uh non-remote remote. Um  what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype. And um Ron if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple. Somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place. Um  and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff. Um I need you guys to work together on making a prototype  um using um prototype building materials um. And also um specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well. So that's what to start with for now  is that alright  you guys feel clear about this? Alright. I guess we'll just hit the bricks. Thanks guys. ,The Marketing Expert presented the results of a market survey that indicated users' most important preferences in remote control features. He discussed trends in fashion that should be incorporated into the prototype design. The User Interface Designer compared the designs of several competitors' remotes to decide which features should be used in their own design. She discussed using voice recognition  an LCD screen  and color to make the device easier to use and to improve its look. The Industrial Designer went over all of the internal components and materials that will be incorporated in the design. He gave a layout of the placement of the components in the device. The group decided to use a rubber or latex material to give the device a spongy feel. He discussed the color and shape of the remote with the group and the placement of the components on the device. The group discussed colors and shapes further  and decided that the remote will be yellow  and perhaps having a fruit-inspired shape. The group decided to use a rechargeable battery and recharging stand. The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to construct the prototype. 
So yeah I think you can do it. Twenty five Euros? Yep. Yeah. That's me. Okay. Yeah. No I'm user interf I'm user interface design. Okay. So what's the difference between user interface design d industrial design? Yeah  I think so. Okay  so I make uh u user interface. You you de you implement the core functions in the Use it. Make make yeah. Maybe I think uh uh i industrial design's uh  it's the function design. I design the user f user interface  you design the function. Yeah. Okay. Yeah yeah. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. And uh simple. And easy to use. Ah  yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah yeah  you try. Try first. You can draw something which is very simple. Oh  maybe we should bring Kemy here. Kemy is really good at drawing. You're going to draw? Okay. What's this? It's a fat cat. Can you draw uh um rabbit? Oh  hat ha rat. Yeah. Yeah  it's okay. Mm. Okay. Oh. Okay  I draw. The only thing I can draw is like this. Oh. Oh. Oh. No. What's this? Okay. Okay. The only thing I can draw  because it's very simple. Oh. Okay  be careful. No problem  no problem.. A person? Dog. Okay. Okay. So we have break. Oh. Hmm. No. Okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. So right now? Mm. It's reasonable  I think  yeah. Those things just refer to each of each of us  I think. AMI and okay. Okay. Okay  and Marketing Expert  it's me. You can manage all this  yeah. Good. Um. Not really. So which you  the Industrial Designer. Okay. Yeah. I mean  you have to know. Ah  you have to know it. It's your job  so I hope you you know what it is. Mm. Yeah. Okay. Well. You know. Oh  okay  okay. Not the other one. Yeah  I'm just go I'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have and then thi this would I guess converged to the User Interface Designer wi and then Industrial Designer. Mm. Mm-hmm. And you have to keep it under twelve Euros and f fifty  so. That's the problem. Mm. It's clear. Yeah  maybe should go and draw an animal. Many Yeah. Uh it's the same as mine. It's the fat cat  okay. A rat? That's difficult. Yeah. Just go  you you the closest to the whiteboard. Jus Yeah. A duck. Pikachu. Oh yeah. Bugs Bunny one. Okay. I go. What? Oh. So what else? This was my favourite one  but Right. A fish. Oh yeah  doesn't look so fine. Okay  it's your turn. Mm. Good. I think it's done. Yeah. Oh  we have twenty five minutes for the meeting. Okay. Know what time is it? No. Good. Ah okay. It's Ada Longmund? Maybe someone ha we have to this whiteboard  yeah? Yeah  I don't know. I it's it's reasonable  s quite yeah. Twenty five. Is Yeah. I I hope so I_D_ is for the Industrial Design  yeah? And U_I_D_  it's for the User Interface Designer  yeah? AMI yeah project. you will be the manager yeah. I am the Industrial Design  yeah I am the Industrial Designer so. It's difficult. You know very soon. So I I think the user the user interface design is he will design how the user will you know the relation between the user and you know the remote control so And the uh industrial design  it is how the object will look like. Yeah. So the materi Okay right. But I was thinking that he's a user 'cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be  you know. But I don't know. Okay. I'm the industrial designer. So. Okay. So and the marketing expert will Ok Okay. It should be There was a step about drawing something in the in the board  I don't know. Is it? Are we supposed to do right now? Oh right it's it's from the left to the ri It's I d I was thinking but I n I'm not sure now. Oh Everybody I think everybody should do it  so. It's not matter So. yeah. It's a It's a cat. It is not a fat cat. Yeah  it is a Yes you have to draw a rat if you want a rat. It's your rat. Okay  go right  but in grow  it's everybody has to grow What are you I don no idea  so It's a rabbit. It's not so bad so. So you don't have a A fish. That's a that's a fish? Okay  let's try to draw something. Have to be really careful. Ah it's my turn. Okay. So. It's ok So  what can I draw some more?? No. Mm Yeah  it's it's a se it's my priority this one. Yeah. No. It's a really crazy dog Okay. Transfer. It's a dog in a village. So what are you sug going to do now? It's done? Oh my God. Yeah  it's okay. We have an idea yeah. I have an idea of my job so yeah so. Yeah. So we can start? Suppose I have to do my presentation. Eh um So  I'll present myself  I'm Ada Longmund  and as you may know it  I'm the pr project manager. So um we will have to um speak about m the project. Our project project is to create um a new remote control and as you may know there's lot of industrials interesting in creating a remote control  so the remote control has to be original  trendy and um user-friendly. Record. So the project method is the following. So if we're um the functional design  you have to do uh any individual work and uh also work with uh meetings talking with each other. Uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design. Uh. The tool training is to try out the white board  so Maybe you can draw your favourite animal and make a list of its favourite characteristics. I don't know if we have to do it now  maybe later later. So the selling price of the product will be twenty five Euros. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's quite good price  yeah. And uh it will uh be a an international remote control  as we want to sell it in the entire world  and the product costs will be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes. So  as you will discuss about the remote control you will have to experience your um with the remote control. Um just uh maybe be imaginative with remote const con controls  try to create something new and people would like to to buy. And and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes  so you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role and you know I suppose you know what you have to do. And uh you will have to work on the design and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications. Yeah. I_D_  yeah. So So I will manage all all the group. So you have questions? So you all know what the parts of the work you have to do. Mm-hmm. And you? Mm okay. Hmm. I suppose you have to design it and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it. And i maybe you will transform it. Maybe  it is the outside and the inside. And yeah. And when designing y the remote control just remember that uh it has to be a kind of international product. So you don't have to do something really specific  as everybody everybody will have to use it  it's sor the same as keyboards. You know  you have Qwerty  Azerty  French and U_K_ keyboard  so really the remote control to be international. And not too expensive. As we want to maximise the benefit. Yeah  you have to keep in mind that the product cost won't be maxim more than twelve dot fifty Euros. And to be sure that really people will be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new functionalities that don't exist in the mm existing remote controls now. So  is it okay? So you think we have to do it now? You want me to draw something? Product manager okay  let's go  I will try. No. A mouse is not too difficult. Mouse is okay. You love the eyes. Yeah  that was the eyes. A clown. Rabbit. It's a rabbit. Yeah. Thank you. You forgot the chips. Fish and chips. Of Oh.? Oh yeah. Yeah  I think yeah. Just have to present project  discuss a little bit about it. Yeah. So  if you have questions. It's okay? You know your job? you know your job? You know your job? Okay. ,"The project manager opens the meeting stating that they will address the functional design of the remote and saying they are still undecided about whether it should be universal or specific. He suggests they name the project and they come up with ""mando""  meaning ""control"" in Spanish. The marketing expert presents some research done on user opinions of remotes. He suggests the use of using voice recognition or an LCD  which they discuss despite concerns about budget limitation. The industrial designer presents  showing examples of existing products and suggesting they add a scroll wheel for channel-changing. He says Internet capability might be necessary for an LCD and then brings up button size  suggesting having a flip-open door with extra buttons under it. They discuss voice recognition again  and then the interface specialist presents. He suggests they have two types of user interfaces and brings up that voice recognition would increase production price. They talk about the budget limitations on features and then the project manager summarizes decisios made and closes the meeting by teeling each group member what he should work on. "
Hmm. Yes. Well. Oh my god  it's better than what I'm gonna be able to do. Take my contraptions with me. Alright  I'm Jessy. I'm from around D_C_ ish sort of in the U_S_. And we're gonna keep the deep sea sort of theme going on  animal. Don't really know how to draw this. Just where can I Mm. Mm. Maybe if I do the water  but how? Sort of give an idea. I have no idea how one would explain this. Mm maybe with some whiskers. Briefly  it's supposed to be a seal. You can imagine it in the water. I like them  because they are like playful and silly sort of have a good time. Not gonna try and pretend like I can get any better than that. It's definitely significantly harder once you are doing it. That's impressive. Um I hate when there's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the T_V_ like you have to do one for the power of the T_V_ and then like another one to get the actual screen on and something else to get it all going  I don't know. Now they keep combining all different remotes together  and I don't know if I necessarily like that 'cause I feel like you end up with multimedia overload. I just wanna watch the T_V_ um. Always gets lost. Some sort of like device to help you find it. Yeah. What about like batteries and things like that  like are there some remotes that don don't require like batteries or do all remotes require batteries? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And maybe that spatially divides it  so it's like if you're looki if you're trying to get the T_V_ on that's  you know  like the top thing on the remote  I dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're gonna make it  but if it's like all the T_V_ stuff was here  then all the V_C_R_ stuff was here  all the whatever else we have programmed into it it's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together  'cause then you like  I don't even know what I'm turning on. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm hmm. I think it's just T_V_  I mean  if it if we're taking it just new product a new television remote control that's not like doesn't say. You know  things might be more advanced than that. It's an idea with the buttons being really. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I'm four. Uh Okay. Well  my name is Iain uh and I'm the User Interface Designer for the project. Um. And I'll try and draw my favourite animal. I'll I should leave that one on there shouldn't I before I callously rub it off. Um I'm not gonna draw it quite to scale um. Is that at least identifiable? It's a whale  yes. Thanks. Um and  yeah  the reason I like whales is 'cause uh they're well  first of all they're quite intelligent um and also they're they're kind of mysterious  like we don't really know much about them or or understand how they work  how they form groups. And I just find them interesting animals. Cool. I've used  I've used remote controls  for things like T_V_ and the C_D_ player and video recorder and I I guess they're they're pretty neat neat little tools uh. You don't have to get up and walk across the room to change a channel. So especially if you're someone really lazy like me they they're pretty nice. Um. I find them they can be a bit annoying  especially  like you know if I'm watching T_V_ I have have to have three separate remote controls of in front of me  you know  one for the T_V_  one for the digital box  one for m the video recorder as well. Um. And also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing  they've got too many buttons on them uh too too sort of too sort of complicated when all I really wanna do is switch on and off  change the channel  change the volume. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Can I ask  are we designing a remote control for a television only um  and if if this device is just to be used for the television would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it? Um or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it? So we should maybe we should assume that i t it's just a television that we're wanting to control. Well  I mean I suppose it would be nice to have playing and record and stop buttons on it for the video recorder as well I I don't know if that works technologically or not. Yeah. Yeah. 'Kay. What we're gonna be discussing at the next meeting? Do we know that? Right. Yep. Yep. Okay. Can you e-mail your slides as well? Is that possible? Cool. 'Kay Alima. Okay. Um I don't know which one of these I have to bring with me. Right  so  I'm supposed to draw my favourite animal. I have no drawing skills whatsoever. But uh let's see  introduce myself. My name is Alima Bucciantini. Um I'm from the state of Maine in the US. I'm doing nationalism studies  blah  blah  blah  and I have no artistic talents. A_ L_ I_ M_ A_. Oh  and I guess I'm the Industrial Designer on this project. So let's see if I can get um here. I will draw a little turtle for you all. Not necessarily 'cause it's my absolute favourite animal  but just that I think they're drawable. And you have the pretty little shell going on. Some little eyes. Happy. There you go. That's a turtle. Um. I I like the whole having a shell thing. It's quite cool carry your home around where you go  um quite decorative little animals  they can swim  they can  they're very adaptable  they carry everything they need with them  um and they're easy to draw. No  you can erase the turtle  it's alright. Snake. Well  snake? It's w Oh  a cat. Yeah. Right. That's That's pretty impressive. Yeah um. I agree with having too many remotes around. My dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes for various things  and I don't know how to work half of them um. What's important for me  I guess  is that it's easy to use and that there's not too many buttons  they are not too small  you know you know you need to n to know what you're doing. And one thing I particularly like is if you are not um sort of moving it around to get it to work with the infra-red. Um  I think there is a way around that  but I know in my residence right now the the television you sort of have to walk all around the room to get it to turn on  so i it's just simpler just to just turn around the T_V_ itself  and I think that's if we're gonna make a remote control  it should actually work for what it's doing. So I know. Yeah  something that doesn't Mm. Yeah. Could we get something that just has No doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or program s other things that I'm not very coherent about  but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything  you know volume control  on  off  channel changing. Yeah. N that way Yeah. Yeah  and if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day. Um. Yeah. Mm. Right. Mm. Mm yeah. Yes. I guess we have to define what what we're aiming for. If it's just a television then that it's a bit simpler  'cause there's less buttons that would even need to be on it. Large. If you have older people or people like me that aren't very co-ordinated hand-eye  it's really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons  if we can help it. Hmm. Yeah. 'Kay. I'm sure we'll be busy. I'm two. Alright. 'Kay. Okay. Good morning everybody. Um I'm glad you could all come. I'm really excited to start this team. Um I'm just gonna have a little PowerPoint presentation for us  for our kick-off meeting. My name is Rose Lindgren. I I'll be the Project Manager. Um our agenda today is we are gonna do a little opening and then I'm gonna talk a little bit about the project  then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other a little bit  including a tool training exercise. And then we'll move into the project plan  do a little discussion and close  since we only have twenty five minutes. First of all our project aim. Um we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about  it needs to be original  trendy and user-friendly. I'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those. Um so we're gonna divide us up into three compa three parts. First the functional design which will be uh first we'll do individual work  come into a meeting  the conceptional design  individual work and a meeting  and then the detailed design  individual work and a meeting. So that we'll each be doing our own ideas and then coming together and um collaborating. Okay  we're gonna get to know each other a little bit. So um  what we're gonna do is start off with um let's start off with Amina. Um Alima  sorry  Alima. Um we're gonna do a little tool training  so we are gonna work with that whiteboard behind you. Um introduce yourself  um say one thing about yourself and then draw your favourite animal and tell us about it. Probably both. How do you spell your name? Thanks. So what are your favourite characteristics? Mm. Excellent. Shall we just go around the table? Mm. Might be nice to have them all up there at same time. Em Mm 'kay. Mm 'kay? I'm Rose and I'm Project Manager  from California. Um. Hmm. S Um it's actually a coyote. Let's see. Let's see  let's give it a little bit of a snout  I don't know  some teeth. Yeah. Oh dear. Yes. I live um I live right across the street from an open space in California. We have coyotes howl all the time. So I really enjoy their their singing  you they're really beautiful animals. Mm. Okay um  moving on to slightly more serious stuff. We're gonna talk about project finances. Um we have a couple we'd like to sell it for about twenty five Euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million Euro um from our sales and because this is such this is for television it's a we have a market range of Internet  like it's an international market range  we don't have to worry about specifics. Um in order to make a profit of this magnitude  we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty Euro. So we're selling it for twice what we'd like to produce it for. Okay um  just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um  I could I'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls  um your first ideas about um creating a new r remote control  what would be the best um like you what are the features that you really like what are the features that you don't like  etcetera  so Hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Um I would imagine all of them  but we could but it's possible we could use like a lithium battery um that would last a lot longer than like double A_s. Um like tho those are the batteries that are used in a lot of um M_P_ three players now and that kind of thing. Um. Um. Okay  it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes. So um like you said you don't like having all the buttons on one on one remote  and yet you don't wanna have five remotes. So how do we work with that? Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Okay  so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on  off  channel changing  volume  and another rote remote with all the special things. Because that is one thing that um remotes tend to have buttons that the T_V_s no longer have as well. So like you have to have them somewhere  'cause you're gonna m need those special functions occasionally. Um but not necessarily on the m the normal remote. Good question. I don't know that yet. It's a good question. Um. I'll look into that. If I can. Mm. Mm. Okay. 'Kay sounds like we've had a good little discussion for our first ideas. Mind if we move on? Ps mm okay. Um now our next meeting starts in thirty minutes. I believe we've actually been only working on this this one for about twenty  so we can continue discussing more new ideas if you'd like um  but this is just a breakdown of what we'll be doing individually. Um the industrial design  Alima will be doing um the working design. Um the User Interface Designer  that's for. Technical functions  I guess like keeping in mind the buttons thing  the size of the buttons. Um user requirements um  so you'll be hearing about different trends  uh about different things that people need  um I guess kind of the same uh discussion that we've been having  we'll get from the actual consum s consumers. Mm 'kay um. And you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach. I realised in this past one we we didn't have much  we just wanted to get a little brain-storming done. Um so very exited to see all your animals and how what wonderful um artists we all are um. Any questions? I haven't gotten an agenda yet  um I'll put that together. I'm sure as we'll each get our own instruction and then um because what we gonna do is first our individual actions and then we'll come back together. So I'm sure we'll all have more concrete things to contribute next time Mm 'kay um I'll type up mi minutes and probably email those out to all of you. Um just including all the things that we talked about. Um. Yes  I yes  I think I can. Mm-hmm. I'll just attach it to an email. And you're you're number two  three  four? Is that correct? Okay. Excellent. It was lovely meeting you all. Just make sure you keep checking the company web site and the emails. Let me see if I can do that right now. Mm 'kay. ,The project manager opens the meeting by welcoming everybody and saying they will be developing a new television remote control. Then each group member states his/her name and role in the group. The project manager states that the remote needs to be original  trendy  and user-friendly. The further work will be on the functional  conceptual  and detailed design. Since they all know what a whiteboard is  they do a virtual drawing by each stating their favorite animal. The project manager tells them the project budget. They proceed to discuss problems with current remotes as well as preferable styles and looks  such as using face-plates so the look is changable. The project manager closes the meeting. 
Right first time this time. Nu There we go. It's not that complicated  but I get it wrong every time. For Matthew  yep. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yep. Mm-hmm. I have a presentation  I'm just making this Okay I'll just email you this file  my presentation. Mm-hmm I'm just emailing it to you. Okay it should've gone through to you. Mm-hmm. Okay so this is just a presentation on uh the trends that we're gonna use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment. Um can I just put this on? So we have to work out a way what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it so people wanna buy it. Um. This is to do this I will not remove my microphone. We basically used um some focus group surveys which I went through with you last time  the main results of that  and um some research on the current design um and fashion trends that are out there at the moment um  and as part of this The important aspects that came out were things that we've already discussed really. The most important by far was the look and feel of it. It needs to be something that's very different from everything else out there. It needs to stand out. It needs to be not functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment. Most people find remote controls boring at the moment  we need to have something that looks interesting  that looks exciting  that will stand out. People will wanna buy it. Um That was twice as i important as the next item on here which is that it has to be technologically innovative has to have something else  apart from just the look of it. People have to then think about it and say got something there that I want. That's a really cool feature  and it has to make them wanna buy it again. Third on the list  and again innovative was twice as important as this last um aspect  it has to be easy to use. So they have to be able to be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it um. Drawing on the fashion trends at the moment  uh fruit and vegetables um. This is basically talking about just the the feel of it  so probably not the smell of it  but the bright colours  um eye-catching  really bold designs  and a spongy feel. Um I had a talk to the design people about this  but having a remote that's tactile  that feels different  that would be really cool. That would make it stand out. Um. Well ma make it not necessar sp spongy is the current thing. Spongy is the current texture  but basically there are no reports no remotes at the moment which are spongy or tactile at all  so if we make it like maybe furry or soft or something  that'll be something that sets it apart  rather than just bare plastic which they all are at the moment. So as far as the design goes  the very most important aspect was the design  to the customers. So going with the fruit and vegetable idea  we've got the bright colours  so makes it stand out  the oranges and the the bright yellows and the florescent colours  part of the fruit and vegetables um. Going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones  they've all got those a lot of them have the changeable covers  so they can choose what colour the outside is. That's one way of looking at it um. Textured feel we just talked about. Maybe it's another way of doing that. So if it's part of the the changeable covers then may maybe they can choose a different texture  a spongy one or a soft one or something like that. So they can choose it li as they want to to maybe to fit in with their decor in their living room  or just what they like  their sports team or whatever. Um and yeah  still taking the inspiration from the mobile phone design so functionality  the way the mobile phones work  the way the keypad looks. Also just the way that a lot of industrial design is going into mobile phones at the moment. They're big selling items. People put a lot of thought into that so we can leverage off that  and we can start using some of their ideas. Um back to technological in in innovation  not quite as important  but still a big issue. Um we talked about having a way of finding a remote control if it's been lost  uh that's one thing we could look at. There are other aspects like L_C_D_ screens and speech recognition which weren't I don't think  in my personal opinion  gonna be worth the extra expense and the extra effort that will go into them. I think we're better doing something basic like this which is very important and very will be a really cool feature to put in. And use. I had no real specific ideas for this  maybe we just  the basic idea of having your core functions big and at the top maybe  by themselves  and then yeah and then th th the finer details of buttons you don't use as much either hidden away or completely separate. Yep and that's the presentation. So does anyone have any comments or ideas on that? I think you Hmm. Well we're selling so many units of this. This is gonna be a mass marketed product  we can afford to have two or three different designs at least. Mm mm. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm  yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Mm. I like the idea though of having speech recognition for like the n the name of a channel like B_B_C_  rather than having to remember the the number of it on the keypad. That's a good idea. Mm. Hmm. Mm. Yeah I really like that idea. Mm-hmm. Mm. Maybe ten channels  yeah at the most. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm b But a coffee machine  there's not too many words they'd be using with that it's a it's a small vocabulary. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Two thirty five supposed to finish. Hmm. Hmm. Mm. Yeah. Mm. I think you can do it both ways. You can have it so it's easy they can pick it up and use it straight away without doing anythi without customizing it  or if they want to they have the option of using these extra features. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Mm. Hmm. Mm. Hmm. Mm. Hmm. I like the idea too of being able to use the remote in the dark  so either having the buttons so you can feel the difference between them or if they if they light up or something. Mm. Mm. Hmm. Mm. Hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm just have a yeah Just the veneer on it  yeah. Hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Well maybe we need specific costings then. Actually do maybe two designs and then cost them out and see which one is gonna fit in our budget better. Mm. Mm. Hmm. Mm yeah sure. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Mm. So is there any of these that you're looking at particularly or is this just ideas? Mm-hmm. Hmm. Mm. Mm. Mm yeah. You see? Yeah. Mm well one I've had before  a r r remote control we have at home is one that's actually got a cover on the bottom so the bottom bit is just  covers half the keys most of the time  and then you can slide the cover back to get to the the more advanced keys. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Um yeah I've seen that before too. Anoth another like b it flips up and then you've got another layer of buttons underneath. Mm. But I've seen also with keys and buttons on the top of here as well. I like this one. I like the shape of this one. Can we have can we think about maybe having a a non-recta non non-rectangular one  so with not just the straight little box that's a maybe curved or something. Mm mm 'kay. Is this for the next meeting though? I think we might be out of time out of time for this meeting. Yep. No. So is this is there anything else I need to do from a marketing point of view for the next meeting? Mm. Okay well is this me designing a way to evaluate it so Thinking about how to set up test groups and things? Mm. Okay. Yep. Mm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm 'kay. Thanks guys. Sorry. So Yeah I sent you the slides  you didn't see them? Okay.. So 'Kay. You can Yeah. Voila. Yeah. Yeah s then we could discuss later like we can put all ideas together. It should be easier with that. Yeah. So Yeah. Yeah so I'll I'll go with that actually so um Okay so m so then the the idea of uh having a remote is generally you have uh different keys and uh different structures  different forms  and uh they could be like buttons or like and um they could be of uh a varying sizes if you want to to uh basically emphasize a particular key more than the other  and uh maybe like you can have different colours for example having the r red for the on off switching on and off the button. So this this is the general trend to ha the method they do. So what I have found was that uh currently uh the they are mostly that the T_V_  V_C_R_  music system operated ones actually  and they are very specific to each other  but there are some common keys for example if you want to follow the V_C_R_ and if you want to follow the uh g uh s some uh soundtrack on the w w see they have the common thing actually you can have and uh There is also um a speech recognition to store channel information  names  like You can basically if you have a multiple functionality  say T_V_  V_C_R_ or something I say it to the T_V_ and the T_V_  and you can programme the keys if you want to  certain keys are even the channel information. Yeah yeah so you you you can just uh because uh as more and more channels come then you have more and more problems to remember the v v exact channel numbers ex exactly  even if you arrange it by however you arrange it  you still have the problem to remember exactly which channel you want to So it it it's like it limited one. In the present market I saw it that says something like they are looking for eighty word thing  eighty word  which shouldn't be th that difficult to implement  like eighty to hundred word. Basically you want you don't want to store all the channels in the remote control  you want to st store your favourite channel. Yeah some ten twelve channel information. You know you don't want to st store all the hundred channel information into that. And uh basically uh it depends like the remote with L_C_D_ display for browsing because you have multiple functionalities for example you are watching a movie  and uh uh you are having a universal remote control and you want to uh you don't know really which functionality is now  so I am using the T_V_ so every time I use it  it could be like  for example I can use a simple toggle switch  and a display  so I press it so the display says  okay  I'm in T_V_ or D_V_D_ or whatever it is  instead of having three keys separately for four keys  to model the functionalities will increase actually  and for you and you might want you don't want separate keys for all of them. You can't. And uh well there can be children friendly where you can programme your remote so that they they are not allowed uh to browse certain channels which you can block them  and you can operate them. So these are the things presently which are seen in the market scenarios at present. I personally would look at things like having a u universal remote  is uh um is a good idea  like instead of having unusual ones for all of them you can think of having  um with multiple functionality possibly with speech recognition. I got a mail from the the coffee machine interface unit that uh they have uh integrated the s speech recognition into a into the coffee machine  and so if you say hello coffee machine  it say hi Joe  or something like that  you know  and uh Yeah you you won't be using it  so it's a limited vocabulary mm thing  and very isolated word and it's uh it is interesting  and basically storing the channel through voice or other ways of programming your keys  on the display for the browsing which is again and maybe having something like a blinking thing  like uh it could indicate you're uh it it could indicate what is cal like the uh whether uh you you have enough battery in your in your uh remote  the blinking. At the same time  if it's a dark room  it can be used to locate the remote also or Yeah you can let them to do that. N no but the if you give it d depends on the easiness like the user how much effort he can put. Like for example uh I would like to store in certain way  so if you want to give the full freedom to the user or you want to keep some constraints and let the user use it with that constraint. So it de So So Yeah. Yeah. We well we can still look at we can talk with the coffee unit and you can uh check how much how much they yeah yeah yeah. Maybe we can come we we can talk to them  and we can come with that  you know. And also well you can think of having uh since you have a you know something maybe if you added little bit of display  you might need the to che keep checking the battery  so you really need a some kind of indicator  so it could be a blinking option of L_E_D_ it could actually be used to detect also. If it's in a dark room you can basically detect it also. So No actually i if i it is like you know it tells you um  it can be for two purposes  like if you have an L_C_D_ display and all those things it's not going to be the standard remote  which is having uh which need just uh six six volt uh th sorry three volts um of D_C_. It may need more actually  so y you you may need to check your battery usage it and then you need that  some functionality to indicate the battery limit. And then if the battery limit is indicated  if it could be ind indicated through a blinking something and it can change the colour depending on your uh how much is the battery  well that is good enough to even locate even if you want to. You know. Yeah so You you have time some more? Yep. Sure you can you know. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah mm mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. Yeah so of course for example uh I wanted to know like if you want to have a a fo if you want to have the L_C_D_ display over there  or if you want to store a programmes with a keys What kind of things you'll need inside your thin inside W wh what W what Okay. Okay. Okay so in that case you can even look at the technology what the mobile phone is trying to use with the card. Yeah where they do all the wi with with them actually. How f cost effective it would be to put that car chip into it and do the programmable things. D well Well I don't know if it'll fit into our cost of twelve point five Euro you know. Is it possible to fit in to that? Sorry. Yeah that's uh that's something which I wanted to ask you also  like what will be the each individually the cost of it. For example if f if you want to put wood I wouldn't suggest for wood uh 'cause it's I think it's m much easier to use a plastic or a rubber rather than wood. It will be much ch much expensive th though it's the most natural thing  but Yeah. Yeah it's uh Yeah we we can give a preference to them  but it is but with plastic or the rubber or whatever it is it's much better with that rather than going for Yeah. Yeah. Yea Okay. Yeah sure. Yeah we will uh Yeah. Uh. Yeah.. Okay. We can give them smooth keys  you know. Smooth keys with bigger s uh So that you know The the problem most of the time we've seen  the keys is that it's small  and every time we have to be very but if i the if we if we go to a different ways of designing those keys  then you can merge them together to Oh you can actually  for example  if you see  they are they are they are quite small over here  and uh now you can  for example  as I was if you make them big  it may change the look of the thing also to the people. At the same time  it is m more uh like it would be more interesting for people who are having this R_S_I_ and all problem. Uh big keys may better for them actually and uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yeah so it's something like this  the model here s you can put the keys Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  mm. We should make a Yeah that yeah next meeting we should be Yeah that would depend upon us actually. Yeah okay. No no. I don't have. Maybe it would be interesting if you could look um for the cost inventories of other devices  if you're using speech recognition or something like that. Mm. Two. One for like cost and the one with like higher-end so that then we can be easily comparing them or you know find a compromise between both of them  yeah that's how it is. Yep. Okay. So we are done for now.. Okay so we are just waiting for Matthew. Mm 'kay. Yep. Mm-hmm. Yeah I think yeah the Matthew it is it's important that Matthew yeah is here because it's really a a team uh project with a team and if someone is not here then we cannot but it's okay it's good. Mm-hmm. So can you repeat and be more precise about what you just said? Uh about the feeling yeah uh yo Okay. Yeah. Yeah that's a very good idea  yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah very clear. To let the people choose  you mean? Yeah. Yeah a range of uh yeah  a set of three  four different aspects. Sure that fits the Yeah. Yeah yeah I agree. Yeah. And your part is very related to mine because when you suggest something then it has to be integrated inside. Yeah.. Yeah. So what functionalities do you suggest for that? For facing this problem? Okay. Mm-hmm. Oh yeah yeah yeah mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And you want okay for coming back to one point y you want to let the user to programming the keys? Some of them? And uh isn't that too difficult for the we want w I don't know if we still want the um R_C_ to be easy to use  that's the compromise. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A standard. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm yeah like I would say that for programming uh keys  you said  uh it could be uh easily uh done within the the package of twel twelve Euros  but for the A_S_R_ system  uh I'm not sure if it's feasible to have this or We Exactly yeah i if if it's a low vocabulary it's already implemented  and w how much it's cost  maybe with a f cheap chip. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. It's true. Mm-hmm.. I don't know how if if I have time to talk about the Okay. So what I'm gonna present here is very uh um yeah basic knowledge about the all the the components that are inside a a R_C_ a remote control  and how is it manufactured h what is the process  just to explain you. So the method is ther there is a a set of components in a in a remote control like  and uh what cost the the components in themself do not cost a lot but the the way to assemble everything costs obviously  and I will uh show you my preferences uh uh at the end. So there are two uh different types of uh um Two different ways of using the the components for making a a remote control. Uh the basic way is to use a an integrated circuit and some uh transistors with an that aims at communicating uh uh the message and to to send the message to the um to the led that will uh transmit to the receiver. And uh yeah the other components and the circuit board buttons  infrared  led  etcetera  for the components um. So you finding  just to say that the chip can detect uh when a key is pressed  and then it translate to the key  to a sequence  something like morse code  as you know  uh with a different sequence for each key  and uh uh that's  with the components we will use  we will have different uh messages  different sequences  and the chips sends that signal signal to the transistor that amplify to make it stronger um. So electronic parts are assembled onto uh printed boards uh because it's easier to mass produce and assemble. And uh so I think for our design we want some b uh programmable uh you know V_ V_L_S_I_ or F_P_G_A_ uh high technology  and this is important  and also we'll use uh yeah like in any uh high-tech uh devices a chip of fi fibreglass to them and connect them. So my personal design we need to find a solution what um what is the material of the cover we want to use. If it's plastic or you said that yeah you had some ideas uh like fruit  veg or I dunno. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah like they do in with cars I think. Yeah inside the car yeah. So they also emailed me that uh they have available a bunch of different buttons  a scroll wheels  integrated push buttons s such as a computer mouse. And uh very cheap L_C_D_s  so liquid crystal displays  so I'm wondering  I think we might be able to integrate L_C_D_ into our R_C_. And the final point okay is um we have yeah there are some uh compromise to to do. So we have to know that the push button requires a simple chip  but the scroll wheel uh and that kind of higher high-tech stuff needs more money um which is a higher price range alright. And the display requires an advanced chip  which in turns is more expensive than the regular chip  but I think uh with twelve Euros um and if it's uh uh made for mm four million uh items  then I think w we could be able to handle that. So to to sum up um we need yeah so I I just said that the components uh the list of components uh has to be uh yeah listed and um and um assembly is a an important process that has to be taken into account. And uh for the designing of the cove uh uh cover layout then it's better to to to maybe see that with uh the the U_R_ exp U_R_I_ Expert so that we can it's really a team-working uh. So I I cannot design something without your agreement  right? Yes. Yeah it's kind of um simple pro progra programmable device  and we have to insert. I think we could insert one that could underlie several functions of Exactly yeah  for customizing and yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah good idea. Yeah. Exactly yeah that's a very good idea  we could have uh one main chip uh that could handle  uh it's called F_P_G_A_ chip  that could handle both uh like scrolling wheels as well as uh L_C_D_ and yeah. Yes. Yeah also thinking  I think both uh if we had a budget of twenty twenty uh Euros  it will be okay  but uh. Yeah that's an excellent idea. Yeah yeah. Yeah because right now I don't have price in in head but for next meeting I'm sure yeah be able to do that. Yeah. Okay. I agree on that. Yeah. Yeah but i it's a detailed uh yeah yeah uh plastic versus uh wood  and we need maybe to centre our description on uh the the really the what buttons what uh functionality we want to offer to the user  and maybe with uh graphs or I don't know uh User Interface Designer you could maybe uh help us on that. Yeah. Perfect yeah. Yeah. Yeah customized. Yeah. I agree yeah  and not too m too many keys of course yeah. Yeah. Mm. That's what you mean? Yeah I like also this one. Yeah  the point is w maybe we need to also to make a decision on how how how big we want to be and how many buttons like n we should dec decide numbers or Okay. Yeah yeah yeah. Perfect. Exactly. Yeah. Two or three prototypes? Two? Okay. Yeah and find maybe a compromise. Perfect yeah. Thanks. Mm. Uh So I suggest we start the meeting uh without Matthew uh he's uh obviously late for some reason. Good. Um. Today uh we will uh talk about uh conceptual design. I hope uh you both did some uh some work uh concerning a uh conceptual design. Um this will be the uh agenda for the meeting uh. Uh I will take some minutes uh again. Um we will have the presentations of y of you different team members  and then try to come to decisions uh about the concepts uh you have presented. So and that uh will uh we have some uh forty minutes uh to complete this uh. So um who has the fir do you ha Anna do you have your presentation ready? Okay. Ah there is Matthew. So. Good. Do presentation ready? Oh okay. So did you manage uh Oh yes I see him  good yes. No. Okay mm yes I have it. Mm. Mm. Hmm. Spongy feel? Mm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yes well maybe Matthew can can give some more information on the Mm. Okay good  that's very clear. 'Kay. Um. Uh Maybe we yes well we maybe can decide later on um the l the the look and feel of uh I've it was a good idea maybe to to Yes the the the there are changeable covers  but on the other hand I I don't know whether my superiors would be so glad with it because you have to introduce a complete uh uh new l line of uh of supplies uh it would be uh very complicated uh organisational Hmm. Mm-hmm. Yes. Mm-hmm. Yes and of course it will be a we we get a if it works we can get uh after-sales I mean that would would be very good I mean those covers could go for for three  five Euro. That's a very good idea um And then uh maybe uh we can go a th Matthew's presentation because the Together indeed uh  because you ma might have some some information on the the easy to use  what you were already mentioning. Um yes but but I do maybe you can give a hand to us because I I'm not sure whether that that we can implement that for twelve Euro and fifty cents. I'm sorry to have Every time I have to come down on this price again to so this might be a little limiting for your creativity  but it's it's it's the real We have to consider it. S so do we think these ideas an and my uh sp speech recognition  I mean maybe it's possible for for twelve Euro but then then it will be at cost of other functionality we might implement like the uh uh the the the furry uh uh case of the Mm. Mm mm. Hmm. Hmm. Mm. 'Kay good. Mm yes um I would Yes yes you can you can still. We have time. Nice. Mm-hmm. Well well m m maybe m maybe we can give the uh the uh the case a very uh uh normal a v very normal case but  with the changeable covers to fancy it up. So like a normal cheap plastic case which can be covered up in  for instance  a wooden case. I mean just what Mm-hmm. Mm. No of course. So So I f I think we we should come to some decisions now uh a about this. Um so I understand uh when we want a display we need a expensive chip  but when we want a scrolling wheel w we also need the expensive chip  so can we use same chip  so with one expensive chip we can uh implement several complicated uh or advanced features. Yes. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So when the more expensive chip you mentioned there is is possible in the in the given budget  uh maybe we should go for for the more expensive chip  so all features uh which you mentioned can be implemented based on the same chip. Do you think that's feasible? Uh You th you think it's possible. Hmm. Mm yes wh when you make a a design ca you can next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price. That w that would be a very good idea. Mm. Good good. Yes but I can I think uh I think we can just use more cheap plastic for a kind of basic edition  and then people can fancy it up with with more expensive materials which which come with a with another price. Do do you agree? Ma I I think uh for next meeting we c you two can present a real design. Uh so drawing it on the board. And then we now sh only have to t to decide the general function uh. So um Let let's say next meeting w you produce two designs  one one one less advanced and one more advanced and with the cost price. Uh furthermore we go for the for the uh basic plastic case which can be later uh fancied up with uh with addit uh additional uh  how do you call them  these like like mobile telephones you can put a cover over it. But that that that that can be done later. We now can concentrate on the on the basic remote control. Um. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yes yes yes bi big keys is is good thing I think. No no. Mm mm mm. Mm w but then you have still have uh when you don't use it you have such a a an extent of your remote control which you don't use. So maybe it's possible uh  I don't know whether you can can indicate this  that you can elsewhere open your remote control and on the inside are uh buttons you don't use that much. Yes. Yes I I th that's what I mean so I mean something like like a book. Mm. Ju just make two designs  and the we we can decide decide between th those designs. I think that would be a good idea. So anyone uh any questions for now? Um yes I come to that uh uh Yes well m maybe uh  I don't know whether that's possible  maybe you can start evaluating uh their work somehow. I don't know whether that's possible uh in the given time but a as far as possible. So uh you two will be together w working on a o on two prototypes and further instructions will be uh will be sent to you by uh by email. Two. I Mm and then Hmm. Yes okay. Okay let's call this to an end. ,The UI and ID presented a prototype drawing of the remote control design. It can be used as a normal remote  but the speech recognition also provides a more advanced alternative interface. The speech recognition works as a finding mechanism as well. The rubber case is yellow with grey or black  with buttons either made of plastic or rubber. An extra button could activate/deactivate the voice recognition. The prototype proved extremely over budget. The main contributing factors were the solar cell and speech recognition. One way to compensate for the loss of features  but still attract their target group  would be to add more colour to the design. After the costing  the original prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad). The criteria used were fancifulness (2)  technological innovation (2)  ease of use (2.5)  whether it is easy to find (1)  sponginess (1.5)  number of features (1). Finally  the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (choices too narrow)  leadership and teamwork (happy with it  but they missed communicating in between meetings)  and means (SMARTboard was not satisfactory  but the digital pens were alright  but not too useful). The delay in providing costs of components was criticised. 
Hmm hmm hmm. Yeah. Okay. Yep  yep. Okay. Tu tu tu tu Hi  good morning. 'Kay. Oops. Mm. Oh sorry. Mm-hmm. Yeah  me. Cat. Where did this come from? Uh  yep. Thank you. Uh  maybe you can guess what I'm trying to make? Yep. It's actually sitting  so it's sitting  it's not standing. Okay  I see it as one thing it's very supportive. It's your best friend and your you can talk to a dog  it can be your best friend  it doesn't discriminate between you  based on what you are. Second it's loyal and third thing it's got intuition. dogs can som sometimes can make out between a thief and a person so basically these are the three unique features I think belong to a dog. Thank you. Okay. Sorry. Does it look like a dog actually? Mm. Eagle  okay. One point four or something like that. One point four Euro would make a Pound or something like that. Yeah. Okay  pretty huge margin. So then Mm-hmm. Yeah  that c Okay  you wanna integrate everything into one like Okay. So simplification of symbols you could think of. Mm-hmm. Menu  alright. Uh uh Right  I was thinking on the same lines you  instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user  may h maybe have an L_C_D_ di display or something like that  like a mobile  yeah and with menus. And if it's s somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone  people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe. You mean to save it lesser number. Right. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm  okay. S It might it might save a b bit of space  it's i instead of looking bulky  it might look small. But it might have its cost implications. Right. Okay. Mm  yeah. Are we we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that a bit better? Okay  that's fine. Am I supposed to be standing up there? Okay. Yeah  I've got Yes. Okay. Hello everybody. Um I'm Sarah  the Project Manager and this is our first meeting  surprisingly enough. Okay  this is our agenda  um we will do some stuff  get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other. Um then we'll go do tool training  talk about the project plan  discuss our own ideas and everything um and we've got twenty five minutes to do that  as far as I can understand. Now  we're developing a remote control which you probably already know. Um  we want it to be original  something that's uh people haven't thought of  that's not out in the shops  um  trendy  appealing to a wide market  but you know  not a hunk of metal  and user-friendly  grannies to kids  maybe even pooches should be able to use it. Okay  um  first is the functional design  um this is where we all go off and do our individual work  um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product  um what effects the product has to have and how it's actually going to do that. Um  conceptual design  what we're thinking  how it's gonna go and then the detailed design  how we're actually gonna put it into practice and make it work. Okay  right. We're gonna practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the white board  I'll go first  and um sum up the characteristics of that animal. So Okay  I'll leave space for everyone else. Um What's missing? We're running out of blue. Okay. I'm not gonna ask you to guess  I'm going to tell you that's supposed to be a tiger. And I see them as majestic  and independent  and proud. Now  who would like to go next? 'Kay. Is that your lapel then? There you go. Okay  thank you. Okay. Well  as you can see  the quality of the work today is um Gonna be a bird. Is it gonna be it's gonna be a bird. That's lovely. Okay it's fine. Technical help. Hmm. Okay  yeah. A seagu right  not a seagull. Eagle. Mm-hmm. That's lovely. Okay. That was fun  right. Um finance-wise  we've got a selling price at twenty five Euros  which I don't actually know what that is in Pounds  at all. Any ideas? D fifteen? Seventeen. Okay  that's expensive. I think so  I think so  I'll be able to um pull it up  or I could put it in the shared folder or something. Really? Mm. I think Yeah  um production cost's at twelve fifty  so half of the selling price is taken up by building it. Um  and profit aim is fifty million Euros  which is uh Yi yes  um yeah  I presume so. Um Mm-hmm. No  yeah. So yes  yes  I don't think we have to I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that  um making that a key point  just that it's going to be in the international market like Australia  America  things like that. Okay. What are your experiences with remote controls? I mean I've got we got um we had three videos  a T_V_ and a sort of amp thing all set up so we got one of the universal remote controls  um that you programme each of your things into  but that kept losing the signals so we'd have to re-programme it every now and again. I think it was quite a cheapie as well  so that might have had something to do with it  but that was quite good  the fact that you could You didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you. Mm. Yeah  the main that's the main stuff anyway  I mean and you don't want to I hate I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do and just sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that. Yeah. Um. When they're when you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording  things like that inside it. 'Cause it doesn't make when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at  it's obvious what you're doing  um. What about the older generation? What about granny and grandads? Um  my grandad can answer his mobile phone  but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that. I don't think they tape things  I don't think they use Mm  yeah  the age gap. Mm. I don't know  I d I don't like the  you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windows-based running system. I find it really confusing  I kept getting lost in the phone  I di I've not got a new one but uh my friend got a new one and I was trying to do things with it and I just kept getting lost  but that's just me. Yeah. Teletext has got that option as well. Yeah. Or what about kind of a dual function? In that you've got the basic buttons just for your play  volume  programme things and also and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures  obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that. Mm-hmm. I think that's a cost thing  I don't I don't know how much we're gonna know about Yes  no that's important. Okay. Mm. Yeah. Um  right  okay we've got half an hour before the next meeting  so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things. Um I think that's probably about it and then we'll come back and liaise again and I get to do another fantastic PowerPoint presentation. Sure. Okay. Mm. I would it would probably. I mean there's Sky remote controls and everything. They're kind of moulded and look a bit different  and the Telewest remote controls are silver plastic  which looks a bit smarter  so yeah I guess that's stuff we can think about. Okay  so let's break it up there. Okay? So  see you in half an hour. I think so  yeah. So we've got both of these clipped on? She gonna answer me or not? Right  both of them  okay. God. Jesus  it's gonna fall off. A kind of dog? Sorry? Uh. Mm-hmm. Please  please leave me a space at the bottom  I'm little  you can get to the top  with standing on a chair. I think it's outstandingly good. Crocodile? O Beauti that's Okay. Um  I'm very impressed with your artistic skills  mine's are dreadful. Oops this is now coming apart  let me just put the top in. I hope that clicks in  I'll just I'll hold it on  okay. Oops  oh dear  what happened there? Hopefully that'll stay on  two-handed version. Okay  uh Again this is off the top of my head  I was gonna do a big cat too  um. Oh dear  it doesn't look what like what I want it to be. Uh. It's not a vampire bat honestly. Uh and somewhere there's a body behind. That's my dreadful that's the worst yet  that's it's meant to be an eagle you can tell it's a flying animal could have been a seagull  I never thought of a seagull. An eagle  um again I'm thinking on my feet goodness. I suppose they're all so independent  I'd put that one down again. Da dum um. Indepen independent  right  did you say they're good at golf? Are they? Oh. Oh right  okay  I'm not good at golf. I'd say they're quite free-spirited  flying around everywhere  doing their own thing. And uh  birds of prey aren't they  oh dear  intrepid. I'll put that  intrepid. There we go  hope that pen's gonna be okay. Whoops. Seventeen. Seventeen Pounds. Should we be making notes of this? We can just refer to this later can't we? Yeah  okay. Okay. Right. So so I suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price  we d or or is it going to make our product look a cheapie-cheapie option? Mm. Mm-hmm. In our first year? Mm-hmm. You've got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be a um accessible and usable by sort of all age groups just t we're not focusing on business market  any particular thing  it's everyone user-friendly to everyone. Okay. Big target group. No. Mm. Alright. Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm. My experience has only been being given the remote control with the object I buy  not doing any tampering with it and programming  using it to programme T_V_ and uh uh videos and things. But basically on  off  volume up and down  channel one  two  th that basic functions  I don't think I could go any further with it than that  so  I suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. And symbols that you don't necessarily understand  symbols you're meant to understand that you don't. Oh yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Actually that just raises a point  I wonder what our design people think  but you know on a mobile phone  you can press a key and it gives you a menu  it's got a menu display  I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful  so you've got a little L_C_D_ display. With menus  yeah  yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too? Right. Right. So that's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with  that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps  and that's another issue how we tackle that. Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm. Is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books? Obviously it displays less on the screen  it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. The other thing is  just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again  it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top  your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Yeah  like smaller. And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone  it can still be lightweight plastic  you know? Something that's easily moulded and produced. Sorry I'm treading on your territory guys. Ah right. Okay. Sure b y yeah. But yeah  I mean it doesn't have to be that  you know th that was my main point  we don't have to use metal  I don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper  I presume it would. Yeah  yeah  yeah. Right. Okay. 'Kay. Do we go back to our room? Yep? It's sitting down. Yeah I'll have a go. Thanks. Alright  okay. Well since you guys have chosen the ones I wanted to do  I'll have to have to go for something a bit random. And also  my drawing skill isn't that great so  yeah. Okay  now I'm gonna have to change what is was originally gonna be because that looks like a beak now  so. Yeah  it can be a crocodile  it can be a crocodile. Well it was it was an at first firstly it was an attempt at a T_ Rex and then it sort of changed into a pelican but it can be a crocodile now actually. Yeah and uh I'll have to think on the spot of uh things that it is. Um uh scary  uh strong  yeah that's about it I think. Uh uh Wo Hmm. Okay. Uh S Uh Okay  some sort of bird. Ah eagle  right okay. They're good at golf. Yeah  no yeah  an eagle. It's about mm  mm yeah. Yeah  yeah  something like that  so that yeah about seventeen  seventeen Pounds  something like that. But Havi having said that though  if you wanna get one of those the the ones on the market at the moment they're s they're about twenty pounds anyway. So  it'd still be yeah  we had to buy one. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah uh. Use all the ones at the same time. Yeah  'cause you Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  my grandad's actually better than me at using teletext  so. Yeah. Yeah  what it just needs to be as long as it's sort of self-intuitive and you can can work out what everything's doing  'cause I mean  menus on sort of new phones now they've sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do. But I don't know how Oh yeah. Yeah  I don't I don't know how for twenty fi  or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get  you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white L_C_D_ thing anyway  I'd assume. Y Yeah. No uh uh Yeah. Just just a quick thing about the um about what you're saying about the uh does does it need to be fashionable? The sort of I I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the the uh we put the fashion into electronics  so I think think the whole design thing might be qui I mean you don't you you can still have plastic and it'd look quite good but Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. ,The goal of the project is to design an original  trendy and user-friendly remote control for TV. The team comprises the project manager  the marketing expert  who is looking at user needs  the user interface designer  looking at usability  and the industrial designer  working on the engineering and materials. The project will be completed with three further meetings: the following meeting concerns the functional design. The project manager gave a quick overview of the equipment available. The remote  needs to be produced for 12.50 euros in order to be sold for double that amount. The whole team tried out the SMARTboard  by drawing their favourite animals. Afterwards  they discussed briefly their first ideas  including the use of light materials and usability concerns. 
Alright? Alright. Thank you for coming to this third meeting of the uh uh design group. Um I think we uh made some definite progress at the last one um and come up with some interesting uh uh w suggestions for our our new remote control. Um I'll again very quickly uh just present some notes of that meeting. Um the the the problem with existing remote controls  we felt  was that they're ugly um and that people are prepared to pay a premium for something better. Um they've got lots of buttons on them that uh people don't use and find difficult to learn. Um and people lose them. And We we thought that f for our our new uh uh remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy  um that we're we should look at speech recognition rather than r rather than buttons  and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use. That um we want to go for uh a long lasting battery that we gua we guarantee for the life of the uh uh the product and a shape that will be instantly recognisable  A_ um as uh a trendy remote control  and and B_ as uh a Real Reaction product. So that w uh when people are uh happy with that  they will they will want to buy uh everything else from us. Uh Okay. So again um  I'll we'll have the three three presentations from the the the three of you and then uh we'll we'll make a a final a final uh decision. Um and the the decisions that we need to to make today  finally  are um what energy source we want to use  whether i it is practical to use uh um a a a long lasting one. And uh I I think our discussion was around the fact that uh if we're gonna go for uh a long lasting power supply  then basically it's uh sealed for life and uh if anybody does manage to run one down  we'll we'll give them another one. And uh it it'll be uh  you know  prominently displayed as part of the th the advertising literature that it's um um  you know  for life  guaranteed for life. Um now the the the internal chip um and uh this is where I need uh uh Kate's expert advice and given that th this has to to go to market as quickly as possible um d d do we go for a custom designed chip? Or or do we buy one off the shelf and and programme it ourselves? Uh I mean I'm I'm I'm n not an expert on these things  but presumably  there must be loads of 'em already on the market that we can modify. But uh that that's uh that's your area of expertise. And then the uh  you know  the the overall design of the case uh is is is Kendra's field and uh we we had some discussions last time as as to uh how we might go forward and we'll we'll finalise those uh da today. Um and thi this is all linked in with the the the user interface  whether we p um go for voice  buttons  or or a bit of both. Uh and then uh  you know  f for the next meeting Kate will be looking at the the the s the look  feel and design  Kendra the uh ho how the the user actually uses it and and Andrew of course the the product evaluation. And uh Kate and Kendra will be producing a a model for us to uh to look at. Uh so  if if we can have the the three presentations again please  and uh um p perhaps you'd like to start uh k. Kate. Oh I'm sorry  oh sorry. Okay  so how um sorry  can you uh just put that one back up again  please? Um. Uh d d d okay  I mean uh inevitably a b a custom design chip is gonna be more expensive. Do we do we know uh by how much? And and do we know how long it'll take to uh develop a a custom chip. Right  okay. Right  I think we need to make a a decision here. Uh given that the company wants this on the market quickly and cheaply  that would appear to uh effectively constrain us to an existing chip and thus therefore conventional button technology. Um uh now before we go round everybody else  does anybody um h have any have anyti ha anything to say about that? Cause uh I must say I find it slightly surprising given that  you know  mobile phones incorporate voice activated dialling. So uh um I mean I d d for slightly different well no  I mean  it's if you you speak somebody's name and it'll dial the number for you  so uh bu I mean the this this information is from is this is the internal company information  is it? So uh Yeah  mm true  again but if it's without any without any uh p price informations that's uh difficult to uh uh decide. Yeah  that's that's right. It's like it's it's you can't 'cause mobile phones are expensive  you can't say it's the voice recognition bit that is. But we don't know. Um. I mean uh I su i I mean if given that the um the technology is not well developed and and given that it's it's never been done before  um th th the double risk  uh perhaps we ought to uh stick to uh to buttons  since the last thing we want to do is present a product that doesn't work. Um. Thoughts? I mean do w do we think that the voice technology is fundamental to the project? I mean I think we Mm. Yeah  I I I I I think that's uh Yeah  yeah. Mm  right  okay. Yeah  it should be Right  okay  so. Fine. Okay. I it will have voice recognition um uh if if that means uh if that means we can't afford buttons but I mean b b second question  do we need the five buttons for channel change  up down  volume up down and on off  just as a a backup or just so that people can uh j j just sit there pressing buttons? Right. Okay. Sorry  d did you want to say anything? No? Okay. Shall we move rapidly on to uh Kendra? Uh um ra rapidly move the cable over. Mm. Oh good. Mm yeah  it'll get there. Yep. Mm-hmm. Mm  yeah. Uh-huh. Alright. Mm-hmm. Mm yeah. Sorry y y yeah  if I can interrupt you. Well d p 'kay  do you wanna say anything about um slide controls? I mean I think the reason everybody uses pushbuttons is that they're they're si simple  cheap and reliable. Okay  fair enough  fine. Yeah. Good  good. Yeah. So three three there's three buttons on a slider. Three buttons  channel up channel up down and Uh-huh. Okay. Um Mm-hmm. This one on the one side and one yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  or yeah uh th th the I mean thi this is what the we have to come up with is the the actual shape that people can ins instantly pick it up and and know know uh know what it's going to do. Okay  so we we're looking at sliders for both a uh volume and channel change of one sort. Just for the volume  uh. Fingers  yeah. I mean it's it's It yeah  I mean it it it seems to me that uh it uh it al also has the advantage that it it the two are clearly different  um that there's no no possibility of uh confusing the two. So okay. Right so uh that's sorry is that that all you want to say at the mo okay  fine. Mm right. Right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Well I I mean I th I think that what we're suggesting ought to address all three of those. Okay. Uh-huh. Mm I hadn't thought of that  that's different  certainly. What? Yeah. Uh. Uh. Also means you can drop it without damaging it. I I mean it its uh I that's an interesting idea  it's like the old Swatch watch where uh um on only batteries ever got changed in those  'cause people just bought a new one when it went out of fashion  but it's just never been seen as a a fashion item before. Um that's yes if if if they're made in sufficient quantity W I mean we we can uh uh b but I mean my feeling is that current power sources are such that for relatively little cost you can make it last  you know  a long time. Um but if we also make it cheap enough that people either change the cover every year or even buy a new one every year then it it's it's even better. S Yeah  yeah  I n I know the only p I mean the the the the immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that it it it y you've then got the connection and you've immediately got a sort of unreliability  whereas the advantage of having it plumbed in is that that the whole thing is all  you know  completely soldered together and it it it you know  total reliability  but I mean I d I I uh I know what you're saying and uh understand where you're coming from. I th I s I think if we're gonna go down that route  then we're talking about uh even if it costs slightly more than that  um just building the whole thing in one  then having getting cheaper production costs um and  you know giving people the option of buying a new uh a a complete new thing  the advantage of a replaceable cover is that even if they don't it doesn't have a cover on at all  it will still work um totally. Um then if  you know  if people lose the cover  I mean they they might be well inclined to go out and spend however many Euros on a on a new one um rather than a a complete new re remote. Yeah  I mean it is it's up to it's up to Yeah  it's it's up to our marketing people to to ma to ma turn it into a a fashion item. Um and  you know  as as external fashions change  then we get new new covers on the market and  you know  readily available. And um that's that's right  yeah  yeah. So uh i so uh okay. Um right  sorry. Um we hadn't finished your It's the sort of thing that we want people to have prominent dis displayed on their um coffee table to say this says something about me. Um this is fashionable. I  you know  I'm I'm I'm with it  I'm up to date. And you know  th the the design that I've got  and and it could be a a home-made design  um you know this says this is not just a a television remote control  this is  you know  a fashion accessory. Um  so I mean the the the basic shape i is is what we uh I mean given that we've got you know one one on off button presumably  two buttons for uh channel change and one slider and basically nothing else  um w we need to decide on the just the basic shape of the thing. And  know whether we go down the fruit and veg route  and I don't suggest we make it look like a banana  but um know sort of the the organic  you know  curved look  you know  t to deliberately get away from the uh um uh you know  the the the the square look of most um current uh remotes and  you know  whether whether the you know  the the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow. Um mm or uh 'cause there's certainly you know  the the corporate logo needs to be prominently uh displayed so that people s th looked at it and say right  that's a Real Reaction remote control  I want one of those. Yeah uh the the uh or or b Yeah  I'd I'd um yeah. Uh no I d I I agree  I mean we're we're we're simply it's simply required to incorporate the the the the corporate logo prominently um. Well  th this is this is the whole point  yes  you know  I'm I've got a a Real Reaction uh remote control to go with my Real Reaction coffee maker or or whatever. And uh then people  you know  people demand more Real Reaction stuff. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean I've uh yeah. Oh no that well there's the sim my my idea was something a b probably you know a bit fatter than this but sort of tha that sorta shape so that you can just sort of ho hold it. W it I mean well it's sort of it's it's sort of uh a a mouse  but held  you know  so it's you sorta hold it in your hand like that  i with  you know  and fiddling with the buttons. Okay  yeah  yeah. It's a very good point. I think we d I think we decided that w we're actually going down both routes. That um the we n we need the the manual controls and that they should be of that form  but that uh yeah. Then you just bring it up to your mouth and just speak to it  yeah  yeah. I th I th honest uh my personal view is that if it's not there  people wouldn't use it anyway um. It's cer it's certainly possible I mean  but they we we're going beyond w w given the state of the technology we want something that we kno we know will will work um. Uh Yeah. If we we're I mean I'm getting a clear message that we think that we should have those facilities available. Uh uh uh Okay  if we if we're going down that route  then we need some sort of display. Do we need some sort of display? We actually use the television  okay. Okay  okay  okay. Yep. Mm yeah. Okay  we got five minutes to go in this meeting  so um I d I think we've actually very conveniently just uh come to uh a good point to s to sum up um. So um b b Kate and Kendra now go away and uh pa play play with a bit of Plasticine or play-dough  whatever it is on the other side of the Atlantic. Um and actually put what we've discussed into something uh I was gonna say concrete  but that's a slightly inappropriate word um to something that we can we can see and um Andrew n can go away and th th think about how we can uh actually market this as a concept and not j not just a uh um a a simple remote control. Yeah  certainly  of course. I think I think we decided that we're gonna for for simplicity of  you know  manufacturing and uh maintenance that we will go for a a long term battery source um  I you know  on the basis that um that  you know  if we're going for making it a fashion statement  then uh people are more likely to change it anyway uh before i it runs out and um make an assumption that we we can aim for a battery that will last most people for uh we'll say at least five five ten years and that we'll w we will guarantee it for for five years um. We're having a a custom chip  but given the the we've cut the functions down  um that will hopefully not be too problematic  but given that um technol technological innovation is important  then we need to  I'll say it again  technologically innovate. Um and uh we we  know  we must resist any efforts to uh to try and water that down um. I i interchangeable case seems to be um um important to the concept. Um it it should be cheap  you know  if if we avoid any  you know  electrical connections. And uh i you know  i if we can come up with some way of of allowing people to actually personalise it uh to whatever they want  then uh I mean uh uh this is totally new. We d we don't know whether that to what extent people do it or not  but if they've at least got a a good selection of um covers that they can use anyway  and uh and if if we can keep them  you know  rolling  then uh you know  so they can get them in the supermarket when they go down to um a any of the famous supermarkets  I won't mention any mention any names  um it's uh it's good for the supermarket and it's good for us and it hopefully makes them feel better. Um the that I mean that's no  because we've got so few buttons that it that actually makes that redundant. Yeah  yeah. And the you know  that that solves one of the problems of b of battery life  'cause that would well that would clobber the battery life  so no  I mean given the nature of the buttons we're having  it's actually uh uh unnecessary I think. As uh as wide cer certainly wider angle than than current  so that if you're holding it  you know  anyway like you're likely to and uh it's uh you know  i i it will work most of the time um. Not like my my mum who points it at the ceiling and wonders why the th th the television doesn't work. Um yeah  I mean I d I th I sorta envisaged that if if this was the the thing  then sort of the the whole of the top would be the uh the infrared uh. Um so Yeah  'cause I mean the r reality is people are they're gonna be looking at the television whilst they're using it  the chances are  so if if they're holding it anyway  the they're reasonably likely to be holding it to use it  then uh then that that's the sort of coverage that we want. Um okay  d we're all clear where we go from here. Okay  so thank you very much indeed and I'll s see you all again in thirty minutes. Okay. Um Um p there we go. 'Kay  I'll just be talking about the components design. And Okay  basically I just uh looked at what exactly do remotes do. Uh basically they wait for you to press a key or give a voice command and then this is translated uh into uh light signals which are then seen by the T_V_. Uh the materials we're gonna need to look at uh the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery and the in integrated circuit chip uh works in conjunction with a a diode transistor or resonator  uh two more resistors and a capacitor and the battery works in conjunction with a resistor and a capacitor. Um. Uh basically what happens is you'll press a number or give a voice command and this creates a a connection within the the remote that allows the chip the chip then senses this connection and produces a signal in a Morse code format. This signal's sent to the transistor which amplifies it and then sends it on to the light emitting diode and uh which is then trai changed into a infrared light which is sent to the T_V_ and sort of seen by the T_V_ and which uh changes the channels. Um. Oh. Uh cool. Uh so as for how we should end up uh using this in our remote uh t couple of main questions are the buttons. Uh y the fewer buttons you have  I guess the fewer internal connections and internal codes you're gonna need. Um however uh to n not have buttons or to use a voice commands instead of buttons might make these connections more difficult and uh raise the production cost. That's something we should think about. Also we have to work within the company constraints  and the company has informed me via email that uh they're experts at pushbuttons and that seems to be the most uh cost-effective way of producing it. Um also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use  so I was thinking perhaps a combination of solar cells with a back-up basic battery and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that uh will last the the lifetime or the five to ten years and we could still keep that original idea. Um we also need to look at the chips  uh v custom-designed versus off the shelf  and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all uh seem to have agreed upon. Um  however that's gonna cost more  but uh the off the shelf is gonna be uh cheaper and it's gonna be allow us to produce it quicker and get out there faster  but it's going to be less flexible with the features  especially things like uh voice activation  which haven't really been used much on remotes  so there's not really chips out there that would be easy to uh to convert  so if we were uh definitely gonna go with the the voice option we'd probably have to design um our own chip. And that pretty much sums it up. Mm. Oh yep  sorry. Yep. Mm. Um I don't actually have any price information  no. Um it a lot longer than an off the shelf chip. Oh w yeah  we did the the problem is the the the voice technology is not really highly developed  it's sort of still still in an ex experimental form  uh so it would uh it's hard to predict the time. Mm. W just to to incorporate the voice activation in it is is sorta the trick. Once you've got the whole voice chip in there  then it's pretty much the the world the the sky is your limit  but to actually the the big step is to actually get the voice activation chips in there and working. Uh bits of it  yeah. Yes  as well. Mm. Uh it's fundament well I mean I guess it it's something we've discussed uh since the the sort of the beginning  so I th I think in in our in our minds it's it's fundamental  but I don't know that the uh the upper echelons of the company would necessarily agree with that  so I think you have to Hm. Mm. Mm  mm. Mm. No  that sounds good. Mm. Mm. Cool. Um Yeah  I I would say we do  yeah. Uh nope  that was it  that was it. Okay. Yeah  it's thinking about it. Yeah. Mm. Uh Uh I think they're they're about the same cost really. I I mean  I think it's just sort of the the there's a lot of slide buttons out there. I think it's pretty much the same sort of connection. Mm yeah. Mm. Mm. Ye yeah  'cause I've definitely picked up remotes and like meant to change the channel and turn the volume  or vice versa  so it'd be kinda good to have them be feel completely different. You'd know what you were fiddling with. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Yeah  'cause if yeah  in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the that for rolling  just the way it would Mm yeah  yeah  yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Well that can kinda tie into our changing uh face things  like we could have the fruit and vegetable theme this year and uh whatever happens next year  we can have the face plates  yeah. Yeah  yeah. Mm  yeah  that weird I dunno what that is  but yeah. Mm. Uh  yeah  it's good as well. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. I I think it's easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy a whole new one  because you don't feel like you're investing in a whole new product. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Oh yeah. I like that. That all c also kind of encourages 'em to buy new covers and yeah. Um. Uh yeah. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Well that that's just it with the covers  you're sort of tricking 'em into continuing to spend their money on our products without making 'em feel like they're being ripped off having to buy a new product. So  yeah. Yeah. Mm. Mm  yeah. Mm. And that's the sort of thing  once you get the mould set  you can just whip out different colours  different pictures very very quickly. Yeah  yeah  exactly  exactly. Yeah. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. I dunno that we should make the whole thing yellow I kinda thought with a you'd have like a yellow circle with the R_R_ in it somewhere on it  but I'd yellow seems a bit of a strong colour to make the ent like the thing no  but I mean just like white or grey or black or some sort of blah colour. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah  you'd want it narrower than a mouse though 'cause it a mouse you're kinda just resting on it  you want something you can definitely grip. So maybe it'd be Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Yeah  and fiddle around with it and press it. Maybe almost like a hairbrush  like you could get the about the width of that end of the pen and then it widens up top and you can fiddle an yeah. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah  cool. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  yeah. But do you know  this shape also kind of les lend itself to to voice 'cause if you're you're holding it and you're fiddling  but you can also bring it up like that and it's microphone-esque  yeah  yeah. Mm. Bu Mm. Well you can still i incorporate the voice with with less buttons. I mean uh if the power button was also somehow like a menu button you could press that and or do voice commands  and either volume thing could also be to scroll through other options like y and you could scroll through brightness and and sc and then you can you can minimise the buttons and still have those  you know  brightness and tint and stuff. Yeah Yeah. But the television would be the display that things like that usually c pop up on a televi like you hit menu and menu will come up on television and have like tint brightness  and you'd use the scroll  scroll through it yeah. Yeah  yeah  that's true. I never understood how that worked though  but yeah. Yeah  mm. Mm  oka yeah. Yeah. Cool. Play with play-dough. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm  does actually  yeah  yeah. Mm different to feel  yeah  yeah. Mm-hmm. Yep  yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah  mm. Mm. Yep  sounds good. 'Kay. 'Kay. Also lots of mobile phones have got a lot of technology in them  not just that  so. Would Oh I was just gonna say mayb maybe it sh like um maybe we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost. Uh yeah  it's the second most important aspect to users that the device should be technologically innovative. From uh my presentation show  so. Uh technologically innovative. Mm. Well  if you g if you if you got a channel up down  we can have a slider in that as well. Because if it if you no if you notice on the thing it it kind of like has got kind of if you you know it s kind of like sticks  if you know what I mean  up like one unit  if you see what I mean. So it kinda goes up one  then y like you can keep rolling it up  but it's like like like like a cog or something. So you kinda take it up one at a time. D Oh. Uh you could you could as l as like a mouse you could Yeah  like the shape of it almost like a mouse  with a Dep I dunno if it depending on the final shape of it  'cause you could have like  I dunno  it looks like you can c control the volume with your thumb  and then you could control the buttons with your fingers. Oh yeah  yeah. Here we go. Uh yeah  this is my report on trend watching. The data's come off internet uh from executive summary for us on the top three things wanted by the consumer. And we got reports from Paris  Milan on new fashions. And uh the most important aspect is the l the look it has to look fancy  look and feel uh instead of the current functional look and feel. This is a st well I was gonna say yeah twice as important as the second aspect  which is the technologically innov innovative um side of it. So uh and the third being easy to use is probably a given  we have to try and incorporate  so uh Uh exactly  yeah. I s that out of sequence? Uh yeah  sorry. Uh yeah  and uh from the fashion watchers from Milan and Paris have said fruit and vegetables are an important theme for clothes and furniture and shoes  et cetera. Uh sorry  clothes  shoes and furniture and uh a spongy material to be used on the on the outside. Yeah. But uh I was gonna say um yeah  fruit and vegetables  uh important to this year um important to furniture  I'm just gonna say uh f like it's in if if fashion if we're going for the it looks fancy  then fashion is obviously the line we gotta be going through. But fashions do don't last very long. Mm. Yeah. Yeah  we can have a sp like a spongy skin on it and then we can just whip that off and A kind of yeah. Oh Yeah. That's c cool. Um you have we could if we could save depending on the cost of the product itself  you know  could we have uh a cheaper b cheaper power source and then just have it annually renewed? Instead of having a ten year guarantee? With interchangeable covers  could just buy a new one every year  a new one when new fashions come out. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Or well  but like uh like more than just the battery  like a complete different like you've only got like  you know like th uh this bit's the bit you keep  and this is the expensive bit  this is like the chip and this is the microphone. And then this is the power source and the bit everyone sees. And then Yeah  you probably are right. Um oh  don't worry it's all said  I was just gonna say uh yeah  are we gonna make this as part of like like uh a part of the f like it it the fashions apply to furniture  so are we gonna make this part of the furniture? Yeah. This is fashionable with Oh yeah. And make that a fashion symbol as well. Yeah  that sounds Um I'm just I'm suddenly realising that yeah we're discussing how much how good it's gonna be to change channels t we still can just tell it to. I mean are we are we starting to get away from the the voice functionality of it? Yeah  maybe we cou like w like we're leaving out the buttons for the the f less frequently used stuff  but maybe we could incorporate that into the voice. Mm I suppose  but t there is the off chance that  you know  th the brightness is wrong on your T_V_ or the contrast needs changing. Hmm yeah. Yeah  that's a good idea. Yeah. Well I mean on a onto like a mouse  the ru the scrolling button  is actually a button as well  you could press it  you could press that and have it as a menu button. Uh yeah. Hmm. Uh can I just get some things clear just for my sake. Our energy source is gonna be long term. Cool. Uh And we're having a custom chip? And interchangeable case? Mm  mm-hmm. And uh are we gonna have it il being illuminated from inside onto the buttons or Cool. Are we having it that it's any angle  or is it just As wide as possible. Mm-hmm. I I just have a question about that. Um does it make a difference if there are just a few commands  for example if you um can pre-programme in like numbers one through ten and pre-programme say  you know  nine channels and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one and then you've programmed in say B_B_C_ four as your channel one  as your favourite  it's like to have a certain number of favourites um and that w Okay. Then it doesn't matter. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Of course mobile phones do tend to be more expensive  you know  hundred and fifty pounds or something. As opposed to the twenty Euros  twenty five Euros. Yeah. Yeah. Well  another thought I oh  sorry  go ahead. Oh yeah. Okay. Well  I kinda think if we're gonna have the voice recognition for part of it  then maybe we should have it for the whole thing. And we've been talking about it the whole time. Anyway  I'm I'm incli kinda inclined to say that we should just go for it. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I think so. Okay. Let's see. Oh. Yes. Is it gonna work? Okay. Okay  so I did some research on the internet and um what you know  the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users  um commands and mechanisms for the operation  and there're just kind of a variety of choices. Um findings  so a lot of times they tend to look cluttered and these were just a couple examples of um different kinds that are a little bit more unusual. There're some special ones available  like this one right here  which is marketed towards children  um different designs  and one of the things that n we need to watch out for is a V_ in volume because people some Bring a little picture of what I thought ours could look like. So just kind of minimise the clutter  avoid too many buttons and also um one of the things that people have used is a slide button  like you have on a mouse  that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume  for example  have the slide button on the side  and then you can pre-programme the channels  the voice recognition and then the voice response sample locator. Just because I n for example if I'm using a mouse I like to be able to slide it up and down so I thought it might be good for volume to just be able to kind of roll it and then have the up and down and then the this is my great little drawing. Y yes  yes. Yeah. The only advantage I was thinking of to having the buttons  like the buttons on one side for the channel  and then the slider is that if you're just holding in your hand  and you pick it up  it's easy to n s know  okay  this is just the volume and this is the channel. Yeah. That was Yeah. Um well I was thinking kind of just for the volume  but what what do you guys think? We could Yeah  yeah. B Yeah. Yeah. I'm just gonna pass this along. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Yeah like the kind you get on like hand weights. You know  that kind of spongy yeah. Yeah  that's true. Yeah. Wh What if we included the batteries in the cover? So um like Yeah  so can I see that thing? Just this as examples. So f Yeah  I guess that's true. Yeah  that's true. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  just another five Euro to get Right. Yeah. Yeah  like they have for mobile phones that are just fruits and animal prints and colours. Yeah  okay. Yeah  like an. Yeah. Yeah. Well n Well I was sort of mm kinda picturing like maybe um a shape that's almost like a mouse. So that  you know  when they hold it it's because a mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand um maybe we could make it a slightly different shape so they could hold on to it  but that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons and have the power  wherever  somewhere. I mean that was just an idea that I had. Yeah. Yeah  maybe. Kind of a c Yeah. Sort of a combination. Yeah. Yeah so yeah  kind of maybe maybe a little wider than this  'cause this is pretty comfortable to hold  and then if you had Yeah  then wider up here. And then it would have a l uh wider thing to uh have the light  the infrared light at the T_V_ and just kinda change channels and adjust the volume and the power could be wherever  up up the top or something. What do you guys think about that? Oh yeah. It is a very good point. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  and just say Yeah  I suppose I sup So I guess we could have a menu button as well. We could have the channels and the power and then a menu button and then the volume. So have four buttons and the volume instead of three buttons and the volume. Yeah  that's on the T_V_  yeah. Yeah  and then y Yeah  press that is t yeah  that might work. Yeah  it's like um yeah  it's like the mouse where you just kinda click it. You just press it. Yeah  and you could just click that to so if you had like the menu then you could scroll through and then click it to select. You know what I mean? Okay. Yeah. Yeah  I think so too. Yeah  and especially for making them so like different and Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like this or like this. Yeah  kinda like this whole So you could use like this and it would go. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Okay. ,The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented the prototype to the group and displayed all of its components. They demonstrated how the locator function operates. They suggested that a trigger button should be included in a later designing phase to improve the feel of the product. The Marketing Expert gave an evaluation of the product and felt that it satisfied his criteria. He suggested including a lifetime guarantee and expressed concern that the remote would only be used for televisions. The Project Manager discussed the final production cost with the group; after an analysis of all of the components the final cost was 15.8 Euros. The Project Manager then led a discussion about the group's experience on the project. The group felt that they worked well together and that they had room to be creative  but only after they changed many of the initial specifications. They also had difficulties using the meeting-room equipment. They were satisfied with the increased final cost and budget. 
Good morning. Sorry? Yeah  busy job. Good morning. So Oh  good morning everyone. I'd uh like to welcome you to our first meeting. I've prepared a little presentation. My name is and uh I hope you will introduce yourself uh in a few minutes  as will I. Um I'm the Project Manager of this project  and uh  well I will tell you on what actually is the project. This is uh the agenda for our first meeting. Um this is the opening  then we will get I will hope we will get acquainted to each other. We'll do a little tool training with these two things. We'll take a look at the project plan. Uh there will be time for discussion. Actually we have to discuss because we have to create a product. And then we will close this session. Um but first of all we I'd like to uh introduce you to this room. Um as you probably have noticed there are little black uh fields on the table. Um you have to put your laptop exactly in that field so the little cameras can see your face. Um there are cameras everywhere around the room especially here for your face  of course  and this isn't a pie  it's a a set of microphones and there are microphones here also. But please uh don't be afraid of them. They won't hurt you. Um well uh I said I'm the Project Manager and uh I'm hoping uh for a good project and uh I'd like to hear uh who you are and what your functions are uh on this project. Let's start with the ladies. Okay  so I. Okay  well we have some expertise from uh different pieces of the of the company. That's good. Um well I said uh we're working on a project and the aim for the project is to to create a to design a new remote control which uh has to be original  trendy and of course  user friendly. And uh I hope we have the expertise to create such a project such a product. Um the way we hope to achieve that is uh the following methods. It consists of three phases  namely the functional design  conceptual design and detailed design. As you can see  all of these phases consists of two parts  namely individual work part and a meeting where we will discuss uh our work so far. Okay. But first I will uh tell you something about the tools we have here. I already talked about the cameras and microphones  but they are not of uh much use to us. Uh we will have to take advantage of these two things. They are smart boards. As you can see  you can give a presentation on them. And uh this one here is a white board. I will uh instruct you about that soon. Um as you also noticed uh this presentation document is in our uh project folder and every document you put in this folder uh is uh it is possible to show that here in our meeting room. Um and yeah there are available on both smart boards but I think we will uh mainly use this one for the documents in the shared folder. As you can see  this is the same tool bar uh as is located here. Um the most functions uh we will use will be to to add a new page  um uh to go back and forward between pages  and of course uh to save it every now and then. Um and this is the pen with which you can draw on the board  for instance like this if everything's okay  but I first have to put it on the pen  you see I'm new to it too. Um and then you can write things like test or whatever you want. As you can see you have to move it a little bit slow  it's not such a fast board  it's a smart board but also a slow board. Uh but you can write things and of course you can also  when you click here  uh erase things  so we have uh est left. And um you can also delete an entire page  but we ask you not to do that. Just simply create a new one and uh start all over because we want to save all the results. Um does everyone understand this nice application? Well you can erase it with the eraser  but uh you shouldn't delete an entire page  but just create a new blank one. I will delete this one now because we don't use it yet. But you can of course erase when you make a mistake  but don't uh delete entire pages. And you can also um let's see I think it's here uh change the uh colour of your pen  for instance take a blue one and uh change the line width like to five. Um that's what you will need for our first exercise  because I'm uh going to ask you to draw your favourite animal. It's also to gets to know each other because um I'm asking three things  uh for that uh drawing  to do it on a blank sheet  with different colours and I just showed you how to pick a colour  and also with different pen widths which I also showed you. Um and a favourite characteristic can be just uh one word. Well I'm not very good at drawing  but I will uh go first and um try to draw Or maybe you should guess what I'm drawing  eh. Well it uh could be everything. Maybe when I put on this thing it could be a turtle  or a snail  and But a turtle has. And those are slow. And I hope our project group will not be slow  but we will uh work to a good result and do it uh as fast as we can. Okay  time for another animal. Would you like to go next? Mm-hmm. Okay. Could you write the words  uh underneath it? Or more words. Little rabbits. Okay  thank you. And our final drawing. Mm-hmm. Okay  well thank you very much. I can see we have some uh drawing talent uh in this group  huh? Well  nice animals  nice words. Sounds good. Um back to business  back to the money part. Um from the finance department I have learned that we are aiming for a selling price of twenty five Euros. And we're hoping for a aim of fifty million Euros and uh we are hoping to achieve that uh by aiming for an international market. And the production cost will be twelve Euro fifty max. Okay  well it's time uh for some discussion. I've wrote down some examples here of what we can can speak about. Uh what's your experience with remote controls  um what kind of ideas do you have to design a new remote control  maybe for which market segments should we aim  or should we aim for all segments. Uh well actually I'd like to hand the word uh back to you. What's your experience with remote control? Mm-hmm. Boring  it's not fun to use a remote. Mm-hmm. Well maybe we should try to make it fun. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So maybe a a minimalist design  the least uh possible amount uh of buttons. Mm-hmm. So you don't want to bother people with uh loads of buttons  but on the other hand they need many buttons so they don't have to get out of their seat. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay  well any more ideas? No? Okay  yeah well we have some time. Let's see what more I have to tell you. I don't think there is much left. Nope. We're starting to close. Um our next meeting uh will start well we're a little bit early  but our next meeting will start in in thirty minutes. In the meantime uh there's time for some uh individual actions. Um  as you can see  the different roles have uh different tasks. And there's a ping. Is it my laptop? Yep. Ah well that's good  five minutes and uh the meeting's over  uh right on schedule. Um the Marketing Expert will uh will take a look at the user requirement specification. The User Interface Designer will work out the technical functions design. And this was the Interface Designer? Or the Interaction Designer. Or what was it  I_D_? Interface Designer  okay  first guess was right. Uh will take a look at the the working design. Industrial Designer  okay  sorry. Let's just use the acronyms. Um and of course specific instructions uh will be sent to you uh through your personal coach. Uh well those instructions will be uh in the email you will receive uh shortly  I hope. And of course you have your own uh expertise. Well uh that was what I had to say. Uh are there any more questions? No? Okay well I think then we have to head uh back to our offices and uh start working. Okay  one question? Okay we're still going. Okay  well I expect everything will be much clearer with the instructions we will receive uh shortly. Okay well uh see you all in about thirty minutes  then. Thank you very much. Good morning. Well Well uh I'm uh and my uh function is User Interface Design  I think. So uh that's me. Me too. Oh. So we can't erase anything. Right. Alright. It's a sheep. A beaver. It's weird. It has wings? Well the snail doesn't have legs. Oh right. Well. It's a giraffe. Or a dinosaur. Yes. Giraffe. Should I uh Alright. So I can draw  but uh Uh. Well. Oh. Oh wrong one. Uh. Well uh you can guess what it is  I hope. It's a rabbit. And uh well uh it's uh quick  I guess. That's uh my uh favourite animal. A dolphin. Right. Well. With an E_. You can try out the eraser now. Not really. I always lose them. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. search for the buttons  which one is which and uh Well. Perhaps that you have a lot of road remotes r road con remote controls. Yes  perhaps you can integrate them or something. Yes. Your stereo and your T_V_ and uh. Perhaps that's an idea. Yeah  that's right. And which you don't use. Right. Yeah. You should just give it to. Changing channel. Yes. But you should make sure that you have every button they need on it. Because uh things for uh teletext  I dunno uh  w what's the name? Yeah. But But if if it's if it's international you should uh look in think in Britain they have uh different things they can do with the T_V_  or so uh that you can choose what you want to see. I dunno if you should uh take that in consideration  or that you just should aim for the normal T_V_s that uh And the B_B_C_. Yes. Yeah  I don't know if the they have that anywhere else  though. Yeah  we can leave that. Yeah. Well but but then you have to to find your other remote control if you want to search. That's not Yeah  that's right. Yeah that's uh. Well not everywhere. Yeah  you can choose the code. Yeah. But the people have a new television  and c if you look into the future  then they want will want the button  if their thing is broke. Yeah. Guess not. Yeah meeting will close in five minutes. Hmm hmm. No interface. No the Yeah. So So I should look at uh what you should be able to do with the remote  or uh  or how I don't really Right. Alright. Me too. Alright. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Good morning. Okay  uh I'm uh I'm the Industrial Designer and I uh hope to uh look forward to uh a very uh pleasing uh end of this uh project. Yeah. Okay. Hmm. Seal  a seal. A be Mm. With a tail and a mouth. Snail. Okay. Sure. The hell. Make that cute. Tall. B Bunny rabbit. Okay. Okay  um. Uh I uh draw I I've drawn a dolphin because of its intelligence. One of the most intelligent uh animals in our world. Yeah intelligent. I've I've uh Eraser. Pen. Well not perfect  but okay. A lot of buttons. And you always lose them. A lot of buttons which you don't use or who you don't use Complex. Not user friendly. Mm. Black colours. They use batteries and batteries uh and poor signal. Uh. Yeah  different remote controls  yeah. Uh for the use of different uh devices. Yeah but you could uh I thin uh there's a possibility to g uh to uh to put those buttons uh behind some uh kind of uh protection so that if y y you only get to see them when you need 'em. That's possible  so that you only get the No n n no  just Uh for example you got th uh the same size uh remote control you use everyday  but um the usual buttons such as uh um zapping uh as you call it in Dutch. Uh and the volume control uh are only the only possible buttons uh to use directly. Or uh the numbers  of course. But uh not uh the buttons used to search on the the channels on your television. You only use those uh the first time  or. So. Uh. Yeah  I think so  yeah. Yeah  uh teletext. think so. Okay. Right. Uh. Yeah I I understand. No. Yeah. When I think of it uh I think the main idea uh of this remote remote control is uh to make it user friendly. So uh I think uh when p uh when uh the customers will buy this remote control  they already have uh the remote control which uh companies uh uh with uh the the standards uh remote control with which comes uh with the television. So uh it only has to have uh the most used buttons. You don't have to integrate the buttons to search the channels on your television. In those in that Yeah but I but it is impossible to uh to accommodate uh accommodate uh all the buttons on the s on the difference different televisions sets on one remote control. It's impossible. Because uh for example Sony television uh has the opportunity to s to make uh uh to make it possible for to see on one side of the screen uh teletext  and on the other side uh just n uh regular television. Uh Yeah  but uh they don't use the same signal  uh on remote control. Because you can't use a Panasonic uh remote control on a on a Philips television. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay  but uh I think that most people uh th uh will buy the remote control because because uh the first they lost the one they lost first one or the first one is broken  so uh uh perhaps they have a got a an older television  so that option is not uh optional for those uh people. Yeah  yeah. So we should take that in consideration. Oh mm  no. Things'll come up. Stop the meeting now. Okay. Mm. No? No  the Industrial Designer will take a look at the working design  and the in uh usability interaction Yeah  okay. Okay. Okay. No. Okay. Oh. No problem. Okay. Alrighty. Okay. My name's. I'm uh Marketing Expert. My job is in the company to promote company or promote products to the customers. So I also h hope we have a pleasant uh working with uh with each other. Mm-hmm. S Good. No. Dinos Dinosaur. Beaver. Turtle. No problem. No problem. Mm. It was four months? Nice  okay. To make it a little bit easier. No  it's a giraffe. 'Kay. I think it's easy to r uh to recognise as a giraffe. Yeah  the favourite charis characteristic is that the long neck  it can reach everything. And I hope I can also reach a lot with this project. So that's my favourite animal. Anything else you need to know? Oh  uh Tall. So  'kay. It's a mouse. A bunny rabbit. Uh-huh. No problem. Bob Ross. Dolphin. Yeah. Complex. No. No. Boring. No. Black  all black. So  yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. The the angle you have to use. You had different remote controls for different devices. Yes. Yeah. Yeah but then again you you still have a lot of buttons  so Flap yeah. Yeah  okay  that's possible  but it'll get very big the the remote control. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. numbers. On and off. Yeah  play  pause  stop. Mm-hmm  of course. No. Yeah. Because I think a market will be all kind of people. Elderly p el elderly  young people  so. Yeah I think that's the better one  because I think if you you're going to target a lot of people and the whole world and only Britain then I think the cost will uh rise higher than the twelve fifty  I think. I think the aim is better to use uh the whole world and Britain  yeah. Not that much. Mm. Standard deliver. Mm. No but Yeah. Yeah  th it it's I think that's not Yeah  okay. No. I think n m n most televisions nowadays do this. So I think numerals. Yeah  but then you have to choose the this always with r universal remotes you have to choose the code. You can use which which type of television you have. That's no problem. But I think like the two pages on the same screen  like teletext and normal television  that's that's nowadays standard  I think. Simplicity. Yeah. Yeah  yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah g available. True. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Of course. Yeah. Yeah. Interface. Uh-huh. No. I have one question. Where does it says we have to make a remote  because I presumed She didn't know who. Okay  no  no problem. No problem. Yeah. Mm-hmm. ,The project manager opened the meeting. The industrial designer reported on working design  explaining how a remote control works and describing its main components. The user interface designer talked about what functions should be included. He suggested they should focus on either expert or novice users. The basic functions should include an on/off switch  buttons for channels one to nine  volume  mute and buttons for next and previous channel. He suggested that a trendy design should not have many buttons. The marketing expert reported on user requirements  including how users rated the importance of different features. He stressed that a trendy design is important  that users zap a lot  and that remotes often get lost. The project manager informed the group of new requirements. The remote is only for TV  should not include a teletext feature  and should feature the company colour and slogan. The group discussed what functions and features the remote should have  and whether to include DVD/VCR controls  a teletext button  stop button  changeable covers  and a base/recharger with locator function. The group also discussed making the remote a rounded  ergonomic shape  and using flashing lights to help locate it when lost. 
Okay. So welcome back. What do do we have to do? So first. I want to say I'm the secretary  so I make the minutes. You find them in your in the map in the From the group. There's the minutes from the first meeting. You'll find the next minutes also there. Then I wanna hear from you  what you've done. And after that I have some new product requirements. So And after that we have to make decisions  what we will do. And then we're ready. We have forty minutes for this meeting. After that we'll have lunch. So first I wanna ask the Industrial Designer to tell what he did. So Yeah on your computer  or the What's the name? What's the name of it? It's the technical function or the functional requirements. Working design. Working design. What is this? Product documents. On the desktop. Up. up. Up. Up. Up. Yes. My Documents. Nope. Gone. Well you Um Nah. Nah  nah  nah. PowerPoint. Working design. And Presentation of working design. Save as. Uh it's Project. Save. Very good. Okay. So Now have ten minutes to tell it. Okay. Oh oh. Two questions. The battery. You say one battery is cheaper. Why? Yeah but when you use two  you can use it two times longer. Okay so it's the size of the remote control. Okay and the buttons. When you use it on the television  you've you need the television  wh which can use it. S Okay. I think we have to use it also on other televisions though. So Yeah but I don't I think it They are two different things though. We have to choose one. It has to work on o uh all televisions. Okay. Yeah. Good idea. Mm-hmm. Yeah but there are much more Nokia telephones than um these ones. Yeah but are their profits bigger than their cost? Yeah but there are also design cost. I don't think When you have a remote control  do you change the cover? Would you change the cover? No. N yeah but I think that too less people would change it for good profit. So Yes it is but I don't think we have to do it. Okay. That's clear. Okay thank you. So now the User Interface Designer. We'll got back on that later. 'Kay  thank you. Then it's your turn  the marketing expert. Okay thank you. Yes. I think uh the L_C_D_ is cheaper than speech recognition. So I think that can be an d good option. L_C_D_. Yes. Only the L_C_D_. So But we'll come back on that. Now Oh  go on. What d d d um Um Uh we go back on the decisions later. Now we have a few new product requirements. First  teletext. We have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore. So not necessary. Next. Only for the television. So we don't look at the other things like the radio or something. Only the television. Third. We look at the age group of forty plus. Uh no  younger than forty. Is a g big group  and like you showed  n not very much people buy our stuff. Fourth point. Our corporate colour and slogan must be used. Very important for the design. So you can see it on our site. Next. Um no. We have to make our decisions  what we want to do. So like you said  we need the. Maybe it's good to put it in a document. Now we have to decide what controls do we need. So maybe you can tell us. Sorry? Yes. Yes  it's okay. Yeah but we don't use it. It's a new requirement. So  it's not my requirement. We have to do this. No. So what controls do we need? Who first? Okay. Uh power. Uh mm channel. Channel Zero to nine. Volume. Maybe it's easy to pick. What was w your one? Techno Okay. We had w uh no no no no. Where was that example of the Johan. That was the the the the the technical Hallo. Okay. What do we need? On-off. Zero to nine. Yeah that's the channel. Menu? Uh yes the n newer televisions ha do have menus. Uh M Menu. I think um the only one or two numbers. And Hello? That's ch Yes. On the L_C_D_ screen  you mean? Think it's better to have it on the remote control  'cause it it has to work on all televisions. So we need N Yes. But if we have this So now we don't have a lot of buttons. Is this enough? Mute. Maybe in the menu? Mute. Mm-hmm. Okay. Maybe more? No. Well. Then that's all. This will be the buttons. And I think that's enough for the next phase. So we can go on to Yes. No that's for the next phase. Um Phase two is the conceptual design. So then we'll have the concepts. That's for the So uh next point. Now we have lunch-break. After that we have t thirty minutes for work. And you can find the minutes in the Project Documents folder inclusive the uh buttons. No. Your individual action  you can find them in the email. So now it's time for lunch. Thanks for coming. That's my task. Okay. Uh I've Where have I put it? My Documents or not? Hmm. I've save it on my computer  my presentation. But where? Uh uh uh It was about the working of the remote control. Nope. Not a of Wait. The working design. But I've saved it. But now I don't know where it is. Hmm. Yeah. And I import this until One more. What the fuck is this? Yeah that's the empty one. I had one. Uh-huh. Open it. Okay here it is. Project. Okay. A little later but here it is. So okay. It's a little difficult what I'm gonna tell you. It's about the working of the remote control. I just had an half an hour j to study it and I don't get it. Ten minutes to tell it. Okay. I think it will be a few minutes and First uh I will tell you something about the findings  what I discovered about the remote control. The working bout it uh of it. Uh then I'll have uh some kind of map  and it's the top of the remote control. With a little bit of science  uh you I will show that uh in in a few minutes. And then uh what I'll think about it. First  the findings. The remote control is a very difficult uh thing to uh to explain to just all of you wh who haven't seen a remote control uh inside. Uh there's a lot of uh plastic on it  um because its uh not so expensive. And there are uh a lot of uh wires  uh which um connect the components in it  the battery  and there are um switches and things like that. There's a lot of small uh electronics. So it won't be um uh too expensive to build it. Only twelve Euro fifty I think uh we will make it. Now And here I have the top of the remote control. Uh here's some kind of chip. Uh on top of this  there are uh the numbers. Uh you have all on your remote control. And uh the teletext uh button. And uh here's the battery. And when you push the button  it will uh will be sent to the chip. And the chip will um send it to all kind of sub-components. That's what I said  it's very difficult. And after that it will be sent to the infrared. And that will send it to your television. That's a short h uh how it works. Uh I think I can uh make it uh difficult  but we all we all don't get it. My preferences? It's uh it won't be uh We shouldn't make it too big. Uh also for the cost  uh we should only put one battery on it. A long-lasting battery. Uh also for the cost  uh use only plastic. Not other materials. Also because of the cost  uh not too much buttons on it. We can also make uh a button uh with a menu uh button. And then um that that you will see it on the T_V_. And on the T_V_ you can uh switch into the menu. That's I think it's easier. And the bleep signal  y uh you told us. Uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something  when the battery's empty  then there is a bleep. Then you'll have to change it in a in a week or something. And also the bleep  when what I told you about uh when you lost it  and you push a button  and then you hear bleep bleep  and we will find it. This is uh just uh Yeah. Yeah. If we w if we use only just one uh small pen-light  then it will be cheaper than when we use two. Yeah but then we'll have to make the um remote control uh long lasting. Just Yeah. Yeah. But uh I think this our remote control is for the televisions we uh we sell in our company? Or is it also for other company uh for other televisions? Then this is an option. Maybe just a menu button to use it on our televisions. And then we make it easier uh for our televisions. And on the other tele televisions  you can also use it  but then we won't use the Yeah? Okay. Then I think uh the menu button uh will only work on the newer televisions. And we will uh look forward and don't make a remote control which for the older televisions. And I just uh have one more idea. Uh maybe it's one of your tasks. But Uh  to have a trendy remote control  we can also um make something like the Nokia um mobile phones. To change covers. So if you have uh a trendy half with all red  uh yellow and something. And then you can put a red cover on it. And also different things. Yes. Uh then it won't be uh will have just one cover on the uh original one. And then you can buy the covers. I think it will be a little more difficult  but not too much. Just like with the Nokia uh mobile phones. Just one. Yeah but then we'll have to to just um put five covers on it  and see if it works. If it won't works then we'll get something else. Then we uh won't g uh go further with it. Uh a p a a cover made in uh in China  it it won't be I guess so expensive I think. Maybe. I wi I won't. But maybe I think trendy people or like children where you can paint on it  and uh the the children think  oh this is my remote control  uh I made a picture on it. Uh Yeah. Okay. And the other people? What do you think about it? Okay. Okay. You're the Project Manager. Yes. That's it. 'Kay. Yeah. I have uh one question. If we aim for the younger people  um and there will be uh a lot of features like L_C_D_ or the the the speech uh f recognising  uh the cost will be a lot of h uh a lot higher. Uh I think we don't have that in our budget. Do you think? Like No. No. Uh-huh. 'Kay  we'll just have to do that. Okay. No discussion about it. Okay. Unfortunately. To change to the next channel  just one button. To move up  move down. But then we come to the costs. But now we have only the buttons. And uh we don't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like? Or Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. . Desktop. Yeah. Okay. Well. Make it. Hmm. Hmm. Will this will this add to the cost? Yes but you have to m uh be able to change it. D does it make it more difficult to design? Not much. 'Kay. Um Mm. Yeah. Yes. Okay. Uh um m Yeah. Um yeah okay. This bit too far. So So I'm uh gonna have a presentation about um the market  about um yeah what people think. Uh we did a usability lab-test with a hundred persons. And we looked at uh several um things. Uh among them design  uh d d how d did they like the use of it  uh what frustrations they had while using remote controls. Uh well what what will be our market. And uh we asked them if we had some new featu features. If um that would be a good idea or not. Well our findings. Uh our users  they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls. Um uh they especially found found them very ugly. And um th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it. Uh well they also zap a lot. So uh zapping uh should be very easy. And uh fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons. So a lot of unused buttons. There is more findings. Uh on the buttons. Which uh buttons find users uh very important and which which not? And how much would they use them? Well uh the most used button is the channel selection. And uh we asked them how uh relevant they think uh the buttons are. The power  volume and channel selections are very relevant. Uh teletext is uh less relevant but also important. Uh not important they found the audio  uh that's not the volume but uh specific the the pitch  or the left or right. Uh the screen and the brightness. And uh channel settings. Uh th and they also are not used very often. Then we have a few um graphs about the market. Uh here we can see what the market share is of uh several groups. Um as you can see  most users are uh between thirty six and forty five. Um the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big. And to come back on the the swapping uh things  uh I don't think uh  I I think the younger will be most interest in it. But uh they are not a very big group. Um in the we asked them  uh how would you like a s a new feature. If you have an L_C_D_ on the remote control  what would you think of it. Now you can clearly see young users say. I will that would very nice. And older user think uh they will be scared of change I think. And they won't like it. And another thing  how would you like to have a speech recognition on it. Well here we see the same. Young users uh think that's an interesting idea. And old users not. Uh well we uh found out that there are two several markets at which we can aim. Uh the first are the younger  the age between sixteen and forty five. Uh they are highly interested in the features  as you can see uh here. And um they are more critical on their money spending. Uh the second group is the older group. Aged between forty six and sixty five. They are less interested in uh new features. But uh they spend their money more easily. Now if we look back at this graph  we can see that among the first group is about um sixty percent. And the second group about forty percent. So the the first group is bigger. Well then I come to my uh personal preferences. Uh yeah the first question is uh also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at. Uh of course n uh saying we aim at the young group doesn't say that old people won't buy it. But less of them will buy it. Um well I uh Okay. What I thought  um even young people say it's hard to use  remote control. So if you make a remote control that is uh very easy to use  that's especially aimed at this group  even uh the young group will also be more interested. And um we can make special features. But uh I think it looks nice in the first time. But when use it  uh I don't know what's uh good thing of speech recognition. Um well th uh that's my second point. Uh less important functions should be discarded from the remote control. It's about discussion we had earlier. Um You can find most functions on a T_V_ set. So uh you don't have to have a lot of audio options  or screen options to change the brightness. And such things. Um well the design is very important. One thing I did not say I think  is that a lot of users also said then I would uh buy a good looking uh remote control if there will be one. But they found most remote controls very ugly. So the design of our remote control is very important. And uh yeah it should be very zap friendly  as most users use it for that. That were my findings. Yes. No. Okay. Yeah maybe we can first have a discussion uh on the the product requirements you just uh said. The the requirements you just said  maybe we should first have a discussion about that. I uh personally think uh teletext is a good option. Uh not everyone um who is looking T_V_ can go to internet when they want to see the latest news. Okay. Okay sorry. Then uh Mine? It's the functional requirements. D Yeah. Do we make a menu? Uh I think it will be um q quite easy to use  to have uh uh four arrows. Up-down for channel selection  and left-right uh for volume. And uh a menu uh button. And if you press the menu button you get into the menu  and you can use the same buttons. But the then to scroll through the menu and to change the options. Uh well yeah that depends on if you have uh the menu on the T_V_. Or you get the menu on the L_C_D_ screen on the remote control. Yes. 'Kay. But well if you aim at the younger market  um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab  uh they will buy a nice looking um remote control. And also to find the easy to use uh part very important. So if we have a L_C_D_ sh uh screen  and uh not too many buttons  I think that will incre uh uh even when it's a bit more cost  it will still sell. Mm. Yeah. Okay. Good idea. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah it's a good idea. But If if it Yeah  I don't I'm not sure if it will make profit enough to uh But it's uh yeah it's uh original idea. No. Oh. That's me. Uh Come on.. Ah. Yes well uh uh I shall give a short talk about the the technical function design. Um I thought the the the technical function design was uh to uh for a remote control to to to have some influence on the T_V_ set. Uh both audio and vide video uh in a cordless way. No cords attached. And uh well  it all by pushing a button on the remote. That was from my own experience and uh and uh the previous meeting. Uh I find some uh some interesting quotes on the web. Uh well the same idea here. Uh message to the television. And uh and and and well basic uh operations like on and off  and uh switching channels  and uh and maybe uh teletext or something like that. Uh well these are two uh remotes  and that's our uh our dilemma I think. Uh We just heard from the Industrial Designer how uh difficult it is. But uh shall we make a basic remote control  uh just uh swapping channels and volume and uh power button and well nothing much more. Or uh uh more functions on the remote. Uh maybe more devices you can influence. Uh a radio or a v a video recorder  uh V_C_R_. Yeah well that's our dilemma. Um any ideas about that? Basic or multifunctional? Okay yeah. Yeah well the that was just on my mind. So uh I didn't know what uh what way we would go. Mm yeah well that was my uh functional uh talk. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No. And I don't uh I don't think twenty five Euros for a remote is really cheap or something. So it's Yeah  it's hard to uh get the younger group. Mm-hmm. Just the L_C_D_? Mm-hmm. Well a power button? Uh the well um I think separate channels. So But then both the the separate channels. So so uh zero to nine or something. Uh volume. Oh mine. Technical. Mm yes. Mute. Um Yeah but then it's always uh more than one uh thing to do. ,The project manager opened the meeting by explaining how to locate his minutes from the previous meeting. The Industrial Designer briefly explained the internal workings of the remote   and mentioned his preferences for power source and case material. He also suggested mobile phone-like changeable covers  and the group discussed the profit in this. The User Interface Designer very briefly mentioned some features a remote should have and suggested it should be multifunctional. The Marketing Expert present the findings of the usability study. The group then discussed their target group  and what features they might include to attract them. The manager introduced new requirements to the project  insisting they were to be followed. The group then discussed what buttons they might need  which included menu  numbers  channel and volume changing arrows and mute.
