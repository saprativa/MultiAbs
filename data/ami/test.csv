Source,Summary
Okay  we Mm. Okay  that's fine. Um. Okay  now work a little with me. Okay. Well  let's start it as it is. Okay  uh the method. There are a few questions that need to be answered  uh you already uh talked about it a little bit. Which buttons are wanted  uh is our remote control universal or should it be programmable. Uh if it should be programmeab grammeale then we need um something like a mode that you can switch it. Because then the buttons have to send out a different signal then they would normally do. And uh how big is the remote control uh going to be? I'll tell you why that's important to me. Um there are a lot of technical parts in the remote control  so uh uh that's why I also would like to say uh go a little bit easy on the designs  uh I heard ab uh you talking about beeps and about uh video screens  but uh the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already. So keep in mind that everything that you keep uh think of  it has to b to be built. So it's that's not as easy as it s might look like. Uh material study  I'm working on that um for the the costs. I have to check out how far I can go with that. Normally  a circuit board is made of fibreglass uh and the wires are made of copper. Uh that is how it is done and all the remote controls work that way  I think we can just go on with that. Um then I've read more integration of materials means less cost for the production. The more we can make uh at once uh in one piece  uh that is cheaper. Exactly  so if we make a circuit board with the the connections already on it  then that's cheaper. So we have to make something that's not too difficult in design again. This is what look like uh looks like if you press one button  so this is not the entire thing. You have the the power coming in  then you have like a switch. The switch uh uh uh if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor  that thinks over a Morse code  that's how you should see it. The Morse code goes to the amplifier  then uh the signal is sent to two uh light bulbs. You have infrared and an interv um uh how to say it? Uh a light in indication  light that you know that it's functioning. Uh here again  that's my story about the different modes  if you do want to make remote uh universal  then the processor has to uh make up a different Morse code when some button is pressed. That makes it much more complex  so we really need to have a look  do we want that or not. Uh I don't have any personal p uh preferences uh so far  except for uh the materials to be used uh light  that they are light. That was it. Hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Hmm. No  I think this is a good idea. But Go ahead. Y Yes  I think so too. Yeah. Okay  uh Mm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. I have to check that out  I'm not sure. That must be possible. Ja. I'm sorry  whe where do you wanna hit the T_ you wanna we want a button on the television. In th okay  but that rules out a universal remote control. Because that's not possible uh. Uh. Yeah. Exactly. Okay  then uh I'd I'd like to know now if we want the uh universal remote control or not  because that's uh determines everything I'm gonna do. If not Okay. Okay  then I go for that. Yeah. Okay. No  it's fine with me  but then I know what to look for. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Exactly. I already noted that. Mm  okay. Okay. Hmm. If we uh make a remote control with changeable covers  then we can also make uh a cover for every language area. That's fo is uh especially for older people  that they can read it read it in their own language. That's okay  okay. Huh. Uh okay. Hmm. Hmm. Mm. Okay. Uh but I know that the buttons are like a Nokia telephone on uh one sleeve  so you don't have to change your whole cover. Uh we can make something that you can only remove the sleeve. Know what I mean? It works the same as a Nokia telephone  it's it's in my uh 'kay. Exactly. Hmm. Mm. Yeah. I don't think so. No  I don't think so. Because the television needs to respond to the signal  and if it doesn't know how  it's Exactly  that's not possible. Hmm. Mm. Mm. But that might be broken. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Mm okay. Mm. But I think there must be a way uh to invoke the more complicated functions of a television. For instance  if your old remote control is broken and you buy ours  then uh you should be able to get everything out of the television that's in it. Because otherwise you'll lose functions by buying our Okay  I thi I think so too. And I think that our r remote control should not look like uh any other. For instance uh Sony makes all their remote controls exactly the same for all their devices  and you always grab the wrong one because formatting of the buttons is exactly the same  only the labels are different. We should not do that. Exactly. Mm that's your uh division. Hmm. Yeah. Perhaps we should also make uh something like a flash on it  if you if it's lost  for people that are deaf. They they won't hear the the beep. Yeah. Uh. Yeah  it's true  but it's it's only has to do so when you press the button that it's lost. So. deaf people? I have another idea  I'm not sure if it's possible. Mm. Yeah  me too. Shall we uh also look if it's possible to make a rechargeable remote? That you don't have to buy new batteries if every Mm  yeah. Uh. But that's already possible. Yes. Yes. Okay. Uh you could make a device  but I'm not sure how that uh is possible with the costs  that you can put in normal batteries  rechargeable  but it you're the remote also can act as a recharger. So then you can choose  you have every decision. Know what I mean? You can uh put in normal Penlites  rechargeable Penlites  but they can also be recharged with the remote  with a wire. So but But I think that will cost a lot. Uh a normal wire would be better. Like a like a P_D_A_  a hand-held. You can uh just put it in the electricity and it charges itself  you don't need basic station. Yes. That is possible  that's true. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yes. I'm going to try to find that out. I'm not sure if there's information available on this  but Hmm. These are uh comfort issues. So I think people will pay they wanted to pay for comfort. Well  this is comfort. Yes. Hmm. Yeah. Exactly. I think this is a brilliant product. I would buy it myself. Uh. I like the covers. That's a brilliant idea. I never thought I hope if I have information about that  I'm gonna Mm. Yeah. I would like to make a decision. What it costs and what kind of materials that we can uh choose what we want in it and exactly  I need it. Was it not possible to uh send emails around the office? Not. Yeah  okay. What uh what did you wanna say? Mm. Mm. Mm. But that's the question  is it? Because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu. If it isn't  then we cannot reach it. I think so too. I think so too. Uh isn't there a possibility to do research on that  so we know that for sure? If you rule out functions  then uh and that gets known  then people are not gonna buy it. Then the consumer bond or something says uh you cannot do this and that with it. That's a bad bad com commercial for okay. That's true. Hmm. Hmm. Did they really said it like that? Those two things. Do they realise how much that costs? That's almost undoable. No  that's that's. Even if i if we have this lost unit  then we cannot do it for that price. Yeah  that's true. Mm. Hmm. Uh. Uh I But I really need finance information. We all do. Mm. Uh. Hmm. And the design  it should differ. This is Philips  huh? Philips has this. Okay. Hmm. Uh. Mm. Oh  I realise if we make it small  then it needs to be a little thicker  because I need to put all the electronics in it. If we make it s uh smaller  uh less wide  then we need to m make it a little thicker  because I have to put all the electronics in it. No. Hmm. Me too. Ah but. Hmm. No. M I personally would prefer it on the top. Huh. But it Hmm. Mm. Hmm. They want it uh. We should just try to make that if it's possible. If it is possible we should really do it  but we need that information. Also keep in mind again  the L_C_D_ screen is very flat  but it needs transistors  resistors  I don't know what more and that needs space. So I have to look if that's possible. But if we Hmm. Hmm. If we have a a space issue  we can also lose one battery. It is rechargeable  so we can stick with one instead of two. That might be an option. Yeah  but if we need two batteries and an L_C_D_ screen  that means a lot of space that we need. But it has to be a little bit heavier. Okay. No  but the things behind it. space. Like a process uh. I like this one more. Mm. Mm. I'll try to. One more uh thing I'd like to say  uh let's give this uh a name  and not like some vague serial number that no one understands  like with cars. Shall we all try uh to think about a name? Good luck. Yeah  I've Do we uh save the? Yes. Sorry  a little bit of pl little problem with computer.. Uh. Yeah  sure  no problem. Um there was a little problem with my computer so not uh the whole uh presentation uh Yeah. Um Okay  and I want to open the my s oh no. Oh no  that's okay. Uh slide show. Yes. The functional requirements  it's uh uh very important for uh the user  he he wants to yeah. The the method we used uh it it's not m not a slide  because it went wrong  but the method we use uh  um we tested it w uh with uh a hundred uh men  and we asked them to w uh what the remote uh f feel uh like and uh what what's uh important. Uh People  sorry. Both women and men  yeah. Okay. Uh the findings um uh seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly. Um Yeah  and yeah  most th th they want to spend money for a better system  for better remote control  so we can do uh a l a little uh nice things with it  and um they use yeah  they use zap a lot  um uh fifty percent say they only So that's the most important things. Um oh yeah  not all of it is it on mine on my PowerPoint presentation  but um uh the relevant buttons are the power  the channel selection and the volume selection. It's uh the most basic buttons that a user wants uh to use. Uh less important is tel teletext  uh um they use it  but it's not uh very uh important uh on the scale of zero to ten they six and a half uh and but not important is the channel selection  the the hmm? Oh  the the no no no no no  that's very important  but uh w and not important in the audio settings  display settings and uh Yeah. Um new preferences preferences. Uh um um beep to find your control  was that was in the test  the the most people uh f find it uh irritating uh when they cannot find a rem their remote control  so uh I think it's a bee beep to sound it and uh you can find it. And another thing uh they want was uh speech recognition um so they can say uh what they want to let's go to channel one and uh that's uh kind of things. And they want maybe an uh L_C_D_ screen um to to look it um wh what's on every channel uh and uh what do I want with it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Um Uh my personal preferences is uh a button for my favourite channel  so I can uh I dunno  so I can zap to my uh f uh quick uh to my favourite channel wh what I uh so  the remote mu must see or um must um see wha what mine preferences are for which channel  so I can zap t to What? Yeah. Yeah. Recognise Yeah. Yeah  that's uh what my personal preference like. No  itself. Maybe it's easier to to sell it  but I don't know it's manageable  but we will uh we will see. Yeah  it's a little bit uh it's the end of it. It's a little bit uh I lost it  the computer uh crashed  so. Yeah. Darn computer. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm uh. Yeah. Uh. Yeah. B Yeah  and they want to pay for it and uh With more Where with more technical specifications in the Yeah. Yeah. But oh? Yeah  with with an L_C_D_ screen you can Why? Nokia w Uh. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Mm uh. Yeah. Um Everyone uh wants to buy it  so we w yeah. Yeah. Or one. Or when you say one two uh i it uh it's enough  right? But Oh yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. But b But every Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Mm yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Um yeah. And uh with different colours uh. Okay. Yeah. Uh. And a light uh Volume. Uh it's it's fine  I think. Oh d Yeah. Just And L_E_D_ uh on it. Just a light on it or Very important. Oh  that's It's And But you r And you are reading from the t you always read from the top to the the bottom of it. Yeah  so it's Yeah. So i it's sorry? No  it's no. Uh. Hmm. Or or with the volume selection. Around uh not uh not at top at the around the volume selection. I don't know where exactly  but Wha No. Yeah. Yeah  that's better. On the right. Yeah. Maybe it's more ex expensive. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah yeah. Yeah  that's g But Which Yeah. Yeah. But Yeah  they want to pay for it. Yeah. Th uh there was not a el ask esque But But f hmm. Yeah. Yeah  okay. Yeah yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My computer crashed  so uh I lost my uh presentation  but I have the uh Yeah  but I Here I have the the s the homepage of uh our internet  and here is my here is my marketing report  maybe you ca you can look at uh that and Ah yeah. And one And uh wha what people want  I've uh I have another thing uh Yeah. Um Uh what I al already said is the the uh the remote controls are always lost  but it it's also for people  they want to learn it fast  not uh they want to No It's yeah  it's easy to learn wi and uh Um And The If Um If um Another thing I want to say is that uh we are looking at the market for the age uh younger than forty. Um on my report  I didn't uh ish I didn't show it in my uh presentation  because my computer crashed. Um they want to pay for an L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition. So i yeah. Yeah  and Yeah. Uh but If if they So uh we can We can look at the possibilities for an uh L_C_D_ and uh I dunno. Yeah. How much it will cost and Um It will come uh Yeah. Different colours maybe. But all Okay. If you're reading from top to bottom  I think it's better to put it uh at the top. It's j Uh. But i if you if you are going to uh put the L_C_D_ on it  I think it's very important to use it  uh because it's use it uh But nee the function of it. So you can use it maximum  because uh it's a lot it costs a lot. So Yeah. It's expensive to build it  so you must use the maximum of it. Huh. Uh. But uh Yeah  I know uh. In middle of it. In the middle. Yeah. It's the most import yeah.. Finish meeting now. It's on your computer. Uh. Or And uh what about speech recognition uh Yeah  yeah  but or or an L_C_D_ or an uh speech. I think it's L_C_D_ is better now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  okay  yeah  that's yeah  that's okay. Oh  good. Yeah. Same... Oh  there he is. Go ahead. That's pretty shocking uh. Which channel selection? Oh  okay. Is that manageable? 'Cause it sounds pretty expensive too. Okay. Okay. Shall I go? Okay. So  some technical functions. Basically I have some issues which you discussed earlier. Uh let's just start with the method. It sounds really easy  what does the user do  what does the th remote control do  but there are quite some issues. So the things I'm going to concentrate on are the user aspect  because the technical aspect  that's pretty much covered. We can do that. What goes wrong at the user. Gets the remote control. Where is the remote control? We've all had it once  I want to watch some television  where's the remote control? That was one of your ideas which you posted in the network folder  a really good idea. Uh these are just the issues. I come to some uh personal experience  findings  possible solutions later. Searches for the button. There are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear. Uh so either we lose those or we try to make it a little bit more clear. Uh also symbols tend to fade after a while. There's nothing more annoying than faded symbols  because you don't know which channel is this button  so possibly we could find uh something for that  yes. Uh covered that. Oh yes  user presses the button. Um usually when you have a lot of buttons  buttons are small. So you press more once remote control goes kablouey or something like that  so we have to pay attention not to put too mun too many buttons on uh the remote control. And possibly also the size  so more important buttons  bigger si So this is basically what I h had in mind in the fade-proof symbols  locator  a sound  uh so clear we should stick to existing symbols  but maybe we could do a little uh investigation to see whether some symbols are uh need to be replaced by others. Uh This I pretty much covered. So what we want to go to is not this one  but more less buttons  easy  some bigger buttons. So that's basically uh what I had in mind. This is not the final design  this is just a general idea of how I'd like to see uh basically the general idea. So that was it. Yeah  I think it's a really good idea. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Oh. Is it manageable? Is it easy? Yeah. And it costs too much to fabricate  so we're on a tight budget here. And it's Maybe just a slap-on sticker with a button which sends out a small signal. Yeah  exactly. And it's Besides that  the technology isn't really super yet  so that is a problem in implementing this. It's a good idea  but it's just not I don't think the market's ripe for that yet. But should the exchangeable covers include the buttons themselves or just the C that's a problem with the with the text then. Oh yeah  I know what you mean. Yeah. Pretty straightforward. Is it techni technically possible to uh send a signal to a television and then pops up a menu  because we're working with different types of television  so we're going to work with that? It's an in-built menu  isn't it? Yes. So basically we Or we could use a double-sided for less used functions you Yeah  with the cover. I it's basically an idea to overcome these issues  because No  but basic functions but functions which are not frequently used. Because if we use a universal remote control  we're going to have to have most buttons on it  so Yeah. Yeah  I have some ideas. I have some ideas. I'll put some on paper and present them next time uh the ideas that I have. I heard a beep go. Yeah  but we like some some curves or Yeah. Oh  we get the general ideas  yes. Yeah  and since you're holding it like this  I suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume yeah yeah. So you have the up channel the down channel the volume  do we want that horizontal or vertical? This is basically what people are accustomed to  so Yeah  but this is just a g general idea. Uh maybe the menu button can go i in the middle. Whoa. You won't be able to find it. We could make a combination that it goes beep and that you that some light lights up. So we have the basic channels we've got here  uh the power button somewhere over here? I usually press it on top. At least that's what I'm accustomed to. What would you like to? Okay  mute button. Is that somewhere here? Is that used often? The mute button? Do people use that often? 'Cause uh I'm pretty much accustomed to it right over here  at least in general  but It's not that important  no. Sure. That's pretty much what people are accustomed to  aren't they? Well  I'm accustomed to the channels being on top. But isn't that expensive in the entire package? But again  isn't that too expensive? 'Cause that means that we have to implement rechargeable batteries  a docking station And do people actually want that? To pay extra they want to pay for rechargeable? Can can we save this or Yeah. Could you post some other essentials of what people want  so that I can work with some buttons  where to put it You seem to have information on that  I'd like to uh see some of it. No  it's not. No. Oh  your computer. Okay. Well  I have your PowerPoint presentation  I can get some inf information out of that. Let's see. Oh  where would we Where would we want the uh teletext button? Because we decided that it's n not that important. Do we put it somewhere over here? Or maybe this is something for the next meeting  I can draw out some ideas. Yeah. Well  we have decided more or less the basic structure. I can put the other buttons in Yeah. Yeah. Maybe another idea uh. Yes  but it should cover all the functions  so possibly  just an idea that popped in Yeah  but we could go a step further  because some T_V_s have the uh possibility to adjust brightness  that kind of menus. Yes  but it Because we're making We need to adjust to the technology. True. No  I thi Oh  we're not going to be able to sell it for twenty-five then  with an L_C_D_ screen. Well I doubt it  but Well  I had basically Something like this. To make it kind of futuristic. So what kind of Yeah  sure. Now it's pretty much tucked away in your hand. I'm I'm still not convinced of the Yeah. So basically can I what we have to decide now is uh what goes on top. Do we put the volume control and the channel control here  or do we put it on he Would we like to press it in the middle? Yes  but we do agree that we keep this at the centre  because it's basically the most important function. Well  that would make them quite small. So maybe you'd put them here. Yes  but a big remote control probably not something which people would like. So would we like this or would we like the Let's see what we have here. Okay. So I think of a name. So Yes  go and finish up and I'll see you at lunch. Yeah. Wait for the marketing director actually  so. Anyways. Uh. See  shall we wait? I'm not sure if he's late or delayed or whatever  so I'm gonna start soon  we have now don't have much time anyway. There you are  okay. Uh no problem. We're about to start  so have a seat. Okay  welcome again. Today  functional design phase. I'll take you over the minutes of last last meeting. Okay  that was just to get to know each other  have a little thoughts on what your vision is and on this project  so I put the minutes on the I made on the on the p the the project share  so if you wanna review them  they're there. I will do so after every meeting  so if you have some information you wanna take back you can find it there. Anyways  um today three presentations  from every one of you. Um after that I got some new project requirements from project board  so we're gonna go af go after over this later. But I wanna start with uh stuff you did first  so we can see what everybody came up with. And after that we can have the new requirements and share some thoughts  so. Who would like wanna go first? Take it. Anyway  let's see what you have. Uh it's still a bit open. You should close it on your own notebook  I guess. Yeah. So there? Okay. If I can cut in  is it people or men? Is it people  okay. 'Cause I thought it was only men  so 'Kay. So we have to s we have to do something about that. Okay. Okay  just talk ahead. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay  that's okay. That's a little weird. Okay  we can we can hide those under a menu or something  okay. That's like a button on your T_V_? Remote  okay. Okay. We wanna have a little preview on the remote control. Preview what's on the channel. Okay. That sounds too It's possible  but uh I think it's expensive  but do continue. Okay  you don't set it yourself  it just remembers the channel that you are on most  for example. You want the you want it to be programmed  for example y programmed f or you want it to recognise your favourite channel? Let's see  you you spend twenty minutes each day on that channel  so it recognises your favourite channel. Okay  so it's it it does it recognise itself  you don't have to set it Okay. Okay. I see. Okay. No problem  it's it's okay  that's Yeah  go ahead. That seems very good. Mm-hmm. Okay  so have it more make it more durable actually. Okay. Okay  so the buttons should be Mm-hmm. Yeah. Wow. The s Yeah. Make it make them bigger. Even more durable uh. Okay. Yeah  it's true. Yeah  that's clear. No  of course uh Yeah. I must say that it Hmm. That was it. Okay  that was good. So we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere and increase it the durability of of the thing  so The other aspects  we'll just see how what you came up with and what's possible for that budget. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Of course  hmm. You mean integrate them all into the circuit board. Okay. Yeah  okay. So you have Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. That was it? I'll get back to my thing then. Uh Okay  back this up to the screen. So I got some new information on the project specifications are changing a little. Like you said uh teletext is not not very popular anymore because the uh the internet  nowadays people don't use the teletext anymore or hardly  so it can either Well  I don't think we should remove the button  because there are always people who are using it. But I don't think it should be very it should be one of the big buttons for example. Just put it somewhere or under second option or whatever. It's not important anymore. Um we're targeting young people now  because our um This is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people  which are um the younger people were defined under forty. I so I think it's that's also good with the fashion and everything  so yeah. They want to pay for it  people are willing to spend money actually to buy a um remote that they like. If they like the way it looks  the way it functions  so they're actually gonna spend uh spend money on it. Yeah. see how far we can go with it anyway  so And one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable  which is apparently black and yellow  but I'm not sure if we I think we should keep the the logo in mind  because with colours you can uh have a lot of uh fashionable colours and everything on it  which suits everybody's taste. So With that concept I started thinking  so why not just steal Nokia's idea and just make changeable covers for your I mean those cost hardly anything I think  and people could even spend extra money on buying a cover and so have an entire new remote control that they like to see. Or we can sh for example we can make a different a basic design. And sell the covers separately  for example. That's just a little marketing idea that could be applied  so you can p it appeals to really everyone. So you don't have to I think you don't have to make entire remote controls. We make a basic one and manufacture this cover separately. So that was that was my idea on what we could do to appeal this product to everyone. So just I'm not sure if you came up with anything in the meantime  after making a presentation. Would you like to share? Okay. Oh yeah. I think we should lose the L_C_D_ screen  like you said. I think for example it's it's huge I think the L_C_D_ is huge  it consumes batteries like hell. I think it takes up a lot of a lot of power. It costs a lot  I think. What we could do  what could be possible  is maybe not an L_C_D_ screen but with a preview  but y I'm not sure if it's even possible. For example  a little T_V_ guide. Like you have a little just just a text only  not colour  just a little text thing so you can use your remote as a T_V_ guide. I'm not sure it's even possible  but maybe okay  make it Yeah  find a little compromise in that  but What did I write down? I think the p yeah  the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement  just make a button on your T_V_ and just hit the button  it beeps somewhere. I think it's easy to implement  we should go for that. Uh speech recognition. I thin Yeah  I mean where else should you put it? Yeah  but how are you gonna use that if your I mean if your remote control is lost  how are you gonna press where are you gonna press the button? A slap-on sticker. Oh  you mean as like a separate thing you can attach to your T_V_. Yeah  that could be possible. A little little box you can attach to your T_V_ is fine then  okay. I think it's universal. I think we should go for universal  because apparently we're a separate company making separate c remote controls to sell to a lot of diverse people. I think universal remote control should be possible. Yeah  I think we're targeting everyone  so remote Okay  universal is good. Speech recognition  I think it's very hard  because we're selling across multiple countries. So I think implementing speech recognition is such a small um apparatus  it's very hard to do. Yeah  but I don't see Arabian people speaking one  two uh whatever. It's Yeah. It's not a mature technology  I think it takes a lot of memory and everything in in a remote control  so I don't think it should be implemented in a remote control yet uh. What else do we have? Um well you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable. So the the the symbols won't fade  maybe a little harder plastic or especially li we don't maybe we don't have have to do all the buttons  but especially the ones that are um the popular buttons  so those always fade first. Mm the thing is the most important things that we have now. Let's see. For example? Well  we're not we're not targeting older people  we should remember that. Everything we target is under forty  so. You assume that that they read correctly and I think they're The most important thing about young people is that they're really sensitive to to trends that are passing through the world  so No  of course. No  I think it's just something you you put over them  because Yeah we c Yeah  you ca Well  tha that's not a that's not a bad that's not even it's not even a bad idea. I mean  for example  if you're if you're into the durability issue you could For example  if your buttons are faded  after I mean if you make a durable remote  they are faded  you can just buy a new cover. Uh I'm not sure it's it's hard to make. So it's a good and a bad idea. Mm-hmm. Yeah  I know  it's just just a one one piece of rubber for example  okay. Yeah  that's what I something I have to look into. Either either change both the buttons and and the cover or just the cover  I'm not sure which which is easier  so Um anyway  yeah  this is what we're gonna do afterwards  just lunch break and have more individual work after that  so let's see what we let's see we So you have to come up with a components concept  yeah. I want some you should do some trend-watching  because even if we're if we're gonna do those covers and everything  what people really want  that's what we need to know in this phase  because that's gonna be the essential final design that we're gonna come up with. Um Yeah  I think user interface is fairly obvious. I mean it should be very intuitive  s Yeah  it should speak for itself. Uh for example I bought a remote control last week with a new T_V_  it was it l it's like all buttons and you have no idea what it does at first  and I'm total T_V_ new  anyway. So I think it should be have less or l very little buttons and maybe a second second level menu for the advanced things. Or maybe just stick 'em under a menu  like you said the um the sound options and the surround and whatever  they're more complicated  just stick 'em under one menu and uh give it a just put it in in s in a software piece  you can menu and you can uh select everything you want to to set on your T_V_. That is true. No  that's true. Yeah  that's true. I'm not sure if it's impossible  but uh there's a chance it's not  so. A double-sided remote control? I don't think that's useful. Yeah  but then you're gonna have a lot of wasted buttons. For example you have a Sony T_V_ and the half of the buttons won't function if you have a for a Sony that won't for a Philips T_V_. I don't think we should Yeah  for exam I'm not s yeah  for ex you have to make it a little decision between the part if you want a universal remote control that it should do what people usually do with their T_V_s  not not the very complicated settings that you can usually do that with uh either a old old remote control if they really hate that thing  but you can't you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of T_V_s. I think there's I think there is a standard for example between uh because usually the the menu is the menu button is is usable between different brands. Especially the big ones  the big brands  so. 'Cause everybody I have a universal remote control and it can use the menu button  so I think I'm not sure  if you can put some research into that  if it's possible. Uh I think just a b and the navigation is very basic  it's usually the same thing. Yeah. Yeah  that's true. I think so uh we need to put some research into that if if we can open the menu  I think it's possible  just the way how to. Yeah  then then you could do everything I suppose  because usually the T_V_s have tha that inside in this other little piece of software  so it's okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah I think it should be a little distinct from everything else  because it's either it's both mayb maybe the shape can be a little different. Maybe it's a little more curves or whatever. So um Yeah  this. Not sure what because we have forty minutes  I'm not sure how much time we have left for the meeting anyway  so. Yeah  but it wasn't me  it was him closing something. So anyway  yeah  we could do some i do some work now on on the design for example. I mean what do you want  do you want  but Yeah  may maybe something like this. But though smooth inside. So you have the transmitter here for example. Let's see that you what would be handy. I think that the the buttons should be the channel buttons should be uh on their own. Let's see one  two God damn it. Yeah  okay. Another one here. Let's see what I think this should these are always on top of the of the control  so they should be here. Think it's like this. Withi within the Yeah  just take it. Do you take triangles or Um I think it should be I think it Maybe we should make 'em bigger or whatever. Yeah. Yeah  in the middle. It's it's usually uh there  but Mm. Yeah  but for example if it's lost in your armchair  we'll not see the flash. And flash takes up a lot of batteries again. Yeah. Yeah  I thought about for deaf people for example  so. We could do that. Uh let's see. Oh yeah  it's true. Um that thing should be central. You shouldn't be you uh shouldn't press it by accident  but it shouldn't be stacked away somewhere. Yeah. Yeah  like that's gonna work. Yeah  I thought maybe we should move the buttons down and put it here for example to From top to bottom. Yeah  that's true  you should I think the bu the power button should be on top  'cause it's the first thing you do  turn it on. So power button on top. Um Mute. Do we hardly I think it should be at the bottom somewhere. Mute. Turn the sound off. I don't think it's important  but I think it I think it should be you c you could put it somewhere here. No  because it Yeah  people are accustomed to that  it's Can I have that? That's j Take this out and here see Uh are we gonna take triangles anyway? I'm drawing triangles  but Yeah  it's maybe a bigger lesser than thing. So anyway  I think this is should be the channels and or sh Here  okay. Okay  should we chan okay  this two  channel up and down. Well  for that is it's on one part it's um it's a good thing to recharge it Maybe we should what what could be possible is one with rechargeable batteries for example. You have just put Penlite batteries that are rechargeable  because it's an it's it's it's very annoying. I'm not sure y I'm not sure it's if it's expensive  but just take a look at it  because it might be a very good idea. Because if it's it's uh useful to have it rechargeable  but at the same time  if you don't want recha if you forgot to recharge it and you wanna watch T_V_ now  you wanna be able to put different batteries in it  use it now and not in half an hour. How about I think I have a nice idea. Not exactly uh. I think it's uh it's a pretty good idea to have uh like sort of a maybe a base station that you put on the T_V_. Could be flat  you could insert your uh remote into it. I'm not sure. A what? Well  we were talking about the fact that we wanted to insert either a beep or a flash into the thing with a little separate signal or So you could put that on a T_V_ for example. It could be very flat  could be very small. It's a very small Yeah  I'm drawing it big now  but So you can put your remote on flat for example. And at the backside of remote just just just a little hole for example um you just put it down  it recharges for example. I don't think it's very expensive. I'm not sure if it costs a lot  that that's what he r That's that you that's what you buy yourself. It's just an idea  we have to find out if it's possible. Do they want but they want a rechargeable one? I'm not sure  you should find out if it's if rechargeable is important. Yeah. They want to pay for comfort  we just assu we we could either make a separate station which just sends a signal to the remote control to either beep or flash to find it  um and Yeah  we have to either that or make it integrated with a with a docking station. I think it would be good actually. I like the beep part anyway. So um let's go through the Covers is covers is good. Yeah  it's Oh we can save this. Up and saved. We even saved the ant. Um Okay. So what we have is you have I think you have to do a lot of work on if it's possible for the cost. Maybe yeah  or maybe you can find out i what people are willing to pay. We are going for twenty five Euros sales price  but just try to find out what they're willing to pay for it  because if they're willing to pay more  we could lose a little profit and maybe attract more customers  uh we just have to see what it looks like. Yeah  if you have some financial information that that'd be nice  so. Hmm. No  it wasn't wasn't allo it was possible  not allowed  so. So that's um why I'm not sure that you're allowed to share documents on the on the draft. I don't care. I haven't heard any complaints yet  so. Um Yeah  the oh  they inc uh they include the new one. Or just for you. Oh no  I didn't have that. All it tells just let's make make a new tick the new one. Um other side. Yeah  let's increase it a little because Yeah  draw us up some some designs of of possible just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big  so the more less important More or less. Just play a little with this  put l shift a little up or down and we'll see what looks best. Or just po post your designs from time to time on the product share. Yeah  so we don't want we want very little buttons  just the buttons you use a lot. Well what we had function that what people do  so. People change channels  people they change the volume and they they change channel  they turn T_V_ off and on  for example. That's the basic fu that's what you do I'm not sure who present that again  but those are the basic function that people use it for  so those should be very well represented. That's true  but that's what we stick under the menu button. Everything is you say in every T_V_ that's configured under the menu. Yeah  but But I think most modern T_V_s have it in their menu. Uh we'll we'll see what we can come up with. Under forty. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Yeah yeah. The want to pay for Oh. Uh shall we? Younger  age sixteen and forty five. That's all here  here it says Yeah  age sixteen forty fi interest in main features more critical. Okay  so we're not focusing on this. Um All the interest in features  not really the L_C_ oh here. Would you pay for uh speech recognition in a remote control. Hmm  okay? Speech recognition is quite Yeah  just look at the possibilities then  because if apparently it's what people want  it's supposed to be a luxurious remote  maybe it's not even that expensive. Or find a compromise  maybe just a black and white or for some extra information on it  on your programmes. Me too. I mean we all do. Right. I think it's something we should put into consideration. Apparently it's what people want  so. We should see if what it costs  if it's possible. Yeah. Yeah  we should do a little thing about design  because it looks boring really to me. Even if you put it even if you put a different cover on it  it looks still looks boring  so. I have no clue. I just drew something what which would fit into your hand easily. I think it's a very Sorry? Yeah? Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah  but you have to j just keep in mind it shouldn't be too heavy. I mean we can stick it in in there  I think. Huh even if in the worst case we can even Could you give me the pen back? So let's say that people would want an L_C_D_ thing. Let's take take the basic design again  what we oh  crap uh came up with. I'll just make it a little bigger now. So a transmitter here. Anyway. We could let's say we have an L_C_D_ screen  people want an L_C_D_ screen. So then we should probably put it here. It doesn't have to be really big  but just just have to be has to be there. Think it's a good place  people don't No? It's not that uh it's not the most important function  it's just an extra thing  it just you press the buttons on top  because your finger is on top. How can you use an L_C_D_ screen? Yeah  but why I I'm not sure. Uh if you t if you press a button  you can see it  ri I'm not sure wha I'm trying to imagine myself what it would look like. You would prefer it n Okay. So we have three people saying it should be on top. Okay  but then you would would s have to stack away your buttons somewhere else. Anyways. Uh this looks a little About the L_C_D_s thing. Well if it if it's if it's possible wi if it's not too expensive  we should include it  because it's it's cool. Uh we have green now uh Or maybe we should m we could uh draw draw something a bit that has it on on on the bottom. Maybe in a circle for example  like we like in this example. I think this is not good  but for we could make circular buttons for example. For up and down  ma make it a circle on it  because it I think the channel button should be in the centre. Channel button should be st stick together  for example here in this section. Because it's uh We're not sure about the size anyway  just a general design. You can make it as big as you want. For example if you take uh No  let's see. For example just Yeah. I don't think if we if we even use an L_C_D_ screen  we need to  definitely. Yeah  but we have to see what the si what the size is. The L_C_D_ doesn't have to nee doesn't need to be very big. Mm let's see. Finish meeting now. Okay  we will. So either We either we have to decide what what people want. Either this one  this this could be the luxurious one. So we have channel buttons here. I'm just drawing something uh. Uh I think this would this would look cool. You could have it for example small buttons here for some extra functions  so if your basic function's here  we should like we decided before  programmes up and down  and volume here. Well you can just no  I'm not sure if we can do that  but we could put a microphone in here for example. Just to do research into both  w what it costs and what it takes for space. But let's cut the meeting for now yes. Yeah  let's think of a name  okay. Uh okay. Okay  at anyways  the the minutes will be on the on the web shortly  so there we go uh. Yeah  to all. ,The UI and ID presented a prototype drawing of the remote control design. The rubber case is yellow with black buttons and dark yellow for the menus. There are buttons for teletext  favourite channel  mute and OK. It incorporates both LCD screen and speech recognition. The prototype proved over budget (17 euros). The main contributing factors were the LCD and speech recognition. The latter was taken out  along with the special colour. Everyone agreed that the financial information should not have been given to them at the last moment. After the costing  the original prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad). The criteria used were look and feel (1)  whether it is easy to find (1)  whether it is easy to learn (2)  use of LCD (3)  speech recognition (7)  trendiness (2). Finally  the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (satisfactory)  leadership and teamwork (happy with it  but they missed communicating in between meetings)  and means (SMARTboard could be improved in terms of response time  the digital pens could not be used on more than one page at the same time). Finally  the decided to call their design Triple-R. 
Okay. Okay. Next.. What do you mean there? Okay. You can disconnect it there no? Then you can connect this one or this one yeah. All to your computer. Oh yeah. Okay. Hmm. Yeah. Well it would be f No you can't. Oh. Well  it depends you know like there is uh it's a very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on  off  one  two  twenty three  yeah. It's it's going to be li it's not going to be s so easy but u usually it's going to be more of an isolated case but it's but I don't know with twenty fi Okay it's uh decline. Okay. Okay. Now you can move I think yeah. It's a channel selection  a module  this and this function  go to the. Yeah. But is it uh can you just buy it on the market and f plug it in or you want to ma Well it to du it's just you had to change the frequencies. Yeah. But you should be careful  people are sometime becoming problem  like a guy has recently designed a remote uh uh uh which could switch off any other T_V_s  so basically through all the things. So maybe we should think of yeah. Yeah so you can just go on the street and then switch off everyone's T_V_ and you can just walk away You don't have to be near the T_V_ at all. Yeah so. Okay. So I can take I think mine now there. Okay so voila. Hmm I can take mine it's okay  voila  mm so mm. Okay. It's on the desktop. Technical function. Okay. Like so. Well. So um I'm going to talk a little bit about the technical function so wha what actually it's about what is the user going to do  I think my last presented what is going inside  so what's the user is going to see from the outside and how he is going to use it. So well the approach is that uh basically the idea is to send a message to the T_V_ set  as Mael has pointed  and it will be decoded by the T_V_ and usually we it is easier to have uh keys or buttons with which people can uh press and then um changing a button will basically uh change the message which is being sent to the T_V_ and uh um a and basically it sends an internal signal and decoded by the receiver. So p as um Anna has said that this ki people are interested in things which are you don't need to k press the keys  people are can have a speech recognition but this is uh s a question which will we have to see later. But in the present scenario is that you have certain keys and you press it like your mobile phone  and it sends a message to the T_V_. And um so generally mm I don't have some figures sorry but um so there are two kinds of uh remote if you popularly in the household  actually so you have a standard T_V_ remote where you have just a on  off button and play  uh volume change and uh keys for the number and more than one digit option. And if you see for example righ right now uh uh even the one uh on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine  but tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows  but uh uh. Then there is uh this is the standard one with without any fancy thing you know like i it doesn't have teletext option  it can without any  it's a very simple thing  um which which you can vouch. And then you have uh what's the v video remote file which is like usually it has almost all the keys over there and  but it then it has other options like stop uh and then you play the movie or uh or fo fast forward the movie or something like that so i it has those so these are the standard uh commonly found remote controls in the uh market. And then whi which is generally used by the people. And then well personal preferences I would uh basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing where the we could have both the uh the f a T_V_ and the remote video remote control because uh some of the keys in the video's remote control and the T_V_ they could be integrated together so that uh we could um aim for the like in the f coming future um that type of uh applications with Yeah. Yeah. Um actually um you could you could think of um having s a y you can have a key which could tell y it could go to the video thing but um uh yo you you you still can't um in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the V_C_R_ option and you could play it or You can also think about having like um I in a few days you will be ha in in few ye coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate uh sitting setup box and uh you have uh um something like uh uh you do you do you suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you and uh you can just you know uh when you come back you could just switch on that thing and uh watch a program. In that case you want to browse faster  browse slow  you want to have those kind of functionalities. It's the next generation thing  but it is going to come in couple of years. It's goi Yeah it's Yeah. Yeah. So it's going to record your things and you and you you need basically the functionalities what you need in both uh uh video as well as in the standard T_V_ thing. No no we are not making a universal remote  we are just looking at uh giving a scenario  I have a T_V_ and tomorrow I am going to have set up box which is going to sit there and uh it's going to do that job for me. Yeah. So Okay so that p ends my presentation. Well. So we can always discuss about it for example uh the presently the video market actually uh this demand  video over-demand or what we call it as  it's presently booming up actually so it i like people are providing like uh things like uh uh movies  you can select actually so you want to watch a movie and uh your p your provider gives a list of movies  and then you select those list. And it basically you go off  it downloads the movie  it gives for you and then when you come you want to loo watch it on your T_V_. And thi this is going to come. Yeah it can be streamed online for you and you can say what time I want to watch the movie and Yeah so. Yeah. Yeah. Um. Yeah it's uh well you you can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys  you know right now if you take it you have like zero  one  two  three like a keys separately  but suppose if you take the the present trend of mobile phones there are like big thick keys you press on the top  it takes one number  you press on the bottom it takes another number  and uh basically uh uh so the space covered so that you don't see two separate keys there actually so it it is like uh um i i it is like uh Yeah so. So for example uh Well uh Okay  it works. Fine. So  for example you have uh presently uh keys like one  two  three like this  actually  and uh uh four five six like that and uh you can have keys like this in form like uh keys like that Forty minutes? Yeah so you you you can have uh keys like uh which are which are like so. too sorry  so we basically don't change the uh original order of them but then the keys are more spacious  they don't look uh so there there is a very sligh thing  so if you press on the top it takes the one  it takes the three  uh four  sorry four here uh five and six  so the keys can be it looks you know not very much cluttered but it looks nice for you don't have too many keys but you can have a lot of options t if you press on the to Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well Well I it's fine with me like the price as long as it is uh not too expensive. Uh and it d uh Our provin Mm. Uh yeah  that's that's what we needed basically. Uh that's needed right now. And uh basically you can look to the standards of other Actu Yeah. Yeah you can also browse through all the standards you know  where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them. Okay. Okay. Voila. Hmm. So. Well. Oh I don't have anything right now. We can we'll we'll go and we'll I'm sure we'll up something good for the Yeah so we meet in well what are our Okay. Cool. So see you later. Yep. Perfect. So y you are the secretary also. Right? Okay. Perfectly yeah yeah of course uh-huh. You mean the social target group who we wants to target? Oh the customers  okay. It's it's easy to learn or how do you say it's Okay too much time to learn. Okay. Not enough Maybe y y you cannot put this webpage online on the Ah it's it okay it's a webpage on the C_ it's a file okay. O otherwise you yeah. You can connect this one. Yeah. So these are important numbers that Matthew and I need to take into account for our functional um Yeah Yeah these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account for the uh both yeah user interface and functional design. Because if there are many numbers and we need to select to to constraint uh our design based on what is more important. Speech recognition in Ah okay. So that we don't Do we not need any button on the remote control it would be all based on speech. Okay. Interesting idea. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And we don't know where the state of the art of speech recognition is  maybe you know? But it's quite noisy if there is the T_V_ uh shouting. Okay. So you had to to to summarise maybe the Mm. Mm-hmm. I thi You us yeah yeah. Okay perfect. ... Mm 'kay. Yeah. Mm I okay I stay I can move as far as Maybe I take your chair? I okay. So I think as everybody knows uh I'm the uh Industrial Designer. And uh in this presentation uh this group presentation um is gonna focus on the working design of the the remote control. Um I'd like first to give a quick a very simple introduction  how does it work  so that everybody knows even if you don't have a very uh technical background uh what is it because I think in the product it is important. So basically um the basic function of a remote control is to send uh messages to another system that is fixed. And so an energy source feeds an integrated circuit  the chip  that can compose messages  usually uh through a um infrared bit and uh the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the the messages  alright. So my method for um designing the yeah the work design uh yeah first the the main point is that I would wish to to make a really functional product. I would prefer to have very functional um capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesn't work. So for that yeah as it's important to take into account the user requirements from the Marketing uh Expert uh Anna and um w to to we should agree on what are the technical functions uh for this remote control and I show you the the working design. So um basically uh here is a really large view of what we want. Uh we want an on off button  it can be uh it's simple but it's it's important  and also uh the to both channels as well as other buttons that come after  right. So the components I quickly draw here  is that in this part you have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver so that's my method is um will be to well my aim would be to uh design the and choose the chips and the infrared um components to build the remote control right. So of course we need energy sources and uh uh the receiver a a receiver. This is very quick uh design  uh you stop me or interrupt me if uh you don't agree on it on that. And um so what I have found and after a lot of work actually I I draw this I draw for you this uh schema that can be maybe too technical for you but is very important for me you know. And uh that's it so I won't go into details about that but uh these are my preferences to use uh that kind of components. So. So the the main components you see here are the cheapest I have found and yeah th you have always a compromise with uh reliability and uh i if it's expensive  but uh this one was not this one also really uh reliable um so yeah that's it for the working design  uh I hope you get clearer view on uh what what a remote control is uh in terms of uh technical components but maybe yeah No no no no we we will uh This is a preference but we can always change uh Yeah. Of course yeah. Yeah. We will use uh infrared protocol uh using yeah infrared and uh and of course we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists and but we what we can do is uh uh adapting the the chips inside uh to the best uh chips and uh infrared bubbles. Um. Okay. The frequencies? Yeah yeah. Of course yeah in the chip you have it yeah. That can control o other things. Yeah. Of course yeah we should take that into account in the uh Yes. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yep. These are kind of next generation functionalities. Mm 'kay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Or even you don't need to download it  it's streamed uh online uh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Fourteen or for O okay. So Mm-hmm. Yeah. Because they are already used to that  you know  product. Yeah. Mm-hmm. ... Yes. Mm-hmm. Yep. Yeah we have yeah twelve point five Euros uh per uh per R_ s R_C_ and I think uh with this now you know that chips are very uh cheaps and uh we can include it in our control some new new features. Yeah. And um But yeah that's Ye I don't think L_C_D_ is not necessary well  th for long term. Yeah. Universal. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah because we have to take into account that we are gonna b we are gonna sell uh four aro around four million so when we speak about these numbers uh the price of a chip is uh price of a chip is very cheap. So I'm okay for designing um a ne uh less yeah a a kind of universal uh R_C_ yeah. Yeah. Yeah that's needed  yeah. And if we want to get the market  we really need that. Yes. Exactly. Is that okay for you? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Oh that's that's fine then. Yeah. Okay perfect. So I see all everybody's here  'kay. And we can start meeting. The I will uh present here agenda with with with with slides to you. Um as you can see here. So first uh just to mention I will take notes uh of this meeting and uh I will try to work them out and give them to you. I've also made notes of the previous meeting and um I was about to send them you but then uh I had to go to this uh meeting so you will get them too uh Um. Yes. Indeed. Um. Then I hope you all have uh worked out some some uh some some presentations about uh about well you the the task given to you in the previous meeting. Um. W We will uh in a minute we will uh start with them. Um  we will see in which order we will handle them of. Um then I will uh bring in some some some new requirements I I got uh from the uh account manager  I try to work them out  they were quite abstract  and we can have maybe have com some discussion about it. Uh Um about the functions and Well in this meeting we should really try to reach a decision about the target group and the functionality of the Yes I mean well yes w who are we going to uh to well to sell this  the customers  indeed yes. Think that's that's important matter. Uh. So And then uh we will close this meeting uh and after this meeting we'll uh we'll have a lunch. Good. Um. Maybe um why uh Anna can you c do you have a presentations? You don't have presentation? Uh you want a table to to uh Yes yes maybe maybe you can uh can just talk about it or maybe you can use the whiteboard if necessary um. Mm-hmm. Mm. Do you Do you have this uh information on the web page you said? Yes  mayb maybe you can can send an email to me later uh. Uh about this. Mm. Mm. Yes yes  I have that too. Mm. Mm. They think that or do their doctor the doctor says? But it's it's the opinion of the uh of the users huh? So mm. You can maybe just just Hmm. Mm-hmm. D do you have numbers o o on that? Well it would it would be a solution for uh when your remote control is lost  I mean when it has speech recognition then uh i then it doesn't matter where it is  my well it's we should be in range  or maybe it can respond and produce sound  so say where it is. But the these are all quite fancy features I'm not sure whether we will we can make this for for twelve Euro fi and fifty cents. Mm. Yes  that that that that's mm. Do you have some more important facts or can we go to the next presentation? Mm. Mm-hmm. Decline with age  mm. Mm. Yes. We will talk about it later. Okay. Mm. Okay. um Uh maybe uh Mael c c can you give uh uh your presentation uh? Oh  this is Mm-hmm  y y you can move  uh. Yes. You can you can sa take my chair. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Is huh overwhelming. No. And and why do you want these kind of component? I mean  are they cheap  or are they uh reliable? What were your Mm. Yes. It it it's more clear now I think. So Mm-hmm. What I w what I was thinking about uh the the the schema uh about uh the sender and the receiver  I mean can you can you get back to it? Yeah uh  the receiver is of course already in the television and we are not uh able to change it. So we we must adapt to the to the receiver. I I suppose there is a standard uh way of communicating to televisions uh. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yes. Okay. Thank you. Mm. Yeah yes I I I I I feel I I I think M Mael will will consider this uh th these things. Maybe Maybe we can go to to your presentation uh Matthew. I I I assume you were finished here. Uh okay. Oh. I Uh  sorry? I know where it is. It's uh Yes. It's uh Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm mm mm mm mm. Mm yes  but I think it's i i it's already there  I mean the hard disk uh recorders uh I I've seen them in the shop. W w w w we need to decide on on on on in how far we go to in this. Mean  you can go pretty far I f I think with with with functions and possible uh future p uh prospects yes. But it's good to keep in mind. Mm. Very well. Good. Um  so u um I have uh received some some some some well points of of thinking over of my account manager and uh I would like to share them with you. Um first thing is uh teletext is a well known feature of televisions but it's it's getting used less and less. That's that's especially because of the internet of course. So we should think about it um. Do we include it  and do we give it a prominent uh prominent uh place on on on the on well huh on the remote mot control itself. Uh as uh a in any case it's it's not used  well very much  but it's it is still used. Um further yes we must think  uh do we stay uh to to television only  the television as we as we all know it with with broadcasting signals and you can't go back uh huh  or do we uh uh go further as Matthew indicated by supporting uh uh recording uh devices? Uh indeed indeed. And and and the hard disk recorders. Um  furthermore  uh  w we need really need to interest uh y younger customers and then with younger customers I mean people uh below the age of forty  and our our current customers are mainly forty plus uh which well Forty. So that's to that's I mean there's a market but uh they will grow older older and you'll al always need to have the the future with younger people. Um therefore  younger people like trendy trendy designs  so that's w we should make our our our R_C_ as trendy as possible but it should also be uh have a reliable image  so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all. Hmm. Ma Maybe Maybe you can draw it on the on the board uh Hmm. Yes yes mo Yes it's recognisable Mm mm. And and they are skilled uh by using it. Mael can you hand me over this uh? Uh thank you. Mm well I think fi five min Mm-hmm. Okay. 'Kay I I think now that the idea's clear. Uh we should now uh try to decide um on our target group. Of course they have already one. So our our our remote control has to be better. Mm-hmm. Mm. I well I think many people said uh in your in in your research uh uh uh the appearance of the uh R_C_ is is important when they are buying one but Indeed. So that will be about functionality Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. So your you think we should go for a more u universal high-performance What do What do you think about What componen I don't know. I don't know whether that's necessary. Is the L_C_D_ screen I think thi this could be this could be a market because uh universal remote controls uh tend to be uh quite expensive. S so we can try to go in between  and offer a product which is not as expensive and not as complicated but but still but still people have the idea this is more functional than a normal uh uh R_C_ because it has more uh it it is in some kind universal. Mm yes but w we're targeting I think on more on the on the twenty to forty group. People yes. Who just have or already have a job and have the money but may not want to spend that much money on a on a universal universal control. Uh well I think uh when we think it over I thi I think we are trying to offer the a kind of universal control for for less money. So d Do you agree? Mm-hmm. You think it's possible for the twelve Euro fifty? Okay. Um so then we we decide on on on going to this more universal kind of control. Mm. Mm. Okay. Yes. Mm mm mm mm. So given we are going for this uh uh universal type uh m maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need and y you will try to get more specific uh user interface content and uh maybe you can look on on what trends are in this uh in this type of market. So anyone uh has a point to bring in or shall we no. Okay. W yes  we uh we can have lunch now. So um Then th th the next meeting will uh after lunch you have uh we have uh thirty minutes of work and then we have the next meeting. But you will be informed via the computer. Okay. Mm-hmm. What's the agenda for this meeting? Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Yeah. That's the big question yeah. No  I don't. I wasn't. No. I c I can talk about it but I have no slides or anything. Mm-hmm. Well I've just been um presented with some research we've done in a small focus group so  a hundred people  just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control. Um. It's probably can't email this to you  I've just got a web page with some data on it. Um basically it's saying that users generally dislike the look and feel of their remote controls. Um seventy five u seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly. Um. Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy. Um. Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user. Uh seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot  so they use their remote control quite frequently while they're watching television. Uh. Fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons  so they've got a remote control with a lot of functionality but really most of the time they only use a small part of that. Um. I have an a web page yes. Yep. Yep  sure. Mm-hmm. So basically um there's a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control. Um  power and volume selection are only used a few times within this uh per hour. Um  channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times um and then there's things like channel settings  audio settings  which are only used very infrequently. Um. Teletext is used um fourteen times in the hour  so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used. Um. An interesting thing that this report has brought up is that um fifty fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room  so some way of some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users. Um. Thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control  they want something that's easier to use straight away  more intuitive perhaps. Um. Thirty four percent said it took too much time to learn to use a new one. Yep. Um. And thirty twenty six percent said remote controls are bad for R_S_I_. I don't know how we'd go about combating that. For R_S_I_? Respet Repetitive strain injury. So. But Mm. Yeah. That's what the report says yeah. Um and then it's got a demographic breakdown on Uh I should be able to actually  if I email it to you now. Oh no  yeah. Yeah. Um  s hang on. Well. Oh I need to muck around with this. It's probably easier if you put it on yours and then I'll just email it to you. It's just a web link. One thing it goes on to talk about  which is interesting  is the hang on a minute. Mm-hmm. Yep. Um  one thing is interesting is talking about um speech recognition in a remote control. And who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful. Yes  I'll just get this up. Well potentially yeah  um I think even for interesti yeah I think that would not work so well. You wanna have both options. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Um Well This is now talking about um who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control  who would pay more for it  um. Ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more  it goes down from there  seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five  thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five  um twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five. Yeah. But we sh Yeah  it really depends where we're gonna be targeting this product  um  which we'll be talking about later I think. Did you get the email? Yep  that one. Just follow that link. It'll be in a different window  yep. That's left that one. Yep. Mm. So that's the figure that I was just talking about there  with the different demographics. Another thing it's talking about there is the L_C_D_ screen but there's no figures apparently on that. Sorry? Oh. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Well. You drew it a long time ago? Ninety one. Ah. That's handy. So if the b T_V_ in the next apartment's really loud  you can just turn it off. Yeah. I like that idea. Mm-hmm. Yep. Mm-hmm. Okay. How would that work? So you've got say maybe a V_C_R_ and a T_V_ which are separate  so you on my one at home I've got a V_C_R_ remote which then changes the channel on the V_C_R_ and doesn't do anything on the T_V_  so is it gonna be like a switch on the remote that says t use the T_V_ or use the V_C_R_? or does it know which one you want to use? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. That's fair enough. Mm. But I don't think we're trying to make a universal remote here. That's  yeah. Mm. Mm. Because y Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Yep. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Mm. Mm. So D_V_D_s and V_C_R_s? Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Mm. But I think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting  especially if we're going after a younger market  that's the the the mm the new and the funky things  that's  yeah  there's lot there's lots of pretty mobile phones  not too many pretty remote controls. That's Mm. Mm-hmm. Okay. How much longer have we got for the meeting by the way? 'Cause we haven't talked about demographic at all and it's a very important issue. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Which I think is quite tricky. Um  basically we're trying to get people to buy a remote control wouldn't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one? But it's not going to have more functionality  'cause it's only a low market  it's a cheap-end remote control  we can't beat modern functionality  we might we'll be able to beat them on th the look of it  th the design of it but that's not a big seller  if they're not just going to buy a new remote control just 'cause it looks pretty  they have to actually need it as well. So I'm not sure how we can get people to buy this thing. Mm. Yeah. But why are they buying one in the first place? Mm. But if people are buying a new remote control for functionality they'll buy a universal remote. I've got friends who've got so many things they need a universal remote  otherwise they're using five different remotes for their all their things. In that case they wouldn't buy our product  because it doesn't give them what they need in terms of functionality. Well  we can't  with the price range. We We're not building a universal remote  we're not building a high end product. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. But yeah. If we're getting into universal remote territory  we're getting to L_C_D_ screens and things like that which would drive the cost up a lot. For universal remotes If you mm. And quite complicated to use  yes. Mm-hmm. Not as flexible maybe  yeah  but s yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. But if we're going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own T_V_s to use a remote control on. Okay. So they're yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yep. I don't know really what the the price range for remote controls is. Are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range  or are we kind of middle to bottom? I don't know. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. So I guess what I'd like from a universal remote is maybe choosing between three devices  being able to switch between them  there may be stereo  V_C_R_ and T_V_. And just be able to s use them all from the same remote  but not at the same time. Mm. Mm-hmm yep. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. ,The project manager opened the meeting and stated the agenda to the team members. The marketing expert discussed the findings of a survey which indicated that current remotes are ugly  difficult to use  have a number of unused buttons  frustrate users when misplaced  and contribute to RSI. The marketing expert also stated that young users like speech recognition and that users in general want buttons for power  channel selection  volume control  and a few lesser used settings. The user interface designer presented existing remotes to exemplify the need for simpler designs  discussed the use of components such as titanium and a back-lit LCD screen  and discussed other features to consider such as color options. The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and how to handle universal capability and speech recognition. After the project manager's closing  the project manager recapped some decisions and the team discussed how to handle the issue of locating a remote when misplaced. 
So is Why not save that. Do you want to replace existing file  no. I actually tried to transfer it to My Documents  but spreadsheet. Yeah  but I've ta uh right  I'll just re-do it. That's the easiest way. Right. R right. Um  all these things have cost implications. And so when I done my thing on cost a I had assumed that the only uh button that would be a different colour would be the uh the red apple button. So However  I've now. But um  yeah so uh but there would be a cost implication on that  and uh as I suppose that so whether wanted to put in all these colours  would be uh open to debate  I suppose. An important consideration. Right  okay so um And the second one underneath would be the idea for the Right  okay. So we've got um detail design meeting. Right. So So  we've got prototype presentation  which we've just done  evaluation criteria  um and finance  so I guess w we have to evaluate if that meets the various uh aspects that we're looking for uh from um our previous meeting. So other than the fact that it doesn't have the second layer  but um obviously obviously it would. But other than that  we got the red apple. We got the buttons and the only thing that has really changed is the is the colouration of the buttons  and the bit after the evaluation criteria is uh is the finance. And the and the cost implication. The only snag about this is that uh the cost is probably kind of important. So um  and then the production evaluation  as to how easy that would be to uh to manufacture. Um  and whether it would uh Right  so uh as far as the the finance of it would be concern would be to make sure that the cost aye the production cost 'cause you may remember that was one of the first uh considerations was to be in d under um uh twelve fifty or two and a half uh twelve and a half Euros. So  there's no redesign. So that should uh Right  so  seems to me that the thing that I have to do is is quickly find that uh Right. Okay. Right.. Okay  so  by the fact that we've got uh the simple chip and the uh kinetic energy source  we've got a single curved case. We've got a rubber uh case materials supplements. So  we had decided that we're having rubber buttons and Okay. W the button supplements. Well  originally  I thought there would just be uh one in there because it was the one red apple. But So the so the real w the real question then would come in. Do you make all the buttons O Well  so we've got one special button form  which was the apple. Everything else is gonna be a standard. We've got special material  rubber  wood  titanium  et cetera and that  so  I was originally  I was thinking rubber wasn't special  but according to this  maybe it is. So And the r I mean effectively we've got sixteen buttons that we're gonna have on there. W I don't know is is is the sort of answer  is that meant to be all sixteen buttons  and therefore I mean  what's the op The option was maybe not to have rubber buttons  but just to have the one that was soft and spongy  and therefore Whereas it would be the special colour would be for the So you would only have the one special button that was rubber  whereas the rest would be hard plastic. Mm. I would Every design change is uh I dunno  um Okay  um  if we just had all the buttons as standard  except for the one red apple  then that would take care of that  I guess. We'd have one special colour and one special button form. And when I plugged that in last time remember it has to be under twelve and a half. As far as I know  that um that took care of the uh of the various supplements. And if What happened? Now  right. Okay  so  but the point would be that if we uh if we just did special Sorry  you were saying that it would be that one  that you would put in one there. Okay. So it Well  is it s is no  it's nine point seven I've got. Okay. So  that would that would work out fine if uh uh as assuming your correction are are assuming that that one change covers all the buttons  then that would be fine. And there's nothing else as far as I can see that we we had uh planned to put on. Uh-huh. Well  hold on. Um  if we Okay  that gives us twelve point seven But remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the Oh  I see  so just take out the special colour for the apple and And go for battery instead. That would give you one less. But you reckon that i I mean the thing is that you wanted to a appeal to people and not have to replace batteries. Mm-hmm. But which do you think or which do we think is the more important of the options? In a sense  at the moment  we've got a total which we need to reduce down by one point two. At least. Remember that was a minimum requirement. The other option if we're planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful  would be to um make it originally  we're gonna make it a simple product. Mm-hmm. Makes sense.. Sorry  do you want that back up? Right. Okay  but remember the main the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost. Go for one. Yep. Okay. Yeah  why not not  m m maybe nearer three. Two three. Well  it's just that uh saying something remember that when you look down  we've got solar power  we've got uh various other things you could have  and we're not going for these options. Mm-hmm. Okay. No. 'Cause you can't afford that w we took that out too. Didn't you? Or Well  wait a minute. In thirteen point seven we do have kinetic. The problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five. And one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic. So  it's very much dependant on what you do with your options. And if you're definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker  then because that the other functions we've got in are are more at the The special material  the rubber  wood  titanium  et cetera  if you go for that  th that's at the high end 'cause that's point six  whereas down at uh just special colours uh is point two. Now you're trying to lose one point two  so it seems to me that if you're going for the sample sensors speaker  you're basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else. And and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery  to have your uh sample sensor speaker  and then you're looking to uh take out uh point two  which would be come from the button supplements category. Um  interface type um  well plastic rather than rubber. That that that would make the significant difference. You could either you could have it If you have a in plastic rather than rubber  then that would uh enable you to get you could keep kinetic then  you could keep your sample sensor  and you'd be looking to take out point two. So you could uh fiddle that down your special form at the bottom  or your special colour at the bottom. And that would enable you to to do it. Yeah. Ye Well  okay  but It's rubber as it is  yes. We got we've we've got thirteen point seven and we've got it in at the moment and if and basically  we're going to reduce down from that. But the current one  you'd say would be fancy  would be too Mm-hmm. I would've said about a two as well. Oh. The next on Well  I can just sing about. Easy to use. I would've said yes. I would go for a one on that at this point in time. Um  incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer. Well  yeah it certainly has some.. Yep. I don't know. Yep. Yeah  I woulda said two would seem reasonable. The product is a recognisable real r uh reaction product? Oh. S Okay. So we're going for a two  three? Sure. Right  okay. Two. Right  come on. That's that decided. Right. So So we're now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements  and then About a two. Two. Yep. Two b two b two  yeah. Yes. Well  you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements. Okay  well I put it back on. Yes  I would've thought so. Okay  so what was it  control uh F_ eight  wasn't it? Oh. Oh. How kind. Right  okay. So  you can see there that the If you want to keep kinetic  right  you've got a choice there of going down to battery  which would save you one. You've got the sample sensor and and sample speaker  which is your big item. That's right. Which gets you Yes. Alright. Okay  so So we're going for plastic  yes? Yep. Well  uh w uh there was debate as to how you would count them. You got special colour. Well originally I was assuming we had the red apple  and therefore  that was the special colour. Well  we've got special form. Now that would be one button  and the question was was that all buttons or is that just one button. 'Cause our plan really was to have one button only with a special So so no matter how you look at that  that would be the same. The other thing would then be special material  rubber  wood  titanium. Alright. So  special colour  you want three in there. Okay. That makes sense. Okay. Okay. Yeah  I would agree with that  I think. So special colours  two. And we've got special form is the one apple. The rest are all standard  although you could argue that should maybe be You were making these buttons down the bottom  I was presuming  bigger than the other ones  or were you? Was that the idea? Uh-huh. I would have thought that's probably about r well. Right. Yep  that makes sense. Yep. I woulda said so. Yeah. So you'd maybe put fash fan uh fashion at three rather than two. Real Reaction produ I'm not quite sure  what does that mean? Yep I would s You mean of Well you could argue you might do it once a year  you would change  because at the moment you're making a red apple. So next year you could make next year's model the same  but have it as a a yeah whate whatever  a lemon. Yeah  l a lemon lemon or something. And that amount Yeah  we've the main thing we've changed really is the casing isn't it? We've Well  ease has certainly stayed. Yeah. And the speech feature. How it would play out  yeah. Oh. Well  but you've got the company logo on there  which would effectively be a stick-on badge. So you're in a sense  you're comparing the product without the company logo. And then y but you've got the space for it to stick it on. Don't think so. But but i but in the sense that  as you saw with um the Windows logo badge  it doesn't really matter. There's virtually n The way that you frame  you know  the Windows badge on there  it really doesn't matter what colour it is  so long as our company's logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline. Fact  they've got black and white or black and silver. So basically  even if you had a silver the same colour of silver on your display  because you've got effectively a double edging on the uh on the logo  it means that it splits off what your logo is from the from the product. And that's actually quite a sneaky way of doing it. You could put in another Well  in this one  you've actually got three colours of buttons. Well  we decided that the blue ones were the um the standard colour. So you were talking about uh um We're assuming that all the buttons on the second panel  the hidden away panel  would all be standard. Which m may or may not be the case. Well  yeah. Bu but but uh was the was there not a button that you were thinking of on the um on the other opt you know  on the second page  as it were  that uh you were thinking of maybe having as a different colour? Yeah  well Alright. Okay. So we just add that to profitability in effect. Right  so we're meant to finish up in five minutes. Mm-hmm. So we're okay this way around. Until the design team comes in and says  get off. But you are the design team. So what bit are we on to? Yeah. I th I th Oh. Right  okay. Oh drats  I've botched that  haven't I. Right  okay um What's happened here? Right  okay um Mm. Right  okay um  Right. So we got So we've done the the finance bit and the Excel project and the We've done the redesign. So we're now on to project process. Now satisfaction with  for example  room for creativity  leadership  teamwork  means  et cetera  whiteboard  digital pens  et cetera. So  we're actually now uh  in a sense  on to the evaluation of the course rather than the evaluation of the project is m my understanding of it. So what did you and remembering that nobody's just over the curtain. So  um So I suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down  which I will do. So  uh I think I have to finish that page. Right  okay  so Project evaluation. So  um Creativity. Did you feel you got a chance to express yourselves well enough? Well um Individual meetings. How do you mean? In you on your own. Um Mm  The only thing you find is in a manufacturing process  you would normally  you go to a meeting  you decide  right  you do this  you do that  you do that. Then you go away. You find out information. You then come back. You then discuss it. You then go and change things around  and then go back. So Whereas  this time  you're really getting it from a database source  so it's not uh well uh Anyway  so  what do you want to put down? I've put  seemed okay. Creativity  seemed okay. Um um flow of information on on any given subject given subject um sometimes disjointed. Um Have could have used a different example pel to increase create Creativity. You have to do it within a set time frame is the other thing  so I th I uh d But the other thing is that uh they're I'm guessing that they're trying to use this um software to to demonstrate how you could uh do a project. I mean  m my wife at the moment  for instance  is uh acting as a computer um for um you normally  you got a problem  so you go to your tutor and find out information to see how to get it fixed. So what she's doing is she's having to spend a day at the computer terminal at one end so that any student that comes along can uh ask whatever question. And then you or the idea is that the whichever uh person's at the other end can point them in the right direction  show them where to either give them directly give them help  or secondly  point them in the right direction  either at the library  or uh or or come back  or go and see Joe Bloggs  or whatever. So uh  and that was a project I suspect similar to this  because they they were actually trying to debug the uh computer software to enable um to enable it to work. And of course  you had the machine crashing and various things going wrong. So Alright  so we've got uh New ideas found  did we find any  no. Alright. Leadership  teamwork. Does You've got voice recognition computers  that's not remote controls. Mm-hmm. Okay  so how do you reckon teamwork went? To uh go uh reasonably well. Okay. Bit bit arbitrary. Mm-hmm. So  we're m we're meant to comment on leadership and the means  E_ G_ whiteboard  digital pens  et cetera. And and new i new ideas found was the the other thing. Now  I'd much rather be in marketing but I certainly didn't get this uh computer to work as well as I would have liked. However  um Alright uh means  so whiteboard um so really  it's uh equipment. Oh. Right. New ideas found  so one or two. um and uh voice uh  was it voice activated um recognition. Right  so  uh are the costs within budget  yes. Is the project evaluated  yes. Uh  don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary. Then celebration. Yeah. Uh  so we don't re So really I tried to save this the last time at twelve point three  and it didn't seem to have saved anywhere. Mind you  the the figure last was was different  but it should be poss We also have a apple slash cherry design at the top. Yeah  yeah  we might get a For the M_. They're thinking For the first time  well it was hard to get the h um the actual labelling on the individual buttons. Hum  you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons  so you've got the volume in orange on design there  and the the channel is in blue. Yeah  sis Yes  we'll have the slide-away. Bottom. Mm-hmm. Yes  yes. Okay. Mm-hmm. This this is a yes  this is our presentation of the prototype. Mm-hmm. Could we get this on the board just so we can see or do you mean do you have the figures there? 'Kay  Alice. So  sh 'Kay this should be then. Mm-hmm. Have a push button interface. Um Um Yeah. And then we'd have So that's nine point one there so we've got some 'Kay. Just give us a bit of I switching around those th um on the electronics we got the sample sensor. At the moment we've just got the simple chip  which costs one. Um  I guess the sample sens sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing  which puts up to four? We should be slightly over our budget but if we gather something else down to slightly lower standard  and maybe go with the one the special form buttons  then we could have the speech So uh maybe if we got rid of like the maybe one of the special colours  kept them all the same colour  then we could have the voice recognition without Yeah  yeah. Um Oh possibly  yeah  yeah maybe. Maybe um we'd be giving up on the kinetic. Um We should Yeah  that would save us one  though we'd still be slightly ov Yeah  yeah. Well  since it's the through the whole technology type thing  um  you were saying in the market research that people like kind of interesting gadgets in them. Um  whether they would figure the the s uh sample senor and the sample speaker  voice recognition be sort of a worthwhile thing to have. And then still have the batteries  or whatever they would prefer not uh You know what I mean? The the problem was the battery's running out and losing the um losing the remote. So you gotta decide which of those is more important to them. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay  well we have a single curve  which was maybe like the feel of the product's quite good. So uh Um  then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel  which was in at the time. Um  sorry that'd be considered fancy. So maybe maybe a two. Yeah. Um  deciding between the kinetic power or um the speech recognition  and if we had either of those for our budget  they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition. Um But not the kinetic. Like the power. No  we c ca yeah  we can't afford both. No may is maybe about neutral plus it it it's got something  but it hasn't got Right. Okay. 'Kay. Okay. Um Mm-hmm. So it says if we make a slightly more fancy  then we lose points innovation  and if we make it more innovative innovative  then we lose points on it being fancy  so Yeah  yeah. Um It does  yeah. Yeah  m um Yeah  it was just doing it quite well. Um  I think we're gonna have to lose some of these  but the moment  as it stands  it's um Uh the sensor using all of its all of its products  all of its buttons  and it's got a fairly big label on the bottom saying where it comes from. Okay. Also it's kind of spongy rubberiness is maybe bit more kinda comfortable than kinda sleek and new age. Um  it depends which way you look at it. Maybe a kind of three? Uh d Yeah  so it's So should we get So are definite Was it thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if has. Okay  so we need to So I guess this Is this the last stage once we sort out the finances part of it? Yeah  yeah we'll make the adjustments and then see how are rates are going. Oh actually we just have a plastic case  then we lose two points  which gets us um In right within the budget range. So that's eleven point seven  and then we could make sure we definitely had all the button supplements. Possibly  yeah. Um And that would allow us to have all the technical innovations. So we'd lose a little bit on the maybe kind of Oh yeah  and that would now be Yeah  that's that's within the budget. Um Do we actually have Do we just have one special uh special forms down here? Um And we we've we've got we've got enough for another we've got nought point eight left  so we've got enough for another Yeah  um But the but but but the I think maybe the special colour  we've got three now just because the volume buttons are different  I guess we'd have the ones which are blue at the moment would would just be the standard colour. Yeah  which I think we should Yeah  they'll still be fine for the for the price. Okay  uh that's probably it. Ne uh Maybe that'll be a second supplement. Then there's a spe a second special form. Um Well you got you got twelve. So I think that should still be okay. Yeah  that's twelve point three  so we're still within budget on that. Um So decide we've lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it  but generally speaking  we've kept the other attributes to the That's without Yeah. And specially it definitely could fits the the real product What was the what's the company name? R yeah. Yeah  yeah. I mean it still seems definitely fit that p so that's like if that's the new age kind of um inno innovative c type company  then um having the kinetic feature and the voice recognition is p quite high up on Um Mm-hmm. Yeah so it's a Whatever fruit was in fashion next year. That yeah  that was uh that was just about all. I think we've saved quite a bit because we've just got the push-button interface  which is by far the cheapest. Um So maybe in a sense not having that  maybe we've lost some maybe lost something on the innovation side? I dunno. And that is like the most standard type of button. Yeah. And everything else has stayed pretty much the same  so Yeah  plus if anything that is special forms makes it slightly easier to to use. Um  well we've still got the kinetic energy. Um Yeah  the speech feature. I think we've cut just about the same. We've maybe lost Hasn't it It's hard to tell how the rubber the rubber casing would really affect Um But I think more the the features of the actual control will be more important than maybe than the the actual aesthetics  but But either way  I think we've made it fairly close to what just the the company logo. So maybe there's like a set design which we get printed off. Okay. Yeah  yeah. I'm still not quite sure we've established that. Yeah. Um Yeah  maybe we've m Maybe for the the one they're gonna see all the time  we make it look good  and um  fit the kind of idea of what they want. And then for the more functional buttons  we don't worry too much about that and just have that as like a plus it's hidden away anyway  you're not gonna see it at the start. Yeah. 'Kay. Uh . That's good. Definitely lemon shaped. You had to have rubber buttons if you had the rubber case. So I think we can we're okay. Then we say it's fine  so it's all good. Just in case we need that point two for lawsuits and such like. And we seem to have least something in each criteria. We haven't completely left anything out  so As an overall product which has to be quite cheap  we've just about achieved everything. We've got the closing. We should just go through this quickly and then Um  yeah. Yeah. Yeah  I suppose and then be going out and finding more information each time and then diff things will be relevant. Is this go It kinda kis fits the purpose that it was something everyone knows about and then something we can at least look at and think how we can improve on. one of those things. Like uh  companies can have like a range of products and I don't know how it works but I guess that something got sent out and have like a brief to kind of Yeah. Well  sh we look at the last slide  see if it's got anything else. I think there's one one more to go. It was quite good with this um the white board  having that and the digital pens. Like  that's something that made it a little easier. voice recognition  especially not could Yeah. Yeah  so it's just like the same products  but just put together in a different way. Um Yeah  I guess we all had separate ideas and then discussed them. So it's not just for us  it's for the experiment as a whole  so Should we quickly look at the last slide? Sh. Is that everything? Well we've made our prototype anyway. We can have a good look at that. Mm-hmm. Y no  it's a slightly curved around the sides. Um  it's almost curved like up to the main display as well. And the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down. And the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line. And we've got the stick on the button with the company logo on. Yeah  it's a bit more fun  isn't it? And it's kinda not really at a kind of you think apple  you think computers  like Apple Mac. Yeah  and cherries are fun  summery. Ah  that's the mute. It it'd probably have to be labelled mute. But um  we didn't have anything small enough to write. Yeah. Uh  we just chose simple shapes for all them. Um  the important ones are the volume ones. So we made them a bit bigger. The mute could possibly be a bit smaller. Mm-hmm. Yeah  and we chose a V_ plus and V_ minus. Well the colours wouldn't like that's they wouldn't be too important  but we didn't have any white Play-Doh. So that's where the colour buttons came from. Uh  that's it. Maybe if you just minimise that one in the top right-hand corner of the little box. Yeah. S Um . D wouldn't you have to keep the simple chip there as well? You know how you turn that one to a zero  wouldn't the chip and the sample speaker be separate things  so you need both of them? I think the voice recognition. But I do think uh the v uh voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it's got no battery. Yeah  I'd maybe give it a a two. One's true. And a four is neutral. Yeah  'cause we haven't got the double curve  so we can't like say it's completely true. But it's pretty close. We've got almost everything we can. Yeah. Yeah  I suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit. Maybe a three. I would give it more than a four. How much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic? Because we did say that we don't wanna follow the fashion too much. If the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough. And then it stand the test of time better. Mm-hmm. Well  I suppose it's rubber as it is  isn't it. Yeah. Yeah  two or three. I'd be happy with a two. Yeah. Yeah  I would say so as well. Yeah  it's got the cherry and the sponginess. Maybe two? Yeah  that's a bit rough at the minute. Uh  well it's got the same um speech feature as the coffee machine. Yeah  two or three. Well  the logo would be more um recognisable on the actual thing. It's just that the pen wouldn't really write on that paper. But um  I think the logo would definitely be recognisable. And it does have attributes that other products do. Two? Aye. Go for it. What does what do all them numbers mean then? Do we add them up and rate or anything? we'll probably have to re-rate it. Ah it's on. Yeah  I think that'd be fine. Because that was just a trend  and we do have rubber buttons anyway. Yeah. Yeah  I think we should just imagine white buttons. Yeah. Yeah  the volume ones should stand out a bit. Real Reactions? Yeah  I don't see how we could make it any more. Um  apart from maybe doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue  like the casing. But then what colour would you make the R_s? No  I just We got the logo off the web browser. Mm-hmm. Um  I don't think they would really need to be. I think if they were just all small round blue buttons  it'd be fine. Needs to be an enter button  but could just be the same as well. Mm-hmm. Shouldn't we maybe lose a point on fashion  go to a three? 'Cause we've lost the overall spongy feel. 'Cause it doesn't seem right that it just hasn't changed at all. Alright. Did we decide what that was  which button it was? On the volume ones? Right. Um  can I just check if that's a cherry or an apple? Did we decide against the apple because of Apple Mac? And did we make it a cherry officially? Right. So were we aiming for a certain target on that scale? Right. So do we have anything else to discuss? Huh. Yeah. I think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project. I mean a remote control isn't the most um kind of fancy thing that you could imagine designing. I can't think of a better example at the minute. Well it's a different application of it. Yeah. Well leadership's a bit of a funny one  isn't it. But we can't really all fairly comment on leadership because you are the Project Manager. You were the leader. So our experience of leadership wasn't really as much as yours. Yeah  very nice. But I mean  I d I don't I'm not sure I see the value in these. I mean  they record what you're writing  and then what do you do with it? Where do you get the recording? Do you plug the computer or something? Right. I think you watch a video of it kind of. Voice um recognition thing. Pretty much. No  you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere. Yeah  you have to you have to close that window. 'Cause that's the save one isn't it  so And then find it. You pass it round to have a look. Mm very nice. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So it is  yeah. Cherry would be alright actually. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Copyright  yeah. What's this this one? What's that one there? Oh  okay. Right. Uh-huh. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'll see if I can find them. Have Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Right. So if you had to do a presentation or will you just work it on the prototype? That's the pr Okay. we should plug it in. Do you wanna plu do you wanna plug it in into the the back of that one. We could do it as we d go along  the production costs  looking at the prototype. Well do we'll do it on the prototype  so do two  see how much it is. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think you just do one  don't you  for the I think I think it's just it's just a one. Else I thi I think I think the button supplement i is just a supplement for all the buttons made in a different material  rather than per button. I don't know though. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. You've just gone off the window into another one. It's on the bottom row. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  we have to have it Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we've got it now first  and then sort of make decisions about what needs to be changed after? Okay. Right um  I have a little thing. So  we've all got a note of it's thirteen point seven  isn't it  with everything we want on. Yeah  I just had a presentation to do. Mm-hmm. Mm. Right okay um  This is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the the prototype we've got here. And so the method is that the design team makes a prototype  and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated. And those ones are gonna be in response to sort of market research  and also finance  I guess. And do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven  so if it's neither true nor false  then that's four. So  I got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well  at the end. Um so  We have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy. Um The whether the product demonstrates technical innovation. Whether it's easy to use. Whether it's incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer. And whether it's a sort of recognisable Real Reaction product. And I have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently  so I'll go over here. Right. So the first one is um  does the product look and feel fancy. So if we do a sort of a one So Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Of but I think What Is one false  or is t one true? I forgot. One's true  and okay. Seven's fal Four is neutral  okay. So Right. Okay. Right. I gonna put underneath so I've got some more space. So  false is seven  true is one  and So uh say about a two for fancy  you think? Okay. Okay  well d you do an average at the end  I don't know. Um Uh-huh. This this is just this is just for like the look. Does it sort of look fancy rather than functional. So Yeah  so that so sh should we go for a a two on that? 'Kay. And I mean  how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon? D yeah. Okay. So  what about the pr The prototype as it is  we've got we've got the speech recognition on it  haven't we. But not the kinetic. Alright  so So it doesn't It's pretty The prototype as it is isn't sort of um fulfilling the Okay. Yeah. Right  okay. Mm-hmm. S I'm just gonna check my email. I'm just gonna check exactly what it said in the email for um the product. Okay. But I Okay. Yeah.  I just read the email again and it sort of says it's evaluate the design sort of as it is  I think  so I think we need to think about finance after we've sort of evaluated that design. I don't know whether we're doing it in the wrong order or something or. So  I mean does this need to go up a bit or something  'cause we've got both the both the um the speech Yeah. Yeah. Um  for for innovation  so we've got the speech the speech thing  and Do you reckon a two? Okay. Two. And the next one is I'll have to get it back up now. Okay. Um Say about a three maybe? It's a two. Yeah  this is This Yeah. So this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleek technology and all that sort of thing  as well as having the logo on and all that. So sort of Is it sort of a recognisable product. Does it fit in with our other other products  which uh are sort of coffee makers and spacecraft. What do y Yeah. Uh-huh. So Two or three? Yeah. Two or three. How Two. Okay. Right. Yeah. Yeah we s yeah  I think we sort of add them up so sort of at an average is gonna be I'm just gonna do this in my head. One point eight isn't it or something. I think  anyway. So yeah  pretty close to a two. So So it's I mean it's pretty good at the moment  but it's gonna get worse  isn't it. But we've gotta try and make sure it doesn't get too bad. Yeah. Do you wanna plug it into yours so we can get up the the finances I'm not sure. Yeah. it's come on already. Mm. Yeah. Different different colours  yeah. Yeah  I was I was thinking that because maybe maybe the sort of rubber case is a bit less in sort of the corporate identity than the sort of you know sleeker plastic case. Lose a little bit on the fashion  yeah  but And then Yeah. Yeah. Well I thin I think you you you just need two for the special colour 'cause it's just two supplements  you know. One original colour and then sort of two supplements  I think maybe. Okay. So we only ne we only need two for that. 'Cause I mean these these are moulded. The one colour's gonna be moulded out of a piece of plas uh of rubber  isn't it. Right. Yeah  that Yeah. Okay  so tha So shall we do a Well  um Yeah. Yeah  so Uh So it's w if we've if we've put in for another special form on a button  then maybe they could be a different shape. Like we got a cherry one. Maybe other ones could be something else shaped. I don't know. That would be poss seeing as seeing as it's cheaper to make them a different seeing as we've got  you know  we've made it a a special form  so And that would sort of maybe keep us close on the sort of the fashion type one. And it would sort of  you know  keep it quite fancy as well  I don't know. Well you could Yeah. Yeah  I mean the volume buttons could be lemons or something  maybe. Okay. So  we've what have we what have we rid of. We got rid of the plastic. Is it The rubber. Yeah. Yeah. But uh So I mean  we've got we got rid of the rubber case  but we've now s we now sort of got an extra form  and an extra colour for the buttons. So maybe in terms of sort of fanciness and fashionability  we're pretty much the same  maybe. So  I mean we could maybe put two again on them. Yeah. Yeah. And what about the sort of innovation? Do you think Okay. And then  the corporate identity. Yeah. Whether whether that's considered to be sort of part of the corporate identity  I don't know. I mean  it's maybe not. I mean Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay  well I mean We cou Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Hey  what what what's the company colour? Did you get told what the company colour is or Oh right. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Okay. Uh-huh. 'Cause you've got sort of we've got point two to play with if you really wanted to. Another colour. Or would that be t Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Shall we save the point two for profitability then? Hmm. Yeah. I mean it's the sort of thing that  I mean  you wanna pick up the controller and just hit a button quickly to change the channel or volume. So  if it's dead obvious  then that's fine. But if you're opening the panel and you're looking and you're tuning  then you're paying a bit more attention. So it may be sort of different colour buttons isn't so important. 'Cause you Yeah. So Yeah  I mean so we've dropped the cost  but Same sort of function? The criteria? It's alright. Just made a load of money. Well  but I think we said that w Because you got rid of the rubber  we put an extra an extra sort of fruit um shape on one of the buttons. le lemon sh I think well  we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something. Or something like that. Yeah. Did did you have to have a rubber case  though  for rubber buttons? Or was it the other way around? Right  okay. Yeah. So that so we've saved Saved two Euros on that. Mm-hmm. Well  we're aiming for um one for all of them. M but it really has to fit into the budget  so I guess we just have to adjust things to get it i in the Which is fair enough. Yeah. Yeah  I think most Yeah. Yep. I don't know. What's on the agenda? Uh-huh. Finish your meeting now. Yeah. Okay. Oh. I thought some of the divisions though between sort of the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary. Yeah. Well  we were finding out various things in in be in-between the meetings  and they didn't the one meeting didn't always follow on for the other one  you know  sort of we had things thrown in at the second meeting where  you know  you'd looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness  but in the first one you'd also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons  and I don't understand why it would be in separate meetings that you'd do that. You know  you'd sort of you'd probably present it at one or something like that. Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  the thing itself. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. But think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control  in a way. I mean it depends what sort of business you're in  I guess. I mean this one seems. From the website it looks it's quite innovative  but we're coming up with some bucket shop product aren't we that's  you know  fifteen quid. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I mean if you look at their products on their website here  Real Reaction  I mean it's all pretty high-tech and cutting edge. And Yeah. Yeah. we did find a new idea  I mean sort of a kinetic remote control. I've never seen one of them before. batteries  I think. So Mm yeah. Yeah. Mm. That went okay  yeah. Mm-hmm  yeah. I don't think sort of the budget um allowed us to do anything Well  I mean I don't think it I just don't think it fitted in with the rest of their products. I mean  they've got all these sort of  you know  high definition D_V_D_ and portable seven inch d um lightweight computer screens  and uh I'm thinking  do you know  one cheap remote control doesn't really fit in. Surely they they should produ Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It worked. Comput computers could be a bit difficult at times but I think there's a little there's a little um chi There's a little there's a little chip  I think you must plug it into something and it produces a I don't know. Whether it just produces a big image of sort of everything you've written or something  and Page after page. Yeah. Kinetic powered remote control. Um  what was the other one? Vo yeah. Voice recognition  yeah. S Almost. To fill in these fill in these questionnaires Oh no. Hmm? I think that we've got two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting. ,The project manager decided to start by looking at costs instead of the prototype presentation because the original design was too expensive and had to be changed. The group discussed which features should be dropped. The group decided that the LCD screen was integral to their design  but dropped the speech recognition. They decided to drop all the buttons in favour of an integrated scroll push-button  and to use a hand dynamo instead of kinetic energy as a power source. The marketing expert led the prototype evaluation  based on the new design. The group were satisfied with the overall score of 3.1. The industrial designer and user interface designer worked on a drawing of the new design  while the project manager and marketing manager worked on the final report. The project manager led an evaluation of the project process. The group thought that they worked well together  especially after the first meeting. They were happy with the room for creativity  but thought they were limited by the budget. They preferred the digital pens to the SMARTboard.  They had mixed feelings about using PowerPoint. 
Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. P Well the only problem I can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls. If you just kind of take away everything that they're used to knowing  that's gonna be quite a change. It might Mm. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. But look at the importance of them. The volume settings. Yeah. They're not used often but they are quite important when they're used. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Hmm. Oh  you have to hit like function and F_ something. F_ eight. Dunno. Oh yeah  it's going. Oh yeah  they might be movable. Oh yeah  they're all they're not connected to anything on the table  you just leave 'em on and walk around with 'em. Mm. Mm. Yes  mm. Which one does this plug into? That one. I can't did you could you see it on you screen when it That's not cool. Oh well. Anyways. Um alright  yeah  so um I'll just do my presentation on the working design uh. Oh there we go. Okay um just at the m yeah the whole sort of method of how the remote control works. Uh the basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another sh system  the the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ player or whatever. Um and it does this uh by well  you need to start off you need an energy source and this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit chip and the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages uh within the remote um which will then be sent to the uh the television  the D_V_D_ to tell that what to do. Um and you need a user interface  which controls the chip and thus the messages and uh the user interface is that's basically just you kn the s sorta design of the actual remote which you hold in your hands and what buttons will be on it. Um Oh shoot. Okay. Uh just general findings. Uh what we need uh technically speaking for the remote control is some sort of energy source  uh some sort of user interface  which I think we've mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that. Um a circuit chip within that to uh control and send the messages and um a sender and receiver. And um oops. Uh-huh. This is just sort of a little schematic diagram of what we're looking for. Uh this just kinda represents the energy source which feeds into the circuit chip uh which maybe then we could have that feed into a switch which would send signals f to um a subcomponent and on to a light bulb between so it'll light up once we start once you start pressing buttons. Um also send signals to the um infrared bulb  which will be the part that actually what? Sends signals to the the television. And then you've got your happy little T_V_ watcher there. And so my personal preferences I I just think we need sorta big uh energy source that won't die out  uh perhaps some sort of rechargeable battery or a battery dock you could place it in  so it'd constantly be charged  so you wouldn't have to uh be worrying about it running out of batteries and not changing channels for you. Uh a wide range uh sender-receiver  so that you can hit the buttons from basically anywhere in the room  and the channel'll still be changed. Uh also definitely a user-friendly interface um and I think we've all sort of mentioned adding a a locating device on it  so when it does get stuck under the couch cushions  as they inevitably do  you can find them easily. And that's pretty much it. Mm. Mm. Mm. Just having one that's guaranteed to last five to ten years? Oh  cool. Yeah  fair enough. Mm  mm. Mm yeah. Mm-mm. Mm. 'Cause I only remember to charge my cell phone uh when battery dies. And that's pretty much yeah. Yeah  when it turns itself off  that's when I plug it in  yeah. Yeah  think that's a good idea. Mm. They usually have the little light uh source  I dunno what the heck they're called  the but yeah  the little cells that Yeah. Mm. Most of them  don't they have sort of a combination of the two  like when there is light  they'll work off the light  and if there isn't  they'll kick into this battery  so we can maybe do something like that whereas there is a battery  but if there's enough light  then it's using the light  so that it's not actually draining the battery all the time  but you will have the battery there for when you need it. Mm. Mm. Oh  it depend if it's uh depends who who's using it  who's just sitting there clicking clicking clicking clicking  yeah. Yeah  then they're clicking a lot  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Yep. Hmm. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Okay. Cool. Uh I don't mind. Uh can I steal the cable? Cheers. I got a how do I start there? That one. Cool. Well these are functionality requirements from the our our guys down in the the research lab. Took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what um is needed by people and what they want to see. Um everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff. And general opinions about current current remotes. See that  as we kinda noticed  seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly. So some kind of a new style should be incorporated that's less ugly. Uh along with um looking less ugly  if it looks better  eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it. Which is a a plus for us  if we can make it look better  it'd be uh more cost effective and we can put the price up. Current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user. I can empl I kinda take that to mean as um they they don't uh they  yeah  they only use they only work for the television or yeah like as in in my flat I've got six remote controls for a stereo system  a digital box  a D_V_D_ player  a video player and T_V_. If it was uh I mean th my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time and multiple remotes aren't really matched well to my behaviour. Uh again  seventy five percent is seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot. I took to mean that they just they use it a lot  they use it regularly rather than standing up and manually change channels or volume. And uh yeah  uh I think the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons  'cause uh wh if we got a remote that like well we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext  but uh oh and we're going to see uh on the uh that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used and used very aren't considered relevant by the user. So I think maybe fewer buttons  which also make the design look sleeker  I dunno. Uh um yeah and uh frustrations of like people losing remote control. I dunno maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the T_V_ or maybe that's b it would have to incorporate  but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control. Maybe like it'll beep or something. And um  yep  the uh time taken to learn new remote controls is Uh don't want to make it too complicated  easy to use for uh new like first time users and stuff. And uh repetitive strain injury  I suppose we should make it more comfortable and make ma possibly even use have to make it  yeah  fewer buttons  like I was saying about the whole mice the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable. Maybe don't even have to hold it as such. But uh yeah. It also asked um if we would if people would pay more for speech recognition and younger people say they would. And uh there was another section on our on the report for uh L_C_D_ displays  but the data wasn't there  so. I don't actually know what the results for that were  so. May be incrementally emitting  but yeah. And uh it would cut out the R_S_I_ as well if you Yeah  um oh yeah  so possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design. Oh  I've got some other things I couldn't fit onto this presentation. Um. You see this okay? Almost no? It's sorry it's a bit. I'll read out to you. Uh functionality  uh like people's opinions on functionality  the relevance to the remote and how often they're used. So um like the power. Using the using the d swi the power switch to switch on T_V_ is a high relevance of nine  but it's not frequently used. You see what I mean? Whereas channel selection  which is very high relevance is used the most. So m we can maybe even start to cut down on or I was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use. Maybe like uh a folding ledge or something. So that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings  which are low relevance and rarely used. And keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily Oh yeah. Yeah  like the one that like slides back and the buttons are concealed underneath. Just remove them completely? Uh yeah. Um no this is for pay more for speech recognition. Yeah  that's true. Or even I mean you could even just have it left on. You could just put it down once on top your T_V_ and never have to Yeah. B_B_C_ one. Oh yeah. Mm-mm. Relevance of two out of ten  yeah. Yeah. Stand out. Uh I just had a thought actually  sorry to interrupt. Uh you were saying about um it could technical problems of like uh someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed we could maybe have like an activation word. 'Cause I've seen I've seen this used on computers before  where you just you address the remote  you address the computer  and then give it a command. Oh I see. Oh yeah  I see. Mm-hmm  yeah. I mean I'm just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote. Mm. Oh no I I interrupted you  sorry. Oh okay. Um well  I was just kinda wrapping up there. Yeah  I was thinking um  yeah  maybe such things are relevant. We could make things much more f I think the the eighty percent of people would spend more on uh a remote uh that looks better  combined with uh decrease the or take out the limited functio functions that we don't really use much. alright take out teletext  but as for channel settings and stuff it might it might um turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away. But  since if we're marketing a more kind of fashionable approach then it'd it would be fashion and fashion over practicality. Oh  we could  yeah. We c yeah  we could even have it as like a yeah the buttons control this and the voice functions control the f things that you would do all the time  so. So uh yeah  if we could uh power on and channel selection and and volume selection  wouldn't have to really Yeah and probably it would look better as well. Yeah. yeah. Lined with numbered buttons and Uh yeah  yeah  that's everything. Do you want the cable? F_ eight. Uh  give it about twenty seconds  or so. Yeah. Hmm. Mm-hmm. It could have like uh know like a cordless phone in your house it s got like a base that sits there all the time. I suppose  yeah. Yeah. Uh. That sounds pretty good  yeah. Mm-hmm. W like like this um this uh market research thing says number of times per hour that it's used  channel selection a hundred and sixty eight times per hour. Yeah. But then again  if you think it of the amount of  you know amount of use it's like That's it's less than a second  um. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah  like in the email of television only. In fact they're in the constraints email that I got. Didn't you mention the teletext  just television only? Oh okay. Oh yeah. Sorry. It could be oh uh I was just gonna say uh maybe like the flip phones that they use? Have you seen the new mo mobile phones that flip out and they have the like texting  and then the numbers on one side  so you could have the most used buttons on top and flip it out or something. Yeah. That might be the Maybe i Yeah  have a big kind of like the satellite box or the cable box and have it just go on the T_V_ and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are  you won't lose it. No. Oh. Yeah  that's true. Yeah. Okay well  I can do mine. Yeah  let's see if I can make this work. Um. Oh. Is it doing Okay. Oh okay. Okay  so this is just about the technical functions. So the method  I looked online for examples of other similar products and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and um identify what the necessary things are  what people are what you really wanna have a remote control do. Um and then there are two different kinds that I found. There's a user centred one and an engineering centred one which I will have pictures of and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be. So these are the two different ones. This one um this is the user centred  it has uh quite a few mm uh um fewer buttons and then this is the engineering centred  which has a lot more buttons  and probably this is one that people complain about  about having too many buttons that you don't use. So basically  what a remote control is is you it's to send messages to the television set  you know  turn on  off  switch the channels and the volume and things such as that. And so for this product it's gonna be television only  and then it has to have the uh logos for the company and the colours. And so  for my personal preferences  I think this one is easier to use and has quite a you know  fewer buttons. Um we want something that sends messages easily to the television and I was kind of wondering about this example that they have. It looks kind of narrow at the top  and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top  then that would be easier. Um and so we have to decide what's gonna make our product different. E the unique style  maybe have it light up so it's visible in the dark  um the changeable face-plates  and the lighting up and visible I was when we were talking about havi losing it  maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that  so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that. So that's my presentation. Yeah. F they probably clip to you. Oh. Hmm I think it's all there. H Oh yeah. That's kind of strange. Yeah  people are pro I would think that people might forget I mean people forget to put their cordless phones back on there  so. Yeah. No. Um. Do they make batteries that last that long? Yeah  they have that little solar Yeah. Mm. Yeah  some people are Yeah. Yeah. Per hour? Wow. That's a lot. Yeah. Though I think with digital T_V_  like I know on my cable box  you're not supposed to do that because the channel can't keep up with it if you just press it like that  so you're supposed to use the menu and go through the different channels that way instead of Uh-oh. Yeah. Um Oh I just have one question. So are we doing just the television or are we doing so not D_V_D_ players  we okay  okay. Okay. Yeah. Oh okay. Okay. Okay  welcome to the second meeting of this uh design group. Um I'll briefly go through the uh notes of the of the last meeting uh just done in in note form and I haven't attributed anything to individuals  because we're working strictly as a team here and uh n nobody's working equally  so uh. Um we we s we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the uh b a boring shape and boring colour. Um and and we s we saw that the um what we needed to do was to to make sure the device um controls several items  that switching was easy  that you shouldn't need to point the thing at uh anything in particular  um that it need to be contoured to make it interesting  that the keys might be concave  simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of. Um should have interchangeable fascias so people can personalise it  um illuminated so that people can see it in dark rooms. Um and that people might want it as as in addition to their existing remote controls. Um and that it sh it should just always work  whenever you uh um mm uh use it. And that it shouldn't be too small  mm that it it gets lost. Um. Now uh uh I'll shortly ask for for three three presentations. Uh before I do that  however  I will go through some new project requirements that um the the management have placed on us and uh will be challenging in terms of what we discussed at the first meeting. Um the uh the ma the management has had it's own thoughts on this and uh the they don't necessarily agree with with what we uh we thought. Um and and then we'll as a result of that we will then talk through the the functions that we see the the device um actually b carrying out  and we have uh forty minutes to do this in and I uh Anyway. Okay. Now  the n the new requirements are um the the management team see that um teletext is no longer of any importance given the uh the rise of the internet. Um and and they want it only to cover televisions. Um now  what is not q quite clear from their directive is whether they mean th they don't want it to cover teletext or whether they don't want it to cover  you know  videos  D_V_D_s  um satellite boxes  which uh I mean we saw as being fundamental to the uh to the exercise. The um the actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only. Um and on that basis um I I think we we need to bear that in mind  um but possibly uh keep at the backs of our minds that the reality that people even when they uh no longer they don't look at teletext anymore  they certainly do look at other things. Um the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours. Um the the logo uh being at b the bottom of the screen there  the the the two R_s in grey against uh a yellow background. Um now this doesn't necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the t to the market. But uh do do introduce some some constraints as to how we might do that. Um it also has to be simple  which to some extent goes along w with the first one  and that we've already said that it must be simple 'cause that's what people want anyway. Um but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly  which um mm uh is is is their choice  but uh um we we need to talk that through. Um okay  so uh after the meeting it'll be summarised and uh um notes sent out and uh etcetera. Okay  so we'll first of all mm have individual reports from everybody. Um again I there is no order of precedence here um so I I I'll leave it up to you to who who who thinks they would like to go go first? P fine. Oh sorry  you can indeed. Oh  if you click on the um uh the one that that looks like a projection screen  no the one to the right of that. That one. Mm. Mm. Gosh  must be some telly addicts out there if they get R_S_I_ from their television remote  is all I can say. Mm. Right. Mm. Yeah  I must say that um the uh I c can't remember what um f you know phone service I was using the other day  but that had sorta speech recognition which worked uh remarkably well  so that is indeed a uh um a thought and it it cuts out uh I was was gonna say  you can't get a lot of R_S_I_  j just get jaw ache. Okay  sorry. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I mean Yeah. Mm. Hmm  hmm. Uh. Should we actually bite the bullet here? If people really don't use those buttons to any extent at all um remove them altogether. We we could actually have we could actually have a remote control with um I wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition  given that um the Um now the the age structure we were looking at um I mean w we had usage by age structure  what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups. Now do we know whether they Forty no sorry for forty five to fifty five age group  uh to put myself right in the middle of it  um u use remote controls to a great extent. Yes we That would 've speech recogn right. So  we're looking at um well again  we don't know the relative proportion the relative numbers in the age groups. If we wanted something different  truly different  then the buttonless remote control w would be it. But if you just lift it up and say  channel one or B_B_C_ It c well it I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the  you know  the sound from the television  because if somebody actually on the television says uh uh  you know  I_T_V_ and you're watching B_B_C_ then then it might um change itself  so it probably needs to be um possibly actually need a button on it just to activate it. Or or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use. And and then just say  oh I don't know  a thought and and then uh I mean that that would certainly be uh truly different. Um 'cause uh you know audio settings  nought point eight percent. I mean if they weren't there  would people miss them? Vol volume  yes um th w we need to s identify things that people actually need and and it's a function of frequency and relevance. And um I would say ignoring ig ignoring power for the moment  um the channel and volume and th w w given given that we've been told to ignore teletext. Uh channel and volume are the only ones that uh would appear to be essential. Um. So we if we can design something that that looks interesting  know  or looks different  um incorporates the the logo and and the colours and um we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it's the yellow and grey  um and uh I dunno  buttons or or buttons as an option. Do  please. Mm-hmm. You cer certainly could. Depe uh i depends whether um if we want to make this so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say B_B_C_ one. Um okay  I mean you could print actually print it on the uh device itself. Um. S th this I th that's always gonna be a problem I think. Um and I I I s so I suppose one um could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one. Anyway  sorry  carry on. Do you want to just carry on with or no no  no uh b I was in the middle of in the middle of your report there. Mm okay. Mm-hmm. S s we could we could make it dual function voice recognition and still have buttons on it um 'cause we're Certainly could. Yeah  yeah. The I mean the the advantage of doing away the buttons altogether is it makes the thing cheaper. No  it cou certainly opens up the possibility for making it uh  you know  visually very distinctive. Um 'cause you know  it does not have to be a oblong box. Mm  yeah. Okay  who sorry  have you have you finished there Andy? Yep  yep. Um given that we've already had a extensive discussion uh. Ah  there we go. Alright. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm  yeah. Okay  can I um I'm actually gonna use the um it's gonna cause great technical problems over here. I'm actually gonna use the Yes  rather than the uh the the traditional in fact  um I won't even go that far. Um something like this shape  you know  sort of something that you can that's sort of a more vertical shape  um that you you sort of hold in your hand  um  well I'm trying to think uh uh uh l uh l such as I mean um something you hold up like that  possibly with a couple of buttons like that  but with the the entire top with the  you know  the uh the infrared or whatever source. Uh so that you know  it's flying off in all directions  so that uh um uh again the n need to look at the the the technicalities of um actually achieving that in terms of whether the  you know  the power requirements of the uh such a source  um you know  compromise the our our need for uh you know  it it being um mm permanently uh you know  available. Uh whether whether different technology um I mean th all all these remotes are presumably infrared  and like they have been for a long time. Uh we we possibly need to be looking at at at something different  um you know  short range  not like the old uh radio remote controls where you'd change next door's telly when you change yours. Um but uh uh I think basically i if we're going for i if minimum number of buttons is our priority  then we should  as I say  r know  really bite the bullets and and reduce the buttons to absolute minimum  you know  possibly with backup channel and volume buttons and on off. Um and nothing else. Um so that it can al it could uh almost end up like that  but again  except that um you know the risk of losing it. Um anyway okay um so Kate  wh what are your uh your thoughts on this? Okay. Uh it seems seems to me there are a number of fundamental decisions to make before we um I think your point about the the big energy source is uh a very valid one. Um I don't suppose we've got any statistics on the the life expectancy of uh remote controls  particularly sort of independent ones. Um given you know  the number of things you buy these days  which you know  have a a a lithium whatever battery in  that's uh  you know never needs replacing. Um perhaps we should have the the disposable remote control  uh um you know  one some sort of typical usage. You know  the the the battery will last know  five  ten years. By which time I mean when all's said and done  the digital television will be taking over in that time scale. Um uh uh p perhaps we should  know  reduce the uh  you know  the sort of moving parts even more by not even having a battery compartment and uh Yeah  and if if anybody manages to run it down  we'll we'll give 'em a new one. Um it's  you know  it's what it saves in cost and you know there there's a well  it's actually a marketing gimmick. I mean it's hardly a gimmick  it's uh it's totally practical. Uh so I th think you know the idea of a rechargeable one is um uh unless you're really high tech and it sort of just recharges itself if it's n by  you know  magnetic waves or whatever  if if it Yeah. Are are people really gonna use it though? Um. I I th I think Yeah  it's um I mean I know that somei times my my wife goes out in the morning and says oh I should have put the phone on to charge and then then she's had those for so long that if she hasn't worked that out by now. Um. When it yeah  wh when it's died is a problem. Yeah  yeah  yeah  so uh um what so wh what what do we think about the um the the permanent mm battery? Is the uh you know  we we we are really going for the ultimate in ex uh external simplicity here. Um you know  cut cost within the manufacturing and uh you know  if we have a high tech interior  then then that that sh may well be cost effective. I mean th th certainly. Um I can't think of anything off the s top of my head  but there are certainly things that you buy. I mean calculators for example. Som well some do  I mean th th but there are battery ones that um are you know  sort of permanently sealed. In in fact I'd Yeah  uh uh Yeah  I I mean th th this needs going t into the technology a bit. I mean the the actual time that a remote control is actually operating I would think is i is is probably  you know  no more than minutes in its entire life. Um. If  but I say if if people are getting R_S_I_ from it then uh then uh then then perhaps we're looking at the wrong market n Right. Oh  I must admit I hadn't um I'd I'd missed that. That does sound excessive. Yeah. Well that's right  and and I I don't I don't even know whether the I don't even know whether the s the signal lasts as long as you actually keep the button pressed  or whether it's just a sorta tenth of a second  no matter how long you press it for  I don't know I don't actually know. Um. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Right  so I've got a message to say five minutes  I dunno how long ago that appeared. Um 'cause we're we're getting um right  so I'd I need to sum up very quickly here um. We're looking at extreme simplicity. We're looking at a radically different shape. Possibly no buttons at all um  but if you can incorporate um channel change and volume buttons um in into the design  then then that's fine. Um in the I mean the the role of the of the um the user interface des designer becomes b you know more important here  because  you know  shape is no longer an a uh um a serious constraint. But we clearly only need th the main buttons  although  uh if clearly only need the main functions. Um I don't see why we shouldn't go for voice recognition um and the the only buttons that I think we need are channel control  volume control and on off. Um it needs to incorporate the corporate logo  uh the the grey and yellow colour scheme and there's no reason why we can't introduce um interchangeable uh covers. Um uh d so does that accurately summarise what we've discussed? Right. So uh Yeah. We are doing just the television. No. I think that's quite clear from the the information that we've been given  no? Right. Oh yeah well th that's one I s that's one I sent you  which which was my interpretation of uh of the uh what came down from from head office. Um That's that that that that's their uh their view. Okay  so uh we can all give some thought to that uh for for the next meeting  thank you very much indeed. ,The industrial designer and user interface designer presented their prototype design  made of yellow rubber and hard plastic  with large  mostly blue buttons  a joystick and LCD screen. Led by the marketing expert  the group evaluated the prototype on a scale of one to seven  based on a set of evaluation criteria. The overall rating was two. The project manager calculated the production costs  which were too high at fifteen Euros. The group discussed how to make the design cheaper  and decided to keep the LCD screen  but to remove the special colour and replace the joystick with regular push-buttons. Finally the project manager led an evaluation of the project process before closing the meeting. Overall  the group were satisfied with the creativity  teamwork and available equipment  although the marketing expert thought the SMARTboard and laptops were sometimes distracting and not that helpful. 
I'm Stephanie and I am the User Interface Designer. So you want us to draw it and then talk about it? Or just draw it? Okay. Why don't we do both. Right. Mm  I gotta think about it for a second like. Uh Does it have to be functional  trendy and user friendly? Um. Okay  I'll draw. I'll draw one. Make sure my things here. Uh-oh. Right. Okay  my favourite animal is see. Oops. Yeah  it's Yeah  I guess it has a fin on top too  yeah. It's my dolphin. I like its tail. Um  no  I think dolphins are really uh I dunno  they're smart and they they're cute and they like swimming and that's cool  like they're graceful yeah  and they're so Yeah they're sleek and they look intelligent and I don't know  they're I guess it's the whole like binocular vision thing. Yeah he he doesn't look that smart. He's a I dunno um they're I think it's cool the the um the interaction that or the th things that the reasons people seem to like you know you get ex you know people are sitting on the beach and p they're like oh look there's dolphins and it's kinda like but they're you know they jump around in the water and they're happy and they're mammals  but they swim. And the pen's dying. Horse. And furry. Textile tactile  tactile remote control. You're dragging a you have a tail. Sorry can you just say that what's the what are our price goals again? Okay. I was thinking that too. I think we should design something that has like a so you can like somehow like you I mean you always know where your T_V_ is  so just have a call button  I've always wanted that  so like you can push a button on your T_V_ Yeah  yeah yeah yeah  so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't yeah I mean it but like I mean just I mean like your phone even just has so like it can vibrate  it can light up and make noise and I dunno. Yeah. Yeah  or if it had a yeah. Yeah  I mean Yeah. Yeah  in in the couch. I dunno  it seems like though that that would be hard  'cause you not you're not gonna be lazy anyway and Yeah so we the project is now couches and remote controls. Yeah. Yeah. Bigger. Hand-sized. It can't be that hard to put some kind of a noise on it. Or like or like a light thing. You know. I dunno. Yeah. Or make it mobile so it runs around and comes come find you yeah. That would be really I'm sure we could do that for twenty five Euros a pop. Yeah. Uh. I also think though that it shouldn't have too many buttons  'cause I hate that when they have too many buttons and I mean I know it has to have enough functions but like  I don't know you  just have like eight thousand buttons and you're like  no  you never use half of them. So. That would be cool. Yeah. I mean it just seems like yeah. I guess they would go together somehow? I dunno. I'm thinking kind of Or like you h you see those you know people I'm thinking of like celebrity cribs kind of things when like they have all those these things that at their house you know their their entire house is so electronic  and they have like this one master control that and it's like a hand held like turns on everything sort of control and it has like a screen and like so I think it should be possible to have some kind of a screen  I don't know if it must be it would probably must be ex too expensive though t like I dunno. Yeah  yeah. Yeah that's true. Mm. Well  I guess we have to get to that later  yeah. Furry. Yeah. Mm  mm. Yeah. That's me. Uh  User Interface design. So technical function. What is technical functions exactl I I don't really know what It does but it I just don't really Yeah. What effect should the thing ha should it have  okay. Alright. And working design. Okay. Yeah  yeah. Alright. And how it works  okay. Right. I'm I'm on task. Hi I'm Chiara  I'm the um Marketing Expert. Um  would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment  or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later? We'll get round to that later. My name is Chiara and I'm the Marketing Expert. I think both. Who starts? We ought to decide who starts and all that. No? Uh-huh. Uh yeah. Well I had the cat as well  but uh I've got a spare one. So I'll use the spare one. Um but it's harder to draw um. Um. Uh. Um I don't really know how the legs go  but anyway I will do that. Um  and the main reason is they're pretty. I think they're very pretty and they go well with the environment  and I like the way they run and I used to do horse riding and they're just very sort of sturdy and nice animals. And I like the way um they feel  sort of under under the hand  I think that's pretty much it. Um How many should we sell then? Um  a lot  two two two million  two mi no  more f four million. Four million. And it well it's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty  that'll do four million. It is a lot. Uh. Um  I think one thing is that it should be easy to find bec yeah bec Yeah  yeah yeah yeah yeah. Yeah. And even I think a little light. Um or even a maybe a vib a vibrating thing. I dunno but someth because it's usually under the sofa. In which case you're going to be l but if it has a sort of signal which isn't any sound I don't know if it's expensive maybe to Maybe call is enough. But yeah. Yeah yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah yeah. But even just a thing to attach it to the w you know if you had a thing  a pretty object attached to the wall. But that would really make it more expensive. But it's only a plastic thing  r really  the thing on the wall. Something like that. And the other thing is Not well it needs to be sort of Yeah. I don't think you need a But definitely not well I don't know. No  it can't be  uh-uh. Like spaceship. Right. Um Oh dear. Yeah  yeah yeah. Yeah. Select. Uh. But  would you have the screen on the thing  or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen. Because Because  I don't know if it's I think it's e expensive  if you have if you use the telly screen  'cause the telly's already a screen  then you can pro sort of have a programming function  really easy sort of arrow up and down  on the remote  and then use the telly as a screen. But um But yeah for sure. Something like not it's not on the button but it's telling you what to do  is that what you mean? Right. Mm. Yeah. But like mobile phones have screens and they're cheap. Yeah. Or some it i we can find out probably on the internet how much it's Um. Yeah  and the other thing you said that thing about robust and water um What was the word? Water resistant. No but it's I thought  ah  spot on. Good feel  tact tactile  good tactile feel  maybe something didn doesn't make your hands sweat lot. That's quite annoying. Yeah  clip. Ooh. Um. It says on that email but it It said um It said Yeah like Be a medium between you and the telly I think  that's uh Marketing. Oh it's written here  but um. Okay. I'm Krista and I'm the Industrial Designer. Suppose I can draw an animal  yeah. Yeah. I don't know. They sleep all day  they're easy to draw. I think the pen is running out of Two million. Oh  yeah. Well that's why it's always in the couch. No it really wouldn't be. Yeah  I agree. B_ button and the F_ button  they don't do anything. Yeah I think so. User. The working design is the structure. Um. It was in the email. I wrote down what mine were. Marketing. Here we go. Welcome everybody. Um  I'm Abigail Claflin. You can call me Abbie. 'S see. PowerPoint  that's not it. There we go. So this is our kick off meeting. Um and I guess we should all get acquainted. Let's shall we all introduce ourselves? I think we'll get around to that  yeah. So this is just introductions yeah. Okay. I forgot to s say I'm the Project Manager but I figured you all knew that already  um so. Okay. Um so f here's our agenda for today. Um we're gonna do some tool training  project plan and discuss then close. Um so. So our aim is to produce a remote control that is original  trendy and user friendly. And to do this  we have to um there's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing. So. We'll get to that. Oh there it is. Right. Functional design  conceptual design and detailed design. So throughout our next couple of meetings we'll we'll be covering these things. Um so we're gonna try out our white board. If we'll all draw our favourite animal  to sum up the characteristics of that animal. Okay. Yeah. Both. Yeah. Any volunteers? Does anyone know what they wanna draw? I don't think so. A dolphin. 'S like playing Pictionary. So what characteristics do you like about your animal? They're graceful. Sleek. I don't know how intelligent that one looks. Yes. Does anybody else wanna draw their animal?. Uh-oh there goes the ten. It's a cat. Do you wanna anything? I dunno if the the ah. A horse. That's very good. Yeah. This cord's Uh. Right. Actually I haven't thought of anything yet. Uh It's a pig. So I'm thinking we should design a remote control that's water resistant  strong and furry. What do you think  yeah? This is yeah  well like a cat  you know  soft yeah. Although uh I'll just put there. Right. Oh my gosh  this is disastrous. Sorry about that. Okay. So moving on. Our selling price goal is twenty five Euro and profit aim is fifty million Euro. So I'm guessing that we're not actually in Scotland  we're in some European country. Um  and we will hope to sell this internationally. Um selling price is twenty five Euro. Profit aim fifty million Euro. Anyone a mathematician? So f that's a fifty percent um uh. Um  I don't know what these mean because I didn't actually make the slide-show. Experience with remote control. So I guess we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide what um we would like to see in a convenient  practical  nice remote control. Um so do we have any initial ideas for uh how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the the buttons it should have. Yeah. Yeah. I mean you have it for the portable phone  so why not yeah. What if it had something like um just like a magnet on the back of it and you could I mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base. You know like a portable phone has a base  like just to have a home for it. 'Cause people just stick it on top of their T_V_  but the point of having a remote is not to have to walk over to the T_V_  so Yeah. Yeah. Maybe we should design couches that have the remote control in the side arm. Yeah. Do you think it needs to be bigger to not lose  or does that not factor in? Like Hand hand held size  yeah. Not not huge  but Huh. Little homing device. Um. Okay. So what do we think this remote control should Five minutes. Till the meeting oh right. This is what we have left. Um  oh we just Yeah. You what if um may be a little fancy but what if it had like a little screen  so it has less buttons but it still has all the functions. Like the way a mobile phone does. So you could like um like if you have I dunno if you have satellite if you have a hundred channels  you can the way you do it on your radio is that you uh what do you call it s y yeah but you can programme  so you can programme like your favourite channels  so like if you had a s That's something we could decide. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. I mean  we have to remember our budget is twelve point twelve fifty for to actually make the device. Um but it's something to think about  yeah. I mean we'll have to see how much that would be. Yeah. Oh I was just Yeah. Maybe um just like a simple thing to have a clip on it  like so you can clip it to your like that's another Um. We should probably start wrapping up  um we've got some initial ideas that we can all look into. Um  and come up with some new ones for the next meeting  which will be in another thirty minutes. Um. So. Yeah. The Industrial Designer  what does that stand for  I_D_  yeah um is going to be looking more into the working design. So I guess you'd be looking at lots of the things we discussed about screen and um that sort of thing. The something  what is the U_I_? Yeah  what does it stand for again? User Interface Designer. So that's gonna be more technical. I guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w Yeah  yeah. Um  I guess you'd have to find out. Mm. And the M_E_  what does that stand for? M Marketing  right. Um. So we'll be working on the user requirements  um Yeah. So I guess that wraps it up. I'll see you all in thirty minutes. I just did. ,The project manager opens the meeting by stating that they will address functional design and then going over the agenda. The industrial designer gives his presentation  explaining how remote controls function and giving personal preference to a clear  simple design that upgrades the technology as well as incorporates the latest features in chip design. The interface specialist gives her presentation next  addressing the main purpose of a remote control. She pinpoints the main functions of on/off  channel-switching  numbers for choosing particular channels  and volume; and also suggests adding a menu button to change settings such as brightness on the screen. She gives preference to a remote that is small  easy to use  and follows some conventions. The group briefly discusses the possibility of using an LCD screen if cost allows it  since it is fancy and fashionable. The marketing expert presents  giving statistical information from a survey of 100 subjects. She prefers a remote that is sleek  stylish  sophisticated  cool  beautiful  functional  solar-powered  has long battery life  and has a locator. They discuss the target group  deciding it should be 15-35 year olds. After they talk about features they might include  the project manager closes the meeting by allocating tasks. 
Okay  can I have the laptop over here  or? Okay. Have to get up. Excuse me. Okay. Okay. Okay  so basically I'm gonna present some findings of a study we conducted uh into uh what users want in this remote control. Um so first of all we what we did is we um conducted a an experiment with a hundred test subjects. Um we put them in a in our um usability laboratory and got them to  you know  um play with remote controls  and also to complete  after they'd done that  to complete a questionnaire uh to tell us what they like and what they don't like in remote controls. So basically um the major things we found out was that um basically users don't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market. Um they  you know  seventy five percent of the people we we uh did the experiments on  found that rem remote the remote controls that they'd used in the past were ugly. Completely ugly. Um they they didn't match the operating behaviour of the user  that is  you know  the the way users use remote controls when they're watching T_V_. Um  that the layout of the remote controls didn't match they way that they used it. Um and thirdly they say that w half of the users that we um tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that uh are on remote controls. Um so we collect we also some collected some usage statistics uh based on how these test subjects were using their remote control. And from this we basically came up with the figure that the channel buttons  the channel selection buttons are the most by far the most used buttons on the remote control. Um and you can see they're used a hundred and sixty eight times per hour on average  um  while the user's watching T_V_. Um the closest button that was used  well the cl the button that was used that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button  um which was used fourteen times per hour  followed by the volume button  which was four times per hour  um  all the other  all the other um buttons  such as ch um audio and picture selection um configuration buttons and things were used  you know  l approx well less than or equal to one times per hour. Um we also asked users um which buttons had the most importance to them  you know  which which buttons they felt were the most important buttons on on the remote control. And basically they came they said the channel  volume  and power buttons had the highest relevance to users  um note that only power was very infrequently used  it only had a b a a fr usage frequency of about one times per hour  but users ranked it as having a very very high relevance. Um and the audio and picture settings had a very that well the users thought that um w the audio and picture settings were very uh weren't very important to them um  and they used them very infrequently a as well. So we asked users what what um frustrates them the most about um current remote controls. And fifty percent of the users said that uh what frustrates them is losing the remote control um somewhere in the room and not being able to find it. Um they also said that it um it takes a lot of time to learn a new remote control  especially when there's many buttons and it's a  you know  a c a a unintuitive interface. Um and then thirdly  they some users commented on the fact that the the you know the way that you have to hold and press buttons on a remote control ar are bad and um cause u repetitive strain injury. We also asked some users about some specific features that they'd like to see in the on the remote control. In particular  do they want an L_C_D_ d display  and secondly  do they think speech recognition uh is a useful feature to have on a remote control. Um basically our findings are that um amongst a younger age groups uh the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes. They want these features  they want these high technology features. Um for instance  ninety one percent of pe of people aged between fifteen and twenty five said yes  they want these features. Whereas um the the trend was as users as users um became older and older uh they were less likely to want these sort of features in a um in a remote control. So I guess it depends on where we're focusing our our market. Um and as our company motto is putting fashion in electronics  um I think we're focusing on the younger younger um target demographic  and so maybe we should think about adding these sort of high technology features into our remote control. That's my dic that's my presentation. Thank you. Yeah  it's true  but  you know  they're features that users want  so it's And our production cost of twelve fifty Euros per per unit is fairly high I think  so I think we can afford to to add these sort of features into our remote. It is true. That's the wrong one  I think. Okay. I have a question. Do you think radio waves um will interfere with other appliances in the home? Okay. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Are we um are we planning to take an off the shelf an O_E_M_ component for the radio wave circuit  or are we planning to construct our own circuit board? Okay s So we just buy a circuit board and Okay. Okay. Okay. What how much more expensive? Are we talking three times more expensive? Or ten times more expensive? Or Okay. Yeah yeah. That's still a lot. I think it's it's probably not worth spending the extra money  because I mean all the other remote controls on the market have infra-red  so people don't expect anything other than infra-red. So it's not worth spending the extra money. Yeah. Yeah. But I think  based on my usability studies I th I feel that users are prioritise the look and the feel and the trendiness above  you know  the difference between infra-red or radio waves. So I think we're better off spending money in the usability phase. Okay. Mm. Well  should we start with just the core  the basic functions that we need. And then we can move on to the more advanced features. Okay  well  I mean the obvious one is changing channels. Yeah. Yeah  okay. Yeah  I Ah yeah. To have some feedback. Yeah. We could maybe also c um incorporate Petre's idea of the um slider for the volume  with the channel. So we c you could quickly just through many channels. For the channels  perhaps. So we've got channel and volume. Um. I think so. I think basically the core functions we want  and then more advanced ones. Yeah. I don't Oh  I don't but I don't think we're we're the ones. I mean this remote control we're developing is a generic control for all T_V_s  I think. Okay. But then you don't want to make the L_C_D_ display too complicated at the same time. I mean there's always we can always have these l less often used functions hidden somewhere  under a cover or at the back of under a slide or some Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So we have five minutes left. Um. So I think s the settings we th we are agreeing are agreed that they're required. It's just how to a Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Uh  okay  what else? I mean a power button's obviously uh required. Uh  well I think when they say power button they mean to turn the T_V_ on and off. But if you're watching T_V_ for two hours  you don't want your T_V_ to turn off after five five minute I mean based on our usability studies again  um pe um people said that the power button was v a very relevant button. Um  you know  it was nine out of ten re relevance. Okay. B Okay. I think we need to concentrate on the  you know  the major usage of the th of the control  which is you sit down  you turn on your T_V_  you change channels  you change the volume  you turn the T_V_ off. Um and all the other f functionality is not used very often. Yeah. I think a button. I think it should be a bu Its own button on the front. Okay. S What about things like the clock and um timers? Uh um  you know  some func some features on the control to display a time  or t to display Probably not. It's a questi yeah  it's a trade-off. 'Kay. Okay simple. Very  yeah okay  very occasionally. But I do use the I do use the display of the time quite often  but Yeah. Yeah that's okay  that's true. Okay  so no time button. Okay. Okay  cool. Okay Thank you. Okay. B you think uh I I'm User Interface Manager. Okay. Okay. If I could go there with this cable. Sh okay. Where's delete button? Okay. Oh I'm sorry. Okay. Oh. Presentation three? Oh. Okay  so here is my presentation about technical function design. I will talk about different components and s of system and how they react together. Okay  uh  first what is a remote control? Simply it's a device  as you know  for uh  for sending some commands by some waves to uh another device to to tell different commands uh with this device. And the main idea we don't use any cable and we can rec react simpler with the device. Uh i it has different blocks  different blocks. Uh first is remote control have sh ha should have some electric circuits uh making interface with uh keyboard and uh r reading uh keyboard and reading the keyboard uh commands. And then inter then make uh these keyboard commands  uh in interpret these int uh keyboard commands. And then there should be uh an electronic circuit making uh electronic signals according to these commands and uh finally there is a transmitter which is a cord or a a diode making uh making uh waves to transmit through the air and uh uh this air this uh wave uh will be received by the by the other device like a television or whatever  to uh r to realise the command. Okay  uh about what I found about uh different uh these different blocks are uh  usually there are two different methods uh to for designing a remote control. They are based on infra-red uh waves or uh uh radio waves. There are two different uh uh solutions I mean. This is uh this can be uh uh the the differences the th between different kind of waves  infra-red or radio waves. And uh also as uh I understood  and uh I think it was a part of uh Bob  uh uh presentation  people prefer to have uh to have uh the remote control with less button. So for the electronic part  working and interfacing  with button  we should we should try to t try to design a remote control having uh some some simpler buttons or some rolling buttons to just to just to search between different options  and showing o something on T_V_ and putting less lesser stuff on the uh on the remote control. And uh personal preferences  uh uh uh uh certainly a remote control with uh working with radio waves is uh preferred because uh you can pr you can take it in any direction and you don't need to tune it any way. And uh uh again  using bigger buttons and less number of buttons are also preferred  as I see. Okay. That was my presentation. Uh-huh. Uh  I don't think so  because uh we can make uh we ca we can make this wave in a specific frequency. So they can be in a range which is not inter interfering with the with other devices inside the home. Uh no but as I know  there is a range for uh for this uh f for for uh for this stuff  for designing this circuit. We can we can we can tune our uh transmitter to work in this range  and for this range we don't need to ask any permission. Uh for this I'm not uh I I don't know the solution  but one solution can be something like putting uh p password or something inside the wave  so the only your T_V_ can understand it Yeah  identification code inside the The password may simply uh or uh i identification code may simply solve this problem. A specific uh remote control has a specific f Mm. Mm-hmm. Five. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yes. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. Yeah yeah  at least nine  ten button. Or Or something. Mm-hmm. Okay. Like categorising channels. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. So uh we don't have any uh we don't have uh we should just design the remote control and we sh we don't have any access to the to the T_V_ design or we can change some design. Because one solution for this um uh uh ch changing channels is to see a summary of all channels  some some preview of all channels and then you can Yeah. Yeah b Not on the control  on the screen  on the T_V_ screen. And then Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Settings. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah  they can yeah they can be hide somewhere by a cover or something like this. Like covering cu. Yeah  like mobile phone covering. A button is better. Yeah. Mm. Clock or Yes. Mm. Mm. Yes. Mm. And uh do we need to include anything about the speech recognition and the speech commands  or? I I thin I think it will not take lots of place  we just need a microphone and the software  so  and it sh and it will be a little bit new and interesting  so people may be attracted to buy this stuff and it's not very difficult to uh put a software inside the the electronic device and put a microphone. It doesn't take that much place and also that much It doesn't cost that much. Mm-hmm. Thanks. Yeah  that's it. Well  okay  yeah. Yeah  but the user user interface is responsible. Okay  so. You're scaring me with L_C_D_ man. And speech recognition in remote unit  it will be very e expensive. Yeah. Yeah. At least we have couple of months t to work on it so so it will be cheaper finally. Because you cancelled it. Yeah. Yep. You still want me the presentation. Yeah  it should be okay. Yeah f uh I know about this  since it's my it's exactly my field  so. It's uh kind of handshaking  uh  when starting to uh when you start to communicate with the your T_V_ then then it's like an handshaking protocol with your your remote. So so if two two devices are trying to go to communicate with the T_V_ set then the the the one which has the more energy in the wave is chosen. Well it can be a problem sometimes  but most of the time it works okay. Yeah but we we don't have to think uh about this because I think as a function designer that we will use the already made uh circuits which we probably bu buy. It's worth to buy. And they have these problems solved so. So we don't have to think about these. Yes. I have only a couple of things because I had I struggled a bit with the software that I'm supposed to use in this uh uh in this company. I was used to use Linux before  so. But I tried to tried to break through this too  I guess. Mm. Ah. Okay. How to make it big? Slide show. Okay  thanks. Okay. Oh so I will speak about working design. That's the first slide. Uh what uh I have to do? A look at what the other company Okay so uh presently I am looking what is possible to use  what circuits to use and stuff like that because uh I didn't work uh with these uh circuits so far so I have to look what what is a v a v available on the market for for the communication for the I_R_ circuits and so on  so I'm currently looking what is available on the web. And uh I wanted to ask you m maybe afterwards  after after our discussion  if we have some contacts in some companies  so  which can report on what is going on there  so  I would be glad if you can tell me about them. So  you know. Uh  okay findings  that's the point that I'm working on currently but uh so far I I was uh looking what what are the blue circuit  I mean radio wave radio frequency circuits are available now  but the prices I read are high. So  I know that uh the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves because you can you can uh you can make the T_V_ do what you want even if you are in the bathroom or so on  but you know  when you are not close to the T_V_ you probably won't need to to change the program and so on and so I am I am voting for s to stick to the um infra-red control instead of R_W_ but we will discuss it later maybe. Uh. Components to use  I'm not exactly sure what I will use for the design of the circuit. It depends uh on whether we will use the L_C_D_ and mainly the speech recognition  because the speech rec Yeah? No no no no no. This we this we buy I think  because it's rather cheap nowadays and it's not worth to construct ourselves. Exactly. But I'm not sure about the circuit which is responsible for speech recognition. This I prefer that we should make ourselves. But it depends whether we take a decision to use it. Same thing. It's fairly expensive to use these circuits. So  speech recognition well  L_C_D_ it's okay because it's common nowadays to use L_C_D_  so I agree on using any kind of L_C_D_  less buttons good for me as a as a designer of the circuit. But the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the what does it offer  you know. Yeah  I'm Oh. I was not thinking too much about the price. But if we use the L_C_D_ uh even the radio frequency communication with the T_V_ set and the backlight and uh related things like the photo diodes and stuff  it should be okay. If we decide to use the speech recognition  then we probably could struggle but we'll see afterwards. It depends of you if if the M_E_ or U_I_D_  I'm sorry about the names  I don't really know  uh want to have it like in metal or in plastic  these things  it it depends on you not Because the the the electronic device's price is not not so big in comparison to to the overall shape and stuff like that  so. We will discuss it afterwards. Oh  this is nothing. This is just my notes on what to use. And uh my personal preference is yes  I would like also preferably to use R_W_ circuit  but from the point of view uh of the design and price  I would stick to I_R_s. That's my opinion. Uh I mean if infra-red uh circuit not not the radio frequency. Because because the the range where you can use it is fair. It's okay I think. And the price is fairly cheap for this. Well  depends. Jus just the price. Otherwise I don't care what I put there because it's the chip which I buy or which we buy. So I I I think it's o y o. Well  three to three to five. N not ten times  but it depends what what we Yeah. Th they are used to use it when they can see the T_V_ so  I don't know. You the user interface  and management man  uh Uh okay  that's it for me. 'Kay. I agree. Okay  so the available things are L_C_D_  the buttons and everything. Uh radio frequency depends. And  well the recognition it depends on you guys. You should probably speak. Okay. Uh just one note to the chan channel changing. Do we will we use only two buttons  or or like numbered buttons? I mean those nine plus one or two? Because it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number. Okay so so we keep all these all these buttons. Like ten plus  five plus  one plus  one minus or something. Or using the names and the keyboard I dunno. You mean like hierarchical structure. Okay  so s Oh sorry. So it requires the use of L_C_D_ probably  to to tell you Okay  so I'll make a note on L_C_D_. Yeah. Like roller for the Yeah. Okay. So we are still s speaking about the common devices or we are inviting the new one? On the screen  you mean? Not on the control  but on the screen. Well  this would avoid L_C_D_  then. Oh. W I I think it it would be better to to stick to the remote control and not to bother the T_V_ to to to print these things. Well it wi it will be still more expensive  but for the L_C_D_ and this stuff is no problem in the price. Two T_V_s. Like ma We we could have for example two buttons like simple mode and advanced mode. Or I dunno. Or like children and grandfather's mode  and the  well the the user not the user  the man mana T_V_ manager mode. Ah  I dunno. Uh. Yeah. Hide them  okay. Um. Yes. This I was thinking. Do we need a power button at all? Should should shouldn't we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it? Because generally Yes. Well I I uh You don't need to every five minutes to keep it alive. Uh probably. Okay  so we should keep this button. Okay  so we we could p what we could probably do is to keep also to keep uh keep the L_C_D_ and all the buttons and stuff  we could make it like a opening opening style that if you open it you are you just turn on the T_V_ and if you close it  it will turn off the T_V_. If if you like this  Because  well it's maybe question for you t Yeah. I mean like the Yeah but since we have the L_C_D_  we didn't need too much button too many buttons. Um  okay  just um the decision of the power button. Should we make it a button  or some some something which would be Uh power button. If it if it's a button or Okay. Okay  one nice big button. Old fashioned button  to satisfy the grandmothers. Hmm. Mm. Do we still have the time? I I just wonder. Okay. Oh. Well what w what was the question? Yeah but since we want to control all the televisions  and and it would probably be worth to to set the timing on the remote  no? Because if if the T_V_ turns on itself  it well you know  if the time The timer should be there. Ah  yeah. Did you did you ever use the like the timing of turning on the T_V_  well And based on your Yeah but it can be on the display in in a corner all the time on the remote. Yes yes. Yeah but we we should be careful about the battery life  then. If we use the speech recognition. Yeah. So um nice to see you again. Uh. So  uh. Tod uh for this meeting I will take the notes and do the minutes. Uh so we will see our three presentations. Um we will start with the uh Manager Expert wi who will talk about uh user re requirements  whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device. Yep. Oh  I don't think so. I think you have to come here. I dunno. I think it should stay. Should stay in the square here. Oh  maybe. Oh  you can put it here. Oh that's okay  it's jus Hmm. Thank you. So  um maybe now we can talk about a user interface and uh about the technical function of this device. So uh Pet Peter  can you talk say something about that? No. Ah. Sorry  I'm Sorry. Sorry. Yeah  it's still Bob Morris. Yeah you should have put yes. Click on yes. yeah. So can we use any any frequency? We have the right to use any frequency? Okay. And what happen with uh radio waves when two neighbours have the same have our remote control  for example? And so do they have the same frequency  or? Okay. A kind of identification  okay. So Yeah. So Okay. Hmm. Okay. So  maybe you can talk about the function  and Open. Slide show. It should work  so you can. Mm. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. So what do you think would be the price  it would be out of range? Or it would be maybe feasible? Okay. Mm. Why? Because it's simpler? Yeah. Mm. Okay. It's a a price matter. Yeah. Mm. Okay. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Well I  oh On the other side  we want to have something new. You know  where we want to to have something new and So we I think we should still thinking about it. But maybe. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay  thank you Peter. So um I have to inform you I receive an email from the management bon board today and they have new requirements for the for the remote control. Um first um  they say that's uh about something about t teletext. Uh apparently it becomes from according to them it becomes out of date. Out-dated. And uh Because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home  and actually it's not useful to have teletext. Um. So I think we can avoid the teletext. Um the second thing is uh they suggest that that we should uh use the remote control only for T_V_  not for D_V_D_ and other devices  because it make it it makes it's too complex and uh because we have not much time for this project we should stay on T_V_ on the only specific T_V_ remote control. The third the third one is uh about the the the image of the company. So um uh we should we should keep uh The the product should be recognisable. Uh  uh It's That mean we should use the colour of our company and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company  which is uh  we put fashion of in electronics. So  when people see the the remote control  they should say oh it's from Real Reaction and he s they should recognise the company. So  um So now we we should take the decision what we are going to what function we will have on this uh on this remote control. So  mm  are we going to use L_C_D_  speech recognition? Uh. Yeah. Maybe  maybe. Yeah but first maybe what is what are the usual function of a standard remote control? I mean what do Yeah. Yeah. I think we should stick on very useful functions  because we want less button. So  yeah. So  turning channel  of course. Volume setting. Yeah. I think it would be a b Yeah. On the other side we have more and more channels  and if you want to pass through all the channels to get the channel you want  it's Maybe maybe we could think of something more betweens  like uh Yeah. Maybe something like that. Uh. Maybe Oh I don't know. Oh. Maybe we could have key buttons  like uh discovery channe like documentary channel  and movies channel and And inside this this thing you can move  maybe switch. If you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you've you plus plus plus. I It just an idea. I don't know what you think about that but. Yeah  probably  yeah  yeah. Okay. Anything else? Yeah. Yeah. What about the settings of the T_V_? Because it's button we don't use very often  but it's we need it anyway. So Yeah  yeah. I don't know if it's possible to to watch something on T_V_ Yeah. Yeah. So  what are we doing with the settings? Because settings if we want to do settings we need buttons for that and we want less buttons  so. Maybe with the L_C_D_ we can do something with less buttons  but Mm. Yeah. Oh yeah. Oh  the. Yeah. Yeah. We should hide them somewhere. In the menus of the L_C_D_ or in the back of the remote control  or something like that. It's it's a kind of setting  I think. It should fit in those settings functions. Because it's not a very current useful function. No  I think it's after after five minutes or something a timer I I think  no? Oh okay  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So s yeah. Yeah. On the back  or For what? Ah oh yeah  yeah. Yeah a button  yeah I guess so. So  any other suggestions or functions? Yeah  we have still one or two minutes to talk  yeah. Usually it's already on T_V_ or something like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If we if we add the time  we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that  and is it very useful? I mean  are users wants to have the time on the on the remote? This is the question. Is it useful? W In my opinion we should have only useful thing and Because apparently they want The simpler it's is better. No time on. I think Yeah. So maybe we think we can think more about that  and discuss that maybe last time next time. And uh yeah  now the meeting room is busy. Somebody booked the meeting room just for at one P_M_  and so we should leave. Uh. So  um. So now we are going for for a small lunch. It's uh funded by the company. And uh after we have uh thirteen minutes to to do indevel individual works. And uh I will do the minutes. And uh you are going to work on your individual works. And uh you will receive as usual your specific instruction and so on. Thank you everybody. ,The group introduced themselves and their roles to each other. The Project Manager introduced the project aim and agenda to the group. The group acquainted themselves with the meeting-room equipment by drawing on the whiteboard. The Project Manager discussed the projected production cost and price point for the device. The group began a discussion about their own experiences with using remote controls and about usability features to be included in the design. The Project Manager instructed the Industrial Designer to prepare the working design  the User Interface Designer to research technical functions  and the Marketing Expert to prepare the user requirement specification. The group discussed the function of the prototype and decided that they should restrict the remote to television for the time being. 
So in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the for the remote control. So. So let's see the what did you prepare. Sh share folder for th your presentation? Because I have here Okay just one. Why you why you you put it in the the side? It's not a good place maybe. Oh it's very costly  microphone array. How much does it cost this one? Fifteen dollars? Ah it's above it's above the budget. How many b battery is there? Battery. So one one battery? It's kinetic reserve. Mm. I think it's not a good idea because after maybe one or two months of function is getting destroyed. If you Mm-hmm. No four dollars  it's good. And we will we will serve the charger with this? With the remote control. Okay so the price of the charger included in the Mm-hmm. The price should be below twelve and a half Euro. Well that's so We have we have just The price of selling is twenty five Euros. And the price of production That's for this basis function and if you want more you pay more. Yeah. Okay. But Mm-hmm. Titanium. What what's Maybe yeah. What's the price to p to produce? With with with the charge? Okay. We don't have charger. We don't have all the options. Charger we don't have charger here either. No it's it's below the the the budget. It's below the bu the budget. We Yeah. You. And you? Mm-hmm. Uh For L_C_D_. Without L_C_D_. Uh no innovative yeah. So let's remove it. But This is the problem. No it's just if I I see the the f the rate I think it's better to do it without L_C_D_. Because that's with L_C_D_ just will increase the price  and I thi i they have the same rate so without L_C_D_ it will be Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Without L_C_D_. Yeah. What a what what about the sys speech recognition? what about the integration of speech recognition? Ah so it's optional with the okay. I think it will be I think i I think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control  because maybe parents will lose these uh Yeah. Or ma yeah. Or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or  so mayb better if you have all this in the same Yeah. So you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional uh will be optional. Uh I think it inc increase. I think it i increases. Hmm. And and we we we we we we don't want that. So Project evaluation project satisfaction  for example. I don't know  we have to ask these question. We have to give answers so Project evaluation. Mm-hmm. Yeah I think so. He gave you the liberty to talk as you wants. Uh the teamwork was very very good. I was really I am very satisfying to work with with you. Oh. Less fancy. De Without without L_C_D_  without speech recognition  it will be simple. Yeah free free coffee. Yeah thank you for your work and Okay. Yeah  so can you go out to the shared folder? Mm the shared folder. Yes. We have a presentation. Uh So I got the participant uh three. W uh. Three. It's the final design  yeah. S so so I discussed with Guillaume. Right. And uh so we have and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes  because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an L_C_D_ or not because it's too expensive. So we come up with two versions. One with and one without L_C_D_s. Um but both comes with a charger and then detachable and uh or control module. And detachable big buttons for all people um. So. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. No i i it's the all around camer uh microphone isn't it. The the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere. Yeah Mm. Yeah yeah. For the Yeah. Mm. Hmm. Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it. A_A_ rechargeable batteries. Yeah rechargeable batteries. We have the charger so it's no problem. Actually uh it's a flexible thing. You just n uh Yeah yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. At uh yeah. I forgot to tell you there is only a single button there  b this button yeah alright. This button is like the mouse is like a joystick  you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction so you can make a turn and it the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click all in a single button. You can move up  down  left  right  or you can do a swing. So a swing to the left  a swing to the right defines other functions. So even though it's a single button  but it is pretty s flexible because of the three hundred and sixty degree movement. Yeah. This is the version y that comes with L_C_D_. Here I present another version without the L_C_D_. Mm. Uh okay this is new prototype uh. Yeah yeah. Mm. Oh no th actually th we'll come to that point in our Yeah. W w I'll I'll come to that point later on. Yeah. Th they either these with the uh the the charger any in either versions you they they ha they use the same charger yeah. Uh it's a standard module so you should get it for a cheap price uh. It's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone but uh again depends on the types. I think we have to investigate more on that  but Yeah. Yeah but as the Marketing Manager says  people is willing to people are willing to pay more for good design. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah we'll we'll come up to that  the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more. If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system  so is uh modular. Yeah yeah  for example the L_C_D_  you can take it you can put it put it back in  or you can use the other one  or the speech recogniser with the microphone yeah yeah. You want a microphone to put in the speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see. So It's pretty flexible in the yeah price. Uh yeah yeah you should present that. Yeah. Yeah Mm. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah the i the idea the the conceptual idea is that simplicity and powerful. Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons  powerful is that all the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n but here you only have few buttons but you retain the mm the same powerful functionalities. But in addition with simplicity. So that's the best idea  the cond that that's our uh an innovation um uh i in this uh design here. Okay now we come to other important features that I did not tell you. The first one is the speech recogniser  again it's detachable or add-on. And then we also have security feature for example this here oop it's very robust  it doesn't break and the material  what's the material again? Titanium material. Again uh and the battery life is uh is an is an endurable one  again because this is A_A_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want. Lithium-ion may be a good one  but you can replace it with cheaper one  again you pay for what you get  and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder. So when you finish watching your T_V_ and you the you t you turn off the T_V_  uh and then there's this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger  so so that's the or is it that's the reminder part. Yeah and um And it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary  so we didn't define the vocabulary so it's up to the user to define so sorry? And then uh because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a of T_V_ programmes by genre  and this can be used by the adult or by the children. So instead of choosing the channel you are choosing the T_V_ contents of the night. So it's pretty powerful  and that's that's why the num buttons are reduced  because of this feature. Yeah. And and for the materials that is cheap to produce I think uh it's quite clear from yeah. And also like the and the fancy designs yeah. Maybe we can improve more on the design but uh this is the Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Spongy spongy. Mm mm. Mm mm. But the the problem is that uh is it robust to mishandling? We have you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy. Spongy. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. So so is the e evaluation depending on us or other users? Yeah. But who will give the scoring uh we ourself or or a third party? Mm. Mm. Mm. I think we can improve on the design. Som someone um commented this is like a the stone age uh design. Um we have been focused all all this time on the on the technical aspect  functional aspect  but also the simplicity. As for the design maybe we c should hire a designer to help. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah from the innovation aspect I feel that uh what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that um the retrieval of T_V_ programmes by content  because uh that is really innovative  and for now and another innovation we have is simplicity and simplicity  few buttons  we've uh A lot of functionalities. So that is uh that is uh for both th Our gi I think that the our our product is uh has the best in all well this is a biased judgement because we designed them. Yeah. Uh the innovation is v is very high I think. Both. For both. It's the same innovation. So maybe I can put six to seven. Both. Mm. Uh uh uh there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the L_C_D_? We haven't really uh determined what are actually actually it's good to have a L_C_D_ but what are we gonna display on a L_C_D_? Yeah? Yeah. Yeah but Yes exactly. But you cannot display all on a L_C_D_. Anyway for for the users who who who opt for L_C_D_ we'll give them the give them the L_C_D_  we give what the customer uh wants  right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah I think sorry. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. S Yeah. I have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect. I think the easy to use uh aspect is different for different people. For the young generation easy to use may be very complicated because uh they w they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons. For kids they want simply the s similarit for the old people they want simplicity  so that's why we have the parental module. Uh we can ha have build a more complex design if if they want it  but but uh what I'm trying to say here is that the um we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people. So in terms of easy to use I think it's very user customisable. User customisation is very important yeah. Yeah so W uh I think it's the same. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. To improve on the design. Huh? The speech recogniser is a add-on module. Right? Yeah. Oh. The problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component  and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people  and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them. So we might lose the customer because of this. I don't know  what do you think uh? Yes exa what do you think  I don't know. You are Marketing Manag. Yeah. Yeah. But the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost? Mm. Mm. Yeah. Well well the other aspect is that if in the when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the you're gonna keep the same customer  because the same customer will come back to buy other add-ons. So so Yeah i i so if don't don't buy now they can buy i in the future. So in in that way you're actually keeping the cus the same customer  attracting them to come back in again and again. We're not trying to follow the Microsoft and we don't want to the m Yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be can be upgraded  it would be a good thing right? Yeah  it depends on the v production. Mm. Mm. Yeah. What we can change is to propose the customers with skins. For example the i the mobile phones nowaday  they sell different kinds of skin and then people just feel that oh I have a new skin and looks better. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah you can pl in what material would that be in uh? Yeah or furry like a pet dog kind of thing. I suppose that you this criteria  is it? Room for creativity. This room is a bit small  but but I think it's okay for us to work with. Yeah mm. Mm. Yeah anyway we have the laboratory nearby to build our modules so it's okay. Good job good job. Thank you. Alright. Mm. Mm we I I know something  we need more cakes  more biscuits on the table while we have meetings. Mm. Mm. Alright then  we finished? Thank you very much. Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. The cost would be le reduced. Is that two or one? Now what is the whole day rating for that? Whole day's rating. What type of battery? Something like a two A_  A_ three size batteries? Mm-hmm. And the L_C_D_ is this one  on the remote? Yeah. Uh-huh and also the switch. Okay. Mm-hmm. And I think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger  because that's a major that's a Okay and if you disable speech recognition system then? Mm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm. Okay. Yeah people are willing to pay more  but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment. Or uh Something like customised. Yeah. Mm hmm hmm hmm. Hmm okay. And this is other one? Mm hmm hmm hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah that's fine. Okay. Mm hmm hmm hmm. With the charger? I think we can use Excel. Yeah it's a nice input but we have an other inputs from the l public demands. I think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements  and we can finalise the product based on this discu I think we can just go to my presentation then. We can wind up. Or we could uh come to some f uh final conclusions. So the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings  and uh in the market the people are not really interested with L_C_D_  without L_C_D_  with speech recognition interface  or without speech recognition interface  but most of the people what they are interested is first thing is  they want to have an fancy look and feel  it should be very fancy with colourful and uh very handy to hold. And the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative. Of course in that we could put L_C_D_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative. And the third one is easy to use. Okay and if we go to the next slide  here you can find these are the latest fashion updates  and so this in Paris and Milan they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable  so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable  or whatever they like. So I think it should be much more customised to make a different uh shapes. And the second thing is  and if the material  they really do not want it to be very hard  as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium  it should be somewhat spongy. Um. Yeah so uh so finally we have these three criterias. One is fancy look  second is innovative  and third is easy to use. So these are the f uh three criteria on which we are going to build our remote. So and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these  say that we have a seven point scale  from one to seven  and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this. So now you have with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_  so on this scale  if it is true  if it is if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one  or if it is false  it doesn't it looks uh it doesn't look much fancy  then you could just tell me seven. So We can make our study on this and No no we have you have designed two products now  one is with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_. According to you  no according to you designers  how will feel does it uh with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_? Okay let us make this L_ and without L_C_D_. On on this scale the L_C_D_ remote control. How do you look how does it look? D is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy? And you both agree for that? So I take three on with L_C_D_? So without L_C_D_ how would you rate it? Four. And in the sense of innovativeness  with L_C_D_. Five with L_C_D_ and So without L_C_D_? No no according to design aspect we want to know how would you feel the innovativeness? With L_C_D_. And without L_C_D_? Okay. No actually uh to make it with L_C_D_ you make more efforts. So I there is high innovativeness included if you make it with L_C_D_ y then when it is without L_C_D_ there is not much innovativeness. So we can't go I mean that what you are sayin that's what the design No it's like this  I mean on the L_C_D_  according to what I understand from your model is  you have a joystick here  and you have L_C_D_  you just press your joystick  you get here a programme. Uh then No on the T_V_ you don't it doesn't display on the T_V_ now. L_C_D_? Then uh there is no meaning in having it on the T_V_. Or then again you have a channels  volume and all the stuff and what a I mean that depends upon your design  so I mean So without L_C_D_ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness? And which do you recommend e easy to use  with L_C_D_ or without L_C_D_? Yeah. Or we can just go back to the previous slide uh where we ha we have a few updates. So I mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes according to fruit and vegetable or a spongy touch without L_C_D_ and without speech recognition. Even then our product is going to be very good. Yeah. Yeah that's right. Yeah yeah that's right. So without L_C_D_ I just take it five? Or you want it to be six? S s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_. As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without L_C_D_ it is going to reduce the cost also  and it's going to be much simpler to use. So. That's going to be an optional. If somebody wants to buy it they can have it  otherwise no. It's an optional. Yeah. Yeah  but I mean if you have an add-ons  the kids may just uh hide the parental module and so that their parents can't use it. In the same set  yeah  and and individual buttons to make them work. I mean how to how to how to make a marketing survey that uh how many married couple or how many couples have a T_V_ or to the number or singles who have a television. So based on that I think But you can make it on a single P_C_ with three different options. On the same P_C_B_ yeah yeah. Yeah that's right. I mean you could just provide with an optional. So it's something like a Microsoft product update. Updates and we sell it. We make updates and sell it. And uh what's the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls? Uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types? Do you require different types of P_C_B_s and Or uh it could be like this the P_C_B_ would be the same for all  but only the exterior uh shape is different o for all. Yeah  yeah that's right. Yeah that's right. I think you need to look into the material. Yeah yeah. I think the Project Manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models. I feel it's fine  we know we don't need uh I think it's okay. This is fine for making a presentat for project presentations. And the leadership was excellent. Yeah that's right. Yeah that's right. And new ideas found. Any new ideas to make these presentations more interactive and more interesting? I mean uh what type of product would you think could we make this more interesting? Yeah that is within the budget. And the evaluation was Yeah that's right. And the next is celebration. So Yeah thank you  thank you very much. Mm. Yeah. S okay so I'll show you the the two prototypes. Here we have the first one with the beautiful uh L_C_D_ um display. You you can s here. And you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by uh joystick joystick-like uh button. You can uh choose the direction and if you just push on it it's considered like a enter function. You have on the mm on the side here the microphone for the for the speech recognition system here. And here the the switch that control if you want Well I I I think uh it's the Yeah but Yeah. Well so it's a microphone array. No it's just a single microphone  and you I I think uh we we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your L_C_D_ you will be close to well it's better to to to place it here th than here  for instance. And here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker uh recognition system to um to be on or off. And uh so this remote control comes up with its charger. Well this this prototype is um made for about uh well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars fifteen dollars  but uh well it's not it's not uh yeah  but uh it's just a prototype and if we uh if we optimises the um the uh voila. Yeah the and the the production costs we we can achieve uh about ten dollars. How many  excuse me? Well uh f battery  we use uh about uh Yeah. Rechargeable of course  because we have the charger. Yeah and you just On uh yeah one battery. The excuse me? Oh yeah it's just a r uh simple battery a rechargeable uh if you uh like it's exist. Yeah. So and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger and uh leave it uh alone  it's alright. Then the next time you pick it  oh it works. Yeah just explain the button uh Norman. Yep. Yeah it's So we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration. The second version is also simpler  we d uh we had just uh I have to put the microphone also. So basically th it's the same uh yeah. Basically it's the same uh things uh uh as uh I presented before. But here we have uh we have uh four buttons for navigation. Press one button uh acting as a a enter button. So um yeah according to what you said it's more robust to the user. And uh it's also cheaper to produce. We can produce uh such remote control for about uh four dollars. Yeah it's it's it's embed in the uh speech recognition system. So so Norman will explain to you. Yeah yeah of course mm. Thank thank you. And so mm-hmm. Alright please uh go on Norman with the special features. You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control that that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do  and uh which channel you want to choose and so on. H here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch T_V_  up they come up with their modules  they just plug in it and they can have all the control they want here. We also have this module for uh old people with big buttons  clearly labelled  and it acts like the previous one  you just plug in and it works. The titanium and so it's very uh Well so the price to produce For uh the simplest one  say we start from four dollars to produce such a device. Uh it's about it The without without the charger it's about uh well two dollars to produce uh the microphone and speech recognition systems. Two dollars for the uh for the add-on modules  and finally three dollars for the charger. So if you uh sum up uh everything wi with the L_C_D_  which costs two dollar  you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two. It's about so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about uh fifteen dollars. But it's just if you want all functionalities. Excuse me? Yeah. Well I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the T_V_ screen uh uh with just four buttons. Okay. A sponge. Hmm. Yeah. Well it doesn't look much fancy I'll I'll say three or four. Yeah. It's it it Technical aspects. Yeah a three. Uh four. I think it's it's uh more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated so removing the L_C_D_ um gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look. Well it's it's the same for both so I will give a five  six. Well five also uh Norman please. With lot of functionalities. Mm for both it's the the same innovations. six  let's go for six. Yeah. Talk about Yeah but you have the same programme on the T_V_ screen. If you have the L_C_D_  but if n Yeah. Yeah. Well I think both are really easy to use because there are few button buttons  and uh well t p the menu are clear  well-organised  so Well with little knowing of the technology you can you can easily use the product so I will give a six for the easy to use. Yeah  it's cheaper to produce. And uh if the the well if we have less technology we have more liberty to uh for the shape and uh things like that so Yep. Yeah. Six. Um six. Yes as you say  with better uh yeah. And to improve the the look. Yes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look so so let's go back to our laboratory and Yeah. It's optional yeah  since well according to this study uh people more likes more to have a spongy uh remote control than Yeah. Well it's about the same because if Well you can if you had uh something li Oh no  because if you if you add uh something well yeah maybe because it's three different pieces uh to to to build but Yeah yeah yeah it's I think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the functionalities um on the same module  but uh Yeah. Yeah. Well so Yeah yeah I think we are yeah but we are also the um well the components will have to change because uh we have to deal with the shape and um but I don't think it will uh increase the cost too much so Uh well but it's a bit complicated to if if if you need machines to different machines to um ah well Yeah yeah we can have the same global shape and then uh add on skins and with with this uh tex spongy texture uh things like that. Sponge. Okay. So we finished the prototype uh presentation if you have uh something else to say. That was good. Yeah. Fine yes uh. Very democratic. Thank you. Alright. Come up with new product. Yeah and also more well uh more seriously I think it's it's a good idea to have uh clear clear points whenever we do a meeting uh prior to the meeting to have uh well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that  but I think it's alright. We achieved uh project goal I think. It's w yes  more or less. Yeah but Alright. So. So uh coffee machine. Okay. ,There are some new requirements for the project: the device will have to be for TV only  they should ignore the teletext function  as it is dated  and  also  the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product. The target group will be people below 30. It transpires that customers are willing to pay more for fancier looking remotes  especially if they include LCD screens and speech recognition. Functions like zapping are very prevalent  as well as complaints about remotes being difficult to learn and easy to lose. The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip  and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared. The team agreed to follow a user-centred approach and simplify the design by somehow minimising the number of buttons. They plan to include an LCD screen to display relevant information. Other functions are served by push buttons: OK  menu  screen sizing  AV  settings buttons  mute  digits 1-9  power  volume control  channel up/down with the last three types being prominent on the device. The exact design and placement of the components will be decided in the next meeting. 
Yeah. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Should be just loading. Okay. Oh  although I can't see it on my screen. That says go here. Okay. I've been doing some research into the different components that we could use  um what's available to us f to actually make the remote control. Um  first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made  and what is it happens inside the casing  which is more your field. Um  thes main internal feature is a circuit board  which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source. Which is not necessarily a battery  as we're about to see. Um  there are several components of  um  the circuit board that we need to consider  where we'll be getting them from  what they'll be made of. Um  including the integrated circuit  which is also known as the chip. Which is where all the main information is uh contained. Um  diodes  transistors  resonators  resistors  and capacit capacitors all need to be considered as well. Um  and all their positioning in the circuit. Uh  these  they're all different options  they're all separate  apart from the chip  which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple  a regular  advanced. We can go into that later. Um  all the other things are individual components that we'd have to get in separately  and work out the most  like  effective um circuit  including all the wires and everything like that. And the L_E_D_ of course  that's a light emitting diode. So  we could  so we've got flex flexibility with colours and things  with that as well. Okay  there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source. We could use a basic battery  but that brings with it  like they need to be recharged and the bulk  the size of it as well. And they're not so great to dispose of  environmentally. There's a hand-powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago. A bit out of date. Kinetic energy is something that's been recently developed. Um  where you manually charge up the power. Like you wind up something. Sorry? Yeah. Every once in a while I think. But it's Yeah. It would be like going a step back in time. I don't think it would really be with kind of cutting edge technology. Whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that's being used by some watches and other devices  where you just shake the device and it gives it power. I mean  the kinetic energy is transformed into power to make the circuit work. Um  or there's solar power  which we've been considering inside a building  which is where it's gonna be used  might not be quite so useful. But  good to look into  renewable energy  always the way. Um  lots of considerations for the case  like what sort of shape it would be  curved or flat. That's got a lot to do with the ergonomics. Like how it's comfortable and s sits in the hand. We don't want something that's huge and you can't pick up. Or too small. Or too slidy. I know I've had a remote control before which you couldn't tell which was the front and the back  'cause it had so many buttons on  and the shape was so symmetrical that I'd be pressing like a volume button instead of the on button. Because you can't really see which way round it is. Um  we also can choose what materials um  the we could use metal  we could use rubber which might be more um ideal for the anti-R_S_I_. It's like the same sort of rubber that's used in stress balls and things like that  so it's very like soft  not so stressful on your hands. Wood. Um  again  stepping back in time again there. I don't think that's quite up to date with what we're looking for here. Um  titanium is not gonna be possible  even though it just it beyond our budget really. But  would've been maybe for future projects. Um right our choice for buttons as well. We've developed some we've got some good advances in technology  with our research team have found some uh new multiple um option scroll buttons. I think that was brought up for  um  they're basically quite a flexible design  modern  you don't have to use individual buttons. You can just slide up and down. I'm sure we're all quite familiar with those on mobiles or computer laptop pads. Yeah. That's true. And that would lead to an advanced yeah. If we have yeah. We're going on to that later with the advanc with the L_C_D_ that means we'd need a really advanced chip. And it's unlikely that that's gonna be in our budget. Um  also we've got the integrated pushbutton  which is what we're most familiar with. It's the most straightforward. But you can in like incorporate that with a scroll button as well.. Got decisions to make there. And this is what I was just saying before. Linked in the different depends on what type of buttons we have and the inputs. Um simple would go with the pushbutton. Um  regular you could link with the scroll button. And the advanced we'd have to go with a L_C_D_ s display. My personal preferences? I think we could go for the kinetic energy source. I don't  I think that's quite um an advanced kind of technology. It's not been seen before  so it could be quite a  a novelty factor  attractive as well. And also energy saving 'cause you're producing the energy  you don't need an external sort of battery supply or solar panels. You just give it a shake. Sounds brilliant to me. Rubber casing I thing would probably the best  if we're going for the anti-R_S_I_ and like more choice with um aesthetics. Like it could be pretty much any colour we want. Um  and gives you  yeah  more flexibility there. And probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple  then we could possibly have the scroll and the push  but no L_C_D_  'cause we probably can't afford that one. Mm-hmm. I think that would  uh there would be an in sort of more internal casing. And the rubber would just be the  what's in contact with the human. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe if the  um  if it was just kind of a  more of a rubber coating which was on to a case. So  it was kind of  the whole thing would be removable. Yeah. Like I can't think of what. Yeah. Or like an you can get sort of outer casing for iPods and something  that's just it's protective as well. It  it stops it  I mean  it would reduce the impact if it was dropped or something  as well  'cause it wouldn't damage itself so easily. I think i maybe a mixture of both there  maybe. Yeah. And then yeah. Yeah. Yeah. As far as I know. It should be. Yeah. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. I thought that was Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like as a backup for something. Yeah. Yeah. Some alternative just in case something went wrong. That's true. I just thought of that. Yeah. Yeah. May maybe that could be the backup. Instead of a battery. Like solar backup. Yeah. I suppose s but some But thing is  it's not you don't need the solar all the time. It can be stored. It can be like you can have the solar energy and then it can store that energy and use it. It just needs to be in light for a certain amount of time per day. Like a few hours a day.. That's true. It could easily Yeah. I suppose it would be really annoying if you get to think  oh no  I forgot to charge my remote today. Like if the kinetic thing  I think what's best about that is that it's instant energy. You don't have to  you know  you can shake it a few times  or whatever. And it works. Yeah. Instead of you don't have to like make sure it's in the right place to charge and. K okay. Yeah. There we go. it wasn't on mine either. I don't know why. I think  I just  I just used the mouse on there. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. So I suppose sometime after you. Mm. I s I suppose where um mm on some buttons you would have like the power would be s some kind of symbol. And if you wanted to go onto teletext or  I know we're not having that  but I mean a similar thing  you  they have there's a like little picture with a screen with lines across it  which I suppose it's that sort of thing like the  the symbol on the button. But if we're having a simplified display anyway  w that  we probably won't have to focus so much on that. It'll be more the on the numbers and the volume. I suppose we need to think of symbols for like the volume  display  and stuff like that. I For inp Mm. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. That's in like the buttons with all the different like colours for different choices and things. It can be a bit  yeah  overwhelming. Yep. Oh. I'd assume  like  an internal light  that comes through. So there would have to  have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons  or something. Yeah  yeah. It should be able to mm-hmm. Li yeah. Mm-hmm. I think it would be possible. I don't think it would make that much difference. I mean  the uh the dimensions of it. 'Cause if it's just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of a mobile phone. You can like take off the hard cover and then there's the like say the buttons. And then you get to the circuit. I don't think it would matter that the buttons were bigger through the  the top casing. I'm sure you could f work it out to fit in the casing  without causing too much difficulty. I'm sure that'd be fine. Okay. You're not plugged in yet. Mm. It is strange. Well We I think we possibly could take a more abstract design. Like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables. And then just really like strip it down to like really basic shapes. I mean we don't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry  but it could have the curves of a strawberry  or something. Or a strawberry seed or a leaf. Or just like you know really make it a quite abstract  if that's fits in more with what we're doing. Instead of fruits and vegetables  just if you look at it straightforward  it's a bit yeah. It doesn't s quite fit in with the trendy well  obviously it does  if that's the current theme. But may maybe we could go more directly  I don't know. But initially  I dunno. I think if we just sort of tone it down a bit. Yeah and like not  not yeah. Mm. Yeah. I didn't for the first one. But I have now. Yeah. Uh  hopefully. Project documents I think. Okay. 'Kay. Kinetic yeah. Are we going to have a backup? Or do we just I think maybe we could just go for the kinetic energy  and be bold and innovative  and hope this works  and well hope that it works. I think yeah. I think no. I  I think we should just like take uh advantage of like using this to its full potential. Go for it. It could be fully kinetic energy. Yeah. Is everyone happy with that? Yeah. Um  it was whether we went for the simple  the regular  or the advanced chip. And that linked in with what buttons we would gonna have  so Yeah  it was so that was without the L_C_D_. So that means we're not doing the advanced. So it depends on whether we wanted the scroll buttons or just the push buttons. Uh  so that's the simple. Yeah possibly. So  it's probably gonna be the regular chip that we're going to need. So it's a medium. So regular chip. Regular sorry. Regular chip. Lighting. Yeah if we because of the lighting that we've decided to put in as well. So th I think this is just like gonna be the a very outer case  which we will decide on rubber. Rubber. Yeah. Plastic rubber coat. Interchangeable  yeah. Still going for that. Yeah. Your screen? Was it Ouch. The power. Volume. May yeah. Tone  contrast  and things. That's a bit Yeah  it was minima well  it wasn't the l Yeah. That would be good. Yeah  and surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television  so Mm. I think most of that comes like on the i individual television set itself  doesn't it? I'm sure it has its own buttons  so you don't necessarily need to have it on remote. Yeah. So we're just going for power  channels  volume  Mm. I've Yeah  that's it. We can just go for  make it a selling point that it is just the basic. Yeah uh I brilliant. Mm-hmm. Okay. Um  I just have one question about the whole fruit and vegetable aspect. Are we seeing as that was the most popular thing that came up out of your market research  I thi I think we should keep to that rather than moving to animals or something  because even if that may not seem obvious to us  if that's what the surveys brought out  I think that we should probably go along with that. Um  so I suppose that'll come out in our dev design development. But you're happy to go ahead with the fruit and veg? Y Yeah. We can have a look at those ideas  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Tricky. A lot of things to consider. Hm. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. W Like plastic with rubber  kind of on top Well  there's  there is a certain phone that has like a rubber casing  b like a Nokia it is. It's yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  tha Backup. Yeah. That would be good yeah. Maybe we could you were saying about um solar power ma maybe not working indoors  but a lot of calculators  yeah  have solar power. So maybe that could be incorporated as Yeah. Do  do those calculators yeah. I don't know how it works. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  I suppose. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks. Oh. It's not on my screen. Why? You don't know why? Oh okay. Is it that one? Um  I'm just gonna go through the interface concept with yous now. Uh  first of all I'll explain what a user interface is. It's the aspects of a computer system which can be seen or otherwise perceived  for example  heard or felt maybe  or by the human user. And it's also the commands that the user uses to control its operation and to input data. Um  there are two types of user interfaces. There's the graphical user interface  which emphasises the use of pictures for output and a pointing device  for example a mouse for input control. So that's sort of like the scroll thing we were talking about. Yeah. I'm not really sure about the pictures that maybe that's on an L_C_D_ screen. Or maybe it's the the buttons or pictures or something. Do you think it's Yeah. Yeah. So you must  for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics. Like an L_C_D_ screen. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No I think it's to do with the actual symbols that are on the  that's on the buttons of the remote control  and per Well it could be a wee scroller thing  and something could come up on the screen. Yeah. But um I think we're gonna go with the command interface anyway  to make it more simplistic. But the  we could incorporate some of the graphical user um points  as in just to make it m um nicer to look at maybe. Like I can't think of an example  but Sort of like little pictures rather than Like a little sound. Instead of saying volume  like a little speaker or something. Yeah  something y Yeah m perha yeah. Yeah. Maybe. Um  the co uh we've decided that the command interface would be the most useful for a remote control. As it would be less complicated  and the controls would be more user-friendly. Um  the remote control would be cheaper to design  so that we'd have more money in the budget to  um  target the design area of the interface. You know  make it more trendy and original. We'll have more money if we keep it simple. Yeah. Seeing as it's quite a new technology. Um We  we also have to keep in mind when we're designing our  um  more user-friendly remote control  that a lot of interfaces consist of a clutter of buttons  that  um  that their functions  colours and forms aren't always helpful. Yeah. Yeah. And that all interfaces are different. So  um  that doesn't improve the use of the produ product  so we need to come up with something that's easy to understand. And maybe learn from the mistakes of other interfaces that can be too complicated for people to use. Does anyone have any questions? Mm. But um Yeah. In the phone that I was thinking of as well  when you change the um covers of it  the  the little buttons that actually  you know  that contro control stuff  are behind the rubber. So you can change the buttons when you're changing the faces. Do you know what I mean? 'Cause it's just the wee control  yeah  thing that's behind it. So I mean  we don't have to decide on one colour. Each face could have its own colour of buttons maybe? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that's everything  then? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Or banana-shaped. Yeah. Where do you have to save it to? Okay. Just escape I think. Yeah. Yeah. Hope so. Yeah. Yeah. I don yeah. Yeah. It's for the lighting  yeah. Yeah. Yeah plastic coat. We decided on the component. I  I I'm sorry  I've lost my um PowerPoint thing  so I can't remember what it's ca it's the component The command inter The command line interface yeah. Yeah. Um  I think that is well we haven't really made any decisions about what we're gonna do about the cluster of button functions  colours and forms  in the in consistent use. Like what what are ideas to combat these problems? You know how um different interfaces are very different  and can be confusing because because of their difference  and because of the different clusters of buttons that they have. We haven't really decided what to do about that. Well it's just um w where where shall we locate the buttons. What kind of functions wi shall we have? So pretty just just the basic button functions. Yeah. Yeah  each television. You don't change that often  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It w it would seem silly if we'd having anything else  just have an audio button though. Do you know? But we Yeah. That could be a sales pitch. Simple and Yeah. Yeah. What I What I was thinking what do yous think of this? Um  having the numbers kind of like  not a bunch of grapes  but you know like purple and kind of in a triangle. Like grapes. Like that's kind of fruity or something. That's just Yeah. Okay. Yes. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Like the skin? Yeah. Okay. So the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casings rubber. Okay. And the buttons obviously are rubber. Okay. Mm-hmm. I guess it's a bit scary 'cause it hasn't been done before. So it seems we'd have to do more research on it. Or I dunno if you could have a battery pack. Yeah so there's there is a one battery  because most remotes use two batteries I believe. So  if it was running off of one battery as a Right. Although it needs some light  doesn't it? So  if we're doing yeah. If we're Yeah. Yeah. I think sometimes it's just shoved under  under a cushion  and yeah. Yeah. So it's just draf graphical for the pointing aspect? The infrared is like  that's considered a Okay. So when it says pointing device that doesn't include Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm. I think if we go with the um design plate thing  we'll have to. Just because of colour clashing  and if we wanted to  so and  and we might  I mean  depending on what comes out of the design  we might have to stick to just black buttons. You mean different colours for the lighting or Mm-hmm. Oh I see what you're saying. Well y Oh so you're picturing the light is coming from the back. I kinda pictured it as kind of coming from the sides and lighting it up frontwards. But  but I guess  you mean from the back. Okay. Okay. Right. Mm-hmm. Oh. Yeah. They  they insert over. Okay. T Okay is that my turn then? Alright. I have a shorter report for you today. Um  it took a while to get this  uh Uh. Oh. That's a very good point. Okay  so um  this report is about uh trend-watching. Um  basically so we can live up to our  our uh purpose of having a very fashionable remote control. Sorry. There we go. Um So  just so you know  my method was mainly web web-based research this time around. I also spoke with fashion experts in Milan  New York and Paris. And I looked at the design reports from previous years  here at Real Remote. Um  just so c we can work off of them  see how fashions have changed. Um  so I'll list the three most important aspects that I've come across. Um  and they  they're each more important than the one that comes after it. Uh  the first one is that there should be a fancy look-and-feel  instead of the current functional look-and-feel. Um  this should be our priority  as we've been saying. The second most important aspect is that a remote sh that the remote control should be technologically innovative. So  I think we've done a lot of talking about that  just with lighting and the buttons and the face-plates. Um  so it looks like we'll be able to keep on track with that. And the third most important aspect is that the remote control should be easy to use. So  pretty basic there. And the recent fashion update  uh  according to fashion-watchers in Paris and Milan  is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes  shoes and furniture. Um  also  in contra uh in contrast to last year  the feel of the material is expected to be spongy. Again  we've already discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic buttons. Um So  my personal preferences here  um of course  as we  we've already talked about the personal face-plates in this meeting  and I'd like to stick to that. The fruits and vegetable themes  I don't know if that's going to work for us. It sounds something that you'd use on kitchenware. I don't know if we wanna do it on remotes. It could be one of the options. Maybe for the television that people have in their kitchen. Um  the temporary light-up idea  sounds like we're gonna stick to that. And then  uh  tying in a trendy look with user-friendliness. Mm-hmm. It's  it's a little but it  it's everywhere. So maybe we I've seen a lot of purses with olives on them  you know. But I I think  I think if we stick to T_V_ based  you know  maybe T_V_ shows  or Or colour schemes. Right. Yeah. The The essence of strawberry. Yeah. I guess  yeah. One thing I was thinking though is I dunno if you all remember from our kickoff meeting  we talked about our favourite animals. So maybe there could be animal-based  you know. Because a lot of people have a house cat. Or  or a dog. Um  that might be getting  you know  too specific  and we should see what the success of the first face-plates are. But it's something to keep in mind. And  did you have any questions? Pretty straightforward? Okay. There you go. Have you guys been saving your PowerPoint presentations to the okay. The PowerPoint? So So if it's not working they just have to shake it a bit and that revitalises it? Okay. Mm-hmm. Oh  is regular not simple? Right right right. Think it was called command interface. Command interface . Mm-hmm. That was on  um one of my presentations. About how often it was used. Do you remember that? I w Should I bring it up? The ch t Screen settings was used um zero point five times an hour. So tw twice every once every two hours. Um  and it was considered a one point five relevance  on a scale of ten. That's brightness  colour  tone  all that. Mm-hmm. The other one was audio settings. Mono  stereo  pitch. I mean I sometimes use that. Some T_V_s will have the option of like living room style  movie style  um and that  they say that's used zero point eight times an hour  which is actually somewhat high. Like almost once an hour. Um  relevance of two. Well that didn't some up on mine. Oh. Yeah I guess that it affects the marketing  'cause it  mm it is a good sales ploy to say  aren't you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons. This one has channel  volume and your channe and your power. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Now do you guys need want an idea of how many uh are you gonna come up with casing ideas? Like f five different Mm-hmm. Yeah you can have some fun with the buttons  it's true. Yeah. I guess what you i ideally you'd kind of think of age markets as well. So it's a something that will  you know  appeal to the fifteen to twenty five year olds. Something that your granny would want on her remote control. Um  and international tastes as well  so Not easy. Okay. Is everyone ready to start? Okay. Great. Well  welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design. I'll just get the PowerPoint presentation up and running. Okay. Um  on the agenda for this  um  for this particular meeting  we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting  after we came up with um some general ideas of our design. And  um  then we have to make some key decisions on  on our remote control concept  and how we're gonna make it  what uh materials we're gonna use  and that sort of thing. The meeting will be forty minutes long. And um we will once again have Poppy as our first presenter. Alright  and I will switch up PowerPoint. Okay. Um Are they all included  like mandatorily  or r are these different options? Yeah. Mm. Um What is a hand-powered dynamo? Just every  every once in a while? Just every once in a while or constantly? Alright. It'd be kind of strange to always be cranking it I think. No. Right. Right. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Um one thing with the scroll buttons though. It  it we would have to have an L_C_D_ um display  and the glow in the dark thing might be difficult. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Uh. Yeah. Um  one concern with the rubber casing is that it would be rubber encapsulating all of these chips and diodes and delicate technology as like as the exterior. This is the one thing that's protecting its innards. Yeah. Another thing is it might be more difficult if it's a rubber exterior talking about putting on interchangeable plates. Um  is it I don't see how a like a rubber plate going on top it would stay there. Like if it was sort of like a clip-on plastic plate. It would work that way. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. So maybe the Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That sounds good. I  um  is it possible to put designs onto this type of rubber? Okay  we'll just say yeah. Yes  just why not. Alright. I like the kinetic energy source idea. Um  I don't know when people will  um  be moving a remote around a lot. But I think that it's worth it  kinetety  kinetic um energy source. It could make an we could have any kind of style. It wouldn't be as heavy or bulky  and Yeah. Just for environmental reasons. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  you can watch a T_V_ in the dark then. Yeah. I think that might be a little impractical though. Yeah. Like people don't wanna have to worry about that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Or just like pick it up when you're gonna use it. Yeah. Alright. Cool. 'S that the end of your presentation. Alright. Thank you. Yeah. That's um Oh. Okay. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Yeah  'cause I'm sorry? Um  because command interface requires you to type textual commands and input at a keyboard  so the numbers are sort of like a keyboard. You're pressing the numbers for  um  for what you want. Yeah  we'll be doing Yeah. It'd be more a command interface  and then Yeah. Hmm? Yeah. I think they're talking about L_C_D_ type things. Yeah. Yeah. What do you mean? Oh yeah  like how the buttons Yeah  as a button though. So  it's a keyboard in the shape of it  right? Okay. Yeah. I like that idea. Yeah. I'm sure i like kinetic energy would probably dip into the budget. A bit more too  yeah. Mm-hmm. Do you think that we should keep all the buttons to one same colour  just to keep it  give it a simplistic look. Yeah. Yeah. But what about the lighting up effect? Um  well  um  I thought we had um decided that we would if you touched one of the buttons they'd all light up. And so if they were black  it wouldn't be possible for them to light up. If they were white they would glow  probably. If they were made out of rubber. Oh. Where would the light come from? Yeah. Yeah  and well rubber is a more translucent product too  so we have that taken care of. Oh. Mm. Well  if they're raised up buttons. So that you can feel them. We were talking about it being more um  a lot more tangible. Um  it might be more difficult to do. If they're  if they're sticking up. If it's flat then  like o like on a cellphone or a mobile phone  it's like all very flat  and you just have to sort of press down on these tiny little buttons  but Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Alright. If it's do-able we can do. Yeah  sounds good to me. Alright  thank you. That means you're up. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah  it's the fruits and vegetables is the only area that I find rather jarring. Everything else we can really  we can really um  do  according to our plans already  given the market. But fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control. Yeah. Yeah. But they still need to um fit into people's decor though. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Tone it down. Yeah  like more like photos of fruit  on  on our product. Mm-hmm. Yeah um Alright  given that information  we need to start making some more specific decisions. So I'll need to um hook up the PowerPoint again. But it's still around right? Okay. Okay. I'm just trying to make this pop up now. Alright. Here we go. Okay so we have to uh decide now exactly what we are going to do. So energy  we oh. Oh no I can't write it in when it's in this setting. Does anyone know how to take it out of Um  yeah. Yeah. Okay. Um  so back to decisions. Energy  we've decided on kinetic  right? Okay  so that's good. Hmm. But would a backup really be necessary? I mean will people just use the battery if there's no  if there's  if there is backup. Yeah. Yeah. There's like no reason why it wouldn't work  right? Yeah. It could even be one of our selling points. Yeah. Yeah. Environmentally conscious or something. Yeah. Alright  the next um decision is chip on print. I don't exactly know what that means. Right  and we were going for more simplistic style  right? Yeah. I think we decided on the pushbuttons  right? Yeah. Would we need a more advanced one for uh the lighting  the interior lighting system? Yeah? Okay. That's called medium  or regular? 'Kay. Okay  and cases. Um  does this  is this dependent on shape  or what it's made of  or what? Yeah. Well  I guess plastic and coated in rubber. Plastic with rubber coating and interchangeable um yeah  interchangeable plates. Okay. User interface concept. This is your time to shine. Oh  yeah. Yeah. Command interface. Did you say command line? Okay. Line interface. Alright  and supplements. What's that all about? Um Mm-hmm. Um  what are our choices here? You mean like we'll have the numbers of the channels  and we'll have the channel-changer  and volume  and power? Um Yeah. Like I don't know if we should go into like adjusting light levels  things like that  because different televisions will have Um  yeah. Yep. Yeah  it was hardly ever used really. Yeah. And most televisions will come with a remote. Yeah. 'Kay  well we know we want numbers. Yeah  it does. Yeah  and different televisions. Like we  I don't know if we can make a remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of changes like that. Volume. Yeah. Oh. We have five minutes to finish our meeting. Crap. Okay  um  let's do this fast. Um Should we have audio? It only comes up on mine usually. Yeah  I don't  I it's  it's a problem with the international uh appeal  I think. Um  if we have audio because we don't know how other televisions work. But we know that everyone has this and it's the same. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Good. And  okay  in closing  'cause we only have five minutes. We'll be meeting again in thirty minutes. Um  you'll be working  Poppy will be working on the look-and-feel design. Wait a minute. Is that right? Yep  and um the user interface design  so this is where the trendy stuff comes in. And you'll be evaluating the product. Um  Poppy and Tara will have to work together  using modelling clay. And  um  your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen. Alright. So  anyone else have something to say? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. five.. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Lots of yeah. Alright. 'Kay we'll stick to the fruit and veggie theme then. Alright. And  um  we'll reconvene in thirty minutes. 'Kay. Bye. I'll see you later. Oh  what did I just do. Okay. ,The project manager stated that the goal for the current meeting was to decide upon a concept for the remote the team is creating. The marketing expert discussed his findings from trend watching reports. He found that current trends are such that a product must have a fancy look and feel  be technologically innovative  be easy to use  incorporate a fruit and vegetable motif  and must be spongy. The user interface designer discussed how to create an interface for a remote that is easy to use. The user interface designer discussed the placement of commonly used buttons  the overall shape of a remote  and how to hide less commonly used buttons. The industrial designer discussed various components and energy sources the remote could include. The industrial designer focused on the use of a TFT screen and the use of solar cells to supplement the energy from two regular batteries. The team then discussed and made decisions regarding the option to use solar cells  the specifications of an LCD screen  how to incorporate a fruit and vegetable motif into their design  and how to hide lesser used buttons. 
Hold that. Okay. Okay. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. I think for us it's just like a normal whiteboard  but they'll be recording what we write down. Mm. Mm. But for us it's just like a normal whiteboard. Mm-hmm. I have to draw. M my my favourite animal. Sorry this is all tangled up here. That's better. Mm-hmm. I'm a very bad drawer. Weird. Um. You're not gonna be able to guess from my drawing. I'm a bad drawer. Okay. They're ears  by the way. No. Um close though. Okay so like a pet animal. Like a cat. No  not a cat though. Okay. So. It's not a cat  it's a dog. Yes. It's got a tail then. Yeah yeah. So do cats. And you guessed cats without a tail. Okay. Okay  there you go. So what favourite characteristics. Uh. Dogs are always friendly and loyal and fun. A horse? This is why you're the designer. And I'm marketing. Ah Mm-hmm. That's it. A blue and black zebra. The very rare blue zebras. Yes. You got a lot of room here. You can probably reach. No? I took a dog. Um. A mouse? Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. It's a very big rat. Or a very small cat. Mm 'kay. Your turn. Ah I don't know what that is. It's a bit It's a bit hard to guess. Yeah. Mm-hmm Oh  it's a shark now. Mm. Now it's a swordfish. Swordfish. Um  maybe. I've never seen one  no. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yes. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. I'm marketing. Yep. Mm-hmm. Anna. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Oth yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. But we can't really design for something that hasn't been invented yet. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. But Ninety percent of the time  ninety nine percent of the time  people will be using the main functions  the volume  the different channels  so we can have all the fancy things as well but the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use. Mm. Mm. Mm. So try and get T_V_ manufacturers to Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Or you get it. Okay. Mm. Yours is well Yeah but the the mic should not Yeah. Mm. Can't help you with that. Okay  it's y yeah. Right. Then press uh al This. You know? Oh oh. Right well Wow. Amazing. It's working. Yeah. Under documents in the shared folder. Okay. Yeah  I guess we'll have a shared folder uh with documents that we can share. And uh  yeah. Yes. Each of us is going. Okay  shall I start? So  i But it's Actually  I think I cannot go with uh Yeah. Okay. You're on the knife. Mael. Yeah  I think I will go without without it  right? Yeah. And we should sum up its favourite charas characteristics  right? So Uh yeah. And i Th They like to sleep  that's why you said you they are like this. Yeah. She has the small legs. Yeah. Thank you  Matthew. Perfect. Oh a rat  okay. And you  A bird. Okay  in the water. Mm. Yeah. Put it colours. Maybe it would help us. With different pen widths. Ah it's a shark  yeah. Oh. You have some in in Australia  right? Yeah. I dunno. Oh well. Yeah. Perfect. So I dunno if we need to spend time on that  actually But uh Yeah  exactly  yeah. Wow. Yeah. Per remote control  yeah? Per project. So it's half of the selling price  if I am good in mathematics. Of course. Oh you're g very good in mathematics. Four million. Yeah. And uh just before starting the detailed discussion  maybe we You are the marketing guy? Or th So you are the marketing. And you are in the u use user interface uh design. So just yeah I wanted to to be sure. And I I'm the the industrial designer okay. Because I I don't know you very well  actually  but yeah. Okay. Mael. Happy to meet you. Okay. It's very uh Uh so yeah uh Just uh on your web page but uh yeah not uh not face to face. So mm So I Like what? Like internet on the on T_V_? Yeah. Actually  yeah w Of course  and first before um designing the func well thinking about the functionalities  we need to know what are the user requirements. Um then if they need internet  then we would be able to to p to propose something with uh uh T_V_ over I_P_. But before Yeah  but w w we want to design a new one. Mm. Yeah. The Yeah  the main is browsing. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Perfect. Okay. No I don't think so it has to be like that yeah and you have to adjust the length. Okay  and then. Yeah  s yeah  um. I think you can put anywhere you want  actually. I thin It's not a directional mic  anyway. Uh. Yeah. Last. Okay. Okay. 'Kay. Alt F_ five. So. Yes. Total. Whitebo Yeah  you can start it you know. No they will record through that. There's a sensor over there which is going to record the strokes that you make. Yeah. Yeah. 's a cat. Yeah. Ah you forget about it. Yeah  uh I think it's fine. I just don't want to carry it off. Man  this wires  eh? We need a wireless microphone. You know? Pro specially we should next project we should take l like that. So. Oh the dog doesn't have a tail? Yeah  sure  yeah. I thought so. The dogs have a tail. Yeah. It'll still not extend  right? It's not up to that. It's a horse. Ah I think you can put that. I'll tell to get it off my Uh? Mm-hmm. Oh y it's not for that. No. Okay. Yeah. So what should I draw? Mm. He has already to do cat. So The cat is going to eat the fish or the rat? Ah it's a baby shark  it looks to me  you know it's going to eat the cat rather than the cat eating the fish  no? You should go for the next one it seems to me. Twenty four. Ah yeah  the sale man  four million. They have to sell at least four million to make a profit Ah we have to make we have to sell at least four million to make our own profit. Fifty mill Of course it should have a on off button. Yeah  s and it depends what application you are using it for. You might need uh We are targ targeting the television set. So  you need to record the channels. You need to browse the browse the channels in upward downward way  Uh And Uh  and Marketing. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Oh. I'm Matthew. You know. Matth s uh Anna. And um uh Matthew  yeah. I thi think you know me  yeah? right yeah. So. So And uh  you'd need the usual ones  like the changing the volume  changing the the channel and then you uh Today we have uh um teletext and all those things. Tomorrow you might have a some more functions which might come through that  so Yeah I_P_O_ or. Now we are looking for television things or I_P_. For example personal video recorder and all those stuffs are coming up. Yeah. Ah it's it's it's it's coming up  actually. The personal video recorder and all those things it is coming up. Let's Let's take Oh in that case you can you always hook up with uh someone who is providing that and you know  you you sell their product as well as your product with them  you know. Yeah. No  it's okay  yeah I understand. So we need some numbering buttons  some teletext things and then um Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay  we are alread mm. Mm. Yeah. L Yeah  sure. Stam. Okay. So we uh we will wait for Anna  a few minutes. I think it should work like this. So I will try to get my presentation running. Mm. It's no matter. No problem. Ah yes. I don't know. Just try. On this normal Good. Doesn't appear on the screen here. Oh. Okay. Thank you. Uh. Yes and you can put can clip it uh on your Somewhere. So  good morning  everyone. Um Welcome at uh at the kick off meeting of our uh latest project. I hope you all have been uh updated about it. Good. So w we will try to structure this uh meeting with an a with an agenda uh as presented here. Um after the opening we will tr get acquainted to each other. See what our roles are in this project. So  um We have been provided with uh some uh w technical tools to uh to communicate and to well  learn from each other's plans uh as I can say um so w we will also try to uh to get acquainted to this tools so they are also new to me I don't know whether you worked with them before. Um then we will come to the uh to the to the actual project plan. You all know I hope how it's about uh the uh new r remote control we are going going to design. Uh then we will uh discuss uh  well  how it should be and uh wh what uh what our new product should look lite like. And uh well then uh after some twenty five minutes I hope uh we can end this meeting. So. Um basically this is about a uh a new c remote control. Um We When you design a new product you of uh you of course want it to be original. Be uh we want to be distinguished  mm? People uh want to uh when they look at the shelf want to think  well that's the product I I need. So it needs to be trendy. I mean trendy is what people want  so then I w they will buy our product. But then  uh  it also should work uh user friendly and uh otherwise people uh uh well it will not be uh be rated very well in consumer uh articles and like that. So  the general outline of uh new project will be we first uh go through a functional design phase. Um You all get uh um certain task uh in this uh in this phase and uh then we will meet again and uh discuss this functional design. And the same holds for the uh ph two phases uh after this  the conceptual design and after that a a more detailed design in which the the final project should get its definite shape. Alright  but first we will do some uh tool training. In all in front of you uh you see uh the uh notebooks and w uh n note blocks and we have here a a a a white-board. And um well it should work uh I've read it from my uh from some colleague that it should work with some kind of toolbar. I didn't find out yet how it work  but maybe one of you did  so Um Yes. Do Do we have to say something about that? I I I'm not fully updated about this shared folder uh. Yes well we will then find out ho how it works. Um. Well  this seems to me  yes  some computer program but I didn't find it yet. So  we'll come to that later. So  uh now we will try out the white-board we have here. So  I would suggest uh Well  yes  um we uh we should try to t to draw on it and then well it should be smart some way. I I'm not really sure how this works  but Yes  a good idea Mael. Okay. 'Kay. You you D doesn't it work? Maybe someo Maybe maybe Anna  maybe you can start. Then he can maybe find out to get his cord right. So um L Why don't you draw uh your favourite animal on on th on the white-board. Oh  I see uh Yeah. Yes. Mm. So draw it. We will try to guess what it is. Mm. It's like a cat  so I guess it's a cat. What is this now? So  that's the cat. Oh. It's a dog. So but that's also kind of cat  isn't it? B bo both predators. So  thank you. Uh d did you uh work out cord? Okay. Yes. Yes  yes this is Yes definitely a horse. Yes. Oh very good. So I suppose it Yes. Can you can meet them in Africa  I think. Yes. Very good. So Ma Matthew? So Maybe I hope you have some space in your uh the horse of uh Mael. This looks likes a cat who has been driven over. Yes  the moustache. That's that's definitely a cat. It's quite  you know relaxed situation. Yes. Yes  okay. Th thank you  Matthew. Yes  this is certain uh some contribution to our project. So. Let's see. Which animal has not been drawn yet. So you've all drawn land animals  so why not draw an animal from the water. Mm. Yes. So Oh  yes  why not? Good idea. Why not. A swordfish. I hope it still works. So W Well  this uh this tool seemed to work. Let's continue to uh to the real stuff. Um our project uh finance uh thing. Uh when we are and when w you are uh going to design w uh we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product uh will be about twenty five Euros  so when designing a project uh I also look at you uh Mael  keep in mind uh uh uh People uh want to get the feeling this is a twenty five Euro project uh pr um product. Yes. Okay. Um more interesting for our company of course  p uh profit aim  about fifty million Euro. So we have to sell uh quite a lot of this uh um things. Uh we will try to uh to get at a international market uh so um it will be I think mainly Europe and uh Northern America  maybe some uh Asian countries. Um also important for you all is um the the product uh production cost must be maximal uh twelve uh twelve Euro and fifty cents. Yes  of course. Uh um I mean we still have to uh to make a profit  huh? You all have to be paid. Excuse me? Yes  indeed. So uh well I think w when we are working on the international market  uh in principle it has enough customers uh so when we have a good product we uh we could uh meet this this aim  I think. So  that about finance. And uh now just let have some discussion about what is a good remote control and uh well keep in mind this this first point  it has to be original  it has to be trendy  it has to be user friendly. Um  maybe someone can mention some additional uh prerequisites for a good remote control. Yes  well i it should have the the the the expected functionality uh of a remote control. We wer we were thinking television. Uh. Mm-hmm. Yes  yes. Th th that's very handy I I always miss it and on some remote controls that you can go channel up or down ins instead of retyping the number  especially when you have a lot of channels. Yes. Yes. A and I'm Nanne. So Yes. So. Um S S s Are there some other very important things to to do well  to specify in this first phase of of the project. So the browse function  as you m mentioned. Yes. Yeah. Yes. Mm  well uh I I think Uh w y you two should should  I think  think this over uh w espec what  what functionality. Mm-hmm. Mm mm mm. Keep k keep in mind i it's a it's a twenty five Euro unit  so uh uh the the very fancy stuff uh w we can leave that out  I think. So twenty five Euro you expect a quite  well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control. Yes  but but but ab about the spec the buttons  the buttons uh that will be on it. I I think we can discuss that in the in the next meeting. Uh I would like to get this wrapped up and go to an end of this meeting. So So you know now the basic the basic things. And well just just for the next meeting  um well  uh  you wor yes  work on a design  keep it general  I mean so w we will be still fle flexible with maybe adding some functions. So Um you will be working on on technical function design  so And uh you and you and uh uh uh well  think about requirements  eh? Does it need internet  or or do do we stay at basic basic television uh interface. So  uh I think we should now all go work uh uh at this and uh you will be informed via email and other kind of communication. So next meeting will be in uh in thirty minutes uh. K keep it in mind. ,The Project Manager introduced the project to the group and gave an agenda for the project as a whole. She then introduced a tool training exercise to acquaint the group with the meeting-room tools and to help them get to know each other. The Project Manager then presented the project budget to the group and presented the projected profit aim  the production cost  and the price point of the device. The group then began a discussion about features of remote controls and their own  experiences with them. They discussed making the remote universally compatible and ergonomically-designed  and types of batteries to use. The Project Manager instructed the Industrial Designer to work on the internal working design of the device. The User Interface Designer was told to work on the technical function design  and the Marketing Expert was instructed to research the needs of users. 
It is a banana. It is the essence of bananas. I would be confused with this thing. S How is everyone? Mm-hmm. Like a banana. I give it a I give it a five. And you? Do you vote uh Christine? Do you also vote? Well  we can very easily. I So it will have five point five average. Mm. It's four. Yeah. D are we including the voice are you glu are we including the voice in the end or not? Huh? No. Okay. Yeah. For twenty five. Yeah. I give a seven  I think. 'Kay. Yeah  we can we can put a seven here. Yeah. Yeah. Well  we hope. Yeah. Yeah  I think it's cool. I think we can put a six here. So you'll make the material transparent so that it uh lights up completely  or Yeah. Yeah the only problem there might be which know  i if it's very sensitive  they will  I don't know Yeah  okay. Mm. Six  yeah  for me. Yeah. Twenty. Thirty. Thir Okay. Yeah  the top Mm. So will become eight soon? Yeah  well it's a bit biased. Okay. Because I saw uh some phones that were banana shaped  uh wireless phones not mobile ones  wireless for the house  uh quite big also  and they were selling something like a hundred Euros  two hundred Euros. Just a just a phone  wireless. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  it's much more complex  but Okay. Congratulations to the team. Uh very well  we worked together fantastically. So what does the management say? What does the management say? Ah. Yeah. Okay. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. So uh you can have my project in Uh yeah just a Four. Evaluation. Okay. So you can go. We can go through. So I made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about uh during the previous uh meetings. So you can go through and okay so uh we have uh six points. We we talked about before. So we we want to have a product fancy look and feel  technologically innovative  easy to use  fashion  easy to find in a room  and robust  uh and uh uh I have a scale of uh seven points. Okay. So I go through all the uh all the points here  and uh according to what you think about the this project you can uh mm make a one point  two point or seven point. Okay? And after we ha we have an an average  and uh we see. The okay? Uh so uh fancy look and feel  what do you think? F between o one and seven. Yeah. Seven is the Mm-hmm. sorry. eh? No  I just want to see something Mm-hmm. Uh I think uh and need to as well. Need to uh I don't know if you we ha we have to put uh one uh f If it's better or Uh-uh. Um. Yeah. Or maybe we can say s seven is the best mm. Oh sorry. Six Uh s you can how much what? Oh yes I mm I dunno mm  I think six  it's a good uh Yeah. Wa can. Okay. I sorry. Okay. So after  the technological aspect? So we we said uh we have uh a new technological uh thing with a wheel. Uh. No. Four. We can put four? Everyone is okay or four poin Four. Okay. Very easy to use. Do you think it's easy to use? Mm  six for me also. Six point five. Okay. Is it fashion? Seven? Yeah it's fashion  because it's a fruit  and we say that the yeah  seven. Uh easy to find in a room? Yeah? We have the lightning  or The lighting. Yeah. Seven? Is it is it robust? Everybody is okay  six. Yeah. Okay. S now um so. Thirteen uh  twenty  twenty six point five  uh seven  thirty two  thirty six. That's that's okay? Six. Good. Uh if we say that seven it's uh it's the better  and when uh s six sit six are good it's a good uh p product  I think. We have a good price and uh. Good. Mm-hmm. Mm 'kay. Hi. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I will give a a five. Five. A four also  because  except for the wheel  we don't have so much innovation. The rubber is Uh a four. I I Yeah. Six. Six. Six six six point five. Yeah  seven. Easy to find. I lost my banana. Uh. Six. Yeah  okay. Uh f yeah  it's ru it's rubber. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Six or five. Five. Six. Yeah. Mm-hmm. But almo also the complexity between a phone and a remote control is not cannot compare. Start to eat banana. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Fruits. Okay. Je croix que c'est dommage de le it will be sad to destroy this prototype. It really looks like a banana. It is a banana. Mm. Okay. Hi. So we are here for the detailed design meeting. So we will uh I will first present what we are going to do in this meeting. Then uh I've I will also take notes during this meeting and I will send you uh a summary then as usual. We will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by uh our two colleagues that make good work. And uh then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product. Then we will uh evaluate the product. And uh end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not. So d let's start with the cost aspect so so I look at the aspect discussed last time  that is to say uh to have a standard battery  to have a yellow banana shaped uh case with uh a rubber material around it to be uh to feel spongy  and uh also at the different aspect like having a wheel etcetera. And the cost ended to be ten point seven Euros. So which is uh good  because we had a price gap of twelve point five Euros. So for the financial aspect it's okay  we can uh we can continue with this product uh as if  and we are now going to see the project evaluation with uh our marketing expert. Yeah. You have a presentation? Participant four  yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Maybe you can presen okay. Maybe hold it. So I think it's uh very uh very nice. What do you think? Yeah. So it's between one and seven? Seven is the highest uh? I will give a six. Maybe we all have to agree on a common Yeah. No problem. So this is your One is most. Well  we can choose what we want. Okay  let's say that seven is the best. Okay. So so do note the grade we have five  six for me  five. And what what's your choice? How much would you give on the fancy aspect  on the fashionable aspect? How much would you you don't answer to this uh questionnaire? Five point five average. Okay. Well  does it Okay  techne technological aspect. Yeah  we have the wheel. We also have the rubber material  which make it uh like new also. I think I would give a five. Four? Okay. No. So what's your uh grade? Four? So we have four  four f and five? Yeah  four. Four  yeah  let's put four. Doesn't it Yeah  I think so. Yeah. I would give a I would give a seven as well. It's very easy to use. So six point five. Okay. Oh yeah  its its f its fruit fruit shape. I would say seven. And is very very nice design. Yeah. Seven  okay. I think you can't miss it. Okay. Yeah  we have the we don't sesh especially have the lightning but So it's yellow. It's okay. I think it's very easy to I would say seven. It's hard to miss it. Yeah  it's rubber  made of rubber  I think it's m it's uh more rubber than uh other remote control. Yeah. But it is uh it is surrounded by rubber material. So maybe we can put a six. Six is okay? Yeah. Tadada. We have to sum up everything. Six is a good Yeah  the be. Okay  so six is a So it's a good evaluation  I think. It's very promising. Huh. So this prototype is quite nice. Yeah. Okay. So having this at twenty five Euros is uh quite attractive  I think. I think the Yeah. So  I think  we can summarise. So we have seen the prototype. It's very nice according to the work of our two designer. The the the financial aspect were okay. We we have the cost below uh our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five Euros and make i make profit. The the evaluation give satisfying result as well. So I think we can move to the last part of the meeting. So the cost is in the budget  the evaluation is okay  so I th I think we can now uh open champagne and make a huge party. I don't know if it's provided by uh by the meeting staff. Okay so congratulation. Nice product. Yeah. I think it was a good collaboration uh. Aspect. Sorry? I think we will have um much bigger project next time and a much bigger salary as well. All it depends on who watch this meeting. We don't know. Okay  so good guys  so see you for next uh successful project. ,The Project Manager went over new requirements for the project: that the device was solely to control television  and that there would not be a teletext component. The Industrial Designer gave his presentation on the basic components of a remote control device  and advised the group to use plastic for the casing material instead of metal. The User Interface Designer presented the technical functions of remote controls and compared the interfaces of two existing remote control products. The Marketing Expert made a presentation of the needs and the desires of the consumer and emphasized simplicity as one of the most desired features. The group discussed in more detail the features that will be added to the device: the possible applications of voice recognition  the touch screen menu interface  faceplates  and the look of the company logo. 
Could have one for your stereo  one for your D_V_ player. Yeah I kinda had a a kinda a natural kind of a idea where it's like more of a kind of like a kinda maybe slightly like thinner  yeah  kinda like that kinda like a flower or a plant for the more natural kinda Uh yeah  just click there. Uh the the maximise button. Evaluation. The the product or the project? Um  well well my presentation just now? Sure  uh can I get the Cheers. There we go  oh. Method of evaluation testing the product was to just if it met all the criteria all the conditions that we set out to set out to solve  from the point of view of the the consumer and the management. So what I've been asked to do is  on the whiteboard um gauge our team response to these questions. So  on a scale of one to seven  one being true and seven being being false. Yeah. And then at the end just take an average Yes. So uh. So  look at these questions. Is the device f flashy and fashionable? So uh and also uh technologically innovative? Easy to use? Uh suitable for the consumer? That was um Yeah. Uh is it complicated? Doing pretty well so far aren't we? Uh functional? Um. Where are we? We've b built in the the speech  where are you  function. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. And uh  what else? The R_S_I_ compares to the current standards  well. We we uh yeah it was our it was a we made an actual effort to Um will device appeal to all age groups? Yeah  uh that's a good call  yeah. Well we had the we had the data saying that old people will be less likely to pay extra money but the funct the increased functionality  the e ease of use of the device might make up for that. Mm. Uh can you just click the my mouse to move onto next page? Uh  yeah and what h did we make the management's Um. Okay. So uh one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven. Eleven divided by eleven's one so equals average of one. And that roughly concludes my evaluation of the of the product. Mm. S And so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic  just kind of a light non-descript grey so that people'll wanna buy the covers and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make iPod covers  so they kinda just stretch over. Yeah  well I I didn't know that but yeah they're kind of it's just kind of a rubbery and that way you know spongy like is something that people wanted and it just sort of stretches over and that way I think probably helps protect it a little bit too as well and just kinda stretch it over and it'll just stay on and then the buttons come through and so and then the each one of 'em on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the R_R_. Yeah. Like that. Oh. Yeah. Yeah  just kind of Or just make it little. Somewhere like that so it just sort of Yeah. Bu. fall over. Yeah. Yeah.. 'S a little longer. Yeah. I think it is yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah I think it made we met all of the consumer wants. No. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think so. Yeah. Yeah I think just the simplicity of it and not having to learn to programme and not having you know a million buttons. Under the cost. Yeah . I mixed up the colours a little bit. I think I all wrong. Mm. Ps I don't think so  I mean I think we worked well together and looked really at what the consumers wanted and what we were trying to make and you know  seemed to discuss things pretty well and come to group consensus and Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Yeah. Okay. Uh okay we basically have the same kinda lay-out here it's just um you hold it like this and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand  basically. Um on the left we've got the scroll for the volume  on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda so you can hold it and scroll  or you can hold it and and push. Uh this is the power key  um it's kinda like the biggest so you know how to turn on. Uh that's the little menu key. This is the infra-red section so you g it'll be sending rays and if you're you know pointing it like that it can send it  or if you hold it up like that it'll send it. Uh we got a microphone there which for all the voice commands so you can you know talk to it like that and it'll still understand. Um the logo is down down there um and has the cover on it and you can see like it just kinda goes the red bit's the cover and it kinda goes over everything and then there's holes for the buttons to come through. Um. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. But it's also e e easier to put on versus like mobile covers you actually have to screw them on and stuff and you kinda sometimes have to get someone to do that for you. This is very much you should be able to stretch it over yourself and it'll be fine. Yeah. Yeah. Li that'll be the covers as well  yeah yeah. Yeah it could stand  yeah. Well we could broaden the broaden it out a bit so it would stand like that. Yeah  standing. Yeah  we could just widen it out uh Mm. Mm. Mm  yeah  yeah. Have to if we just lengthen it I guess so it comes down to the base of the hand and then flatten it out and could sit there. Yeah  mm. Yeah. Yeah. We might have to lengthen it so it kinda your hand still holds it and have it there  yeah  yeah  yeah like that  like that. Yeah. Mm. The final product would actually stand up  yeah. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Wee Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah I'd say definitely a one yeah. Yeah  defi yeah  yeah Yeah. Yeah definitely. Yeah. Yeah definitely. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  mm-hmm. No  not at all. Uh Yeah it is sorta the the handle more ergonomically correct as well. yeah. Mm. Mm. Mm. I I I think it will tend to appeal more to younger aged groups just 'cause we have gone with the fashion focus and the younger people tend to would be more conscious of that aspect of it  but um I think it should still appeal on a certain level to everybody  yeah. Yeah  yeah. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yep. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yep. Yep. Well done us. Excellent. Oh no that's Uh.. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah  definitely. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yep. Yep. Cool  thank you  Right well. Welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings and uh it looks like we've uh done a good job here and uh we'll just go through the the final uh the final details. Um okay  oh the um th the the minutes of the last meeting uh I think we'll take those as read  um Okay the um th the the next uh thing we we we'll have a look at the uh th have a look at the prototypes and uh look at the uh evaluation criteria and finance and then uh uh just tidy up with production and um and then we can close. Um So f if if you'd like to uh present your your proposals. Uh-huh. Yep  yeah  good  good. Uh-huh. Yep  right. Uh-huh. Yep  yep  mm-hmm. Uh-huh. Yep yep. Yep. showing me age  I don't know what i c iPod covers are like. Yeah yeah. Uh-huh. Okay  yep  right. Okay. Yep. Okay  good yeah. Yep  right. Yeah  yeah. I mean tha it's it's a detailed point  I just wondered I mean h how will people put these down I wonder? Right. Okay for some strange re reason I had it in my mind that they'd put them down vertically but uh uh Yeah  uh no because particularly if they've dif if they're gonna have it as a you know as a fashion item uh I mean it it's uh it it's just I mean it's just a minor detailed point  but um as you say you can just make the base a little bit bigger and uh Yeah and uh it just needs another uh another logo somewhere is is is is all it gives gives people the option and if if say if they've got them um because actually have several upon the uh Yeah  well. Yeah but that that's uh but uh no the the the overall uh the overall concept is uh yeah yeah  no no  I mean that's these uh Yeah. But uh yeah but no th but the yeah the the the Yeah  yeah  yeah  I mean it it's uh wouldn't wouldn't do that  indeed yeah. But th th but th yeah th b the these were all minor minor uh minor details  I think the uh the basic concept i i is is absolutely bang on and the i it certainly meets our criteria of being uh of you know looking different. Um  so good that's that that's excellent. Um right let us um What's on the next one? Oh right yes  let's have a look at the um f finance. Um  now we're given a a clear design brief  uh if I get the uh spreadsheet up. Oh.. Oh right. Ah. Good  this is why we need to make these things simple so that the uh the the the boss can understand. Now I've um this is the company's uh uh costing for for various uh uh aspects of design and I I I've treated some of these slightly uh liberally given the constraints placed on us  um I wouldn't know for in for instance if if they require us to have it in the corporate colours  then that is not a special colour  that's a that's a standard colour. Uh  so we're just simply on batteries  the the one th the one decision I've had to make is that um we're we will have to find a s a regular standard chip to to do this with and I I um I'm I'm I'm certain that they they are around so  um that I don't think is a a serious problem. The uh the the voice sensor is is expensive but we we made a a basic decision that that was absolutely fundamental to the to the design so that that has to stay. Um then again the the the the shape of the case means that it's it's expensive to uh um l to make 'cause of the the th the double curves but on the other hand because of our overall fashion concept um we we should exceed the the sales targets. Um it's simply made of plastic so th that's uh that's no problem and uh um just because the whole the colour of the the whole thing that's uh uh there's some cost there. Um and uh we haven't actually got a scroll wheel we we we got push buttons and and a simple uh um slider so um and the and the the buttons are uh uh well I do don't know that they're special colour. Anyway the the costings uh come in at exactly on target at twelve point five uh but I thi I think we have a a very strong case to argue that uh what what we've got is is so in innovative and uh and different that um any any slight compromise we have to make on on cost is is offset by the uh you know the uh you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers so uh um you know the if if if the management expect us to be techno again fail again technologically innovative um that they they have to accept that we we can't operate absolutely within uh the constraints that they give  so uh we we we present this as the uh the company's uh the the company's way forward and uh uh I I think we can argue that we we have uh come in on on budget. Um. Okay  uh. So um. Does anybody want to uh uh Andrew do you want what do you want to say about um the uh yeah the evaluation where where you know well where where we're where where we're at? The the the well the I meant the product. Yeah. Oh sorry yeah um  mm. Mm. More loud clicks in the microphone. Seven being a nice round number to work to. Tr On for true and seven for flase. Yes. Well I think most definitely. Yes the voice technology indeed. I don't see we could've made it any easier. Totally. No. Yeah. found easily. yeah I mean that's that's Yeah. Does it take long to learn to use? Shouldn't. Less buttons so it must be. So yeah  um um. I think it will because I mean uh old older people who can't manage the buttons anyway will actually probably like the like like the voice bit so And it's it's it's well I don't think we're actually charging a particular premium anyway  in the end  so Yeah. Yeah. It will appeal f for dif for different reasons but it's it's uh yeah yeah so I I yeah I Yeah  so I think we can reasonably say it's another another one  why not? in in in in my interpretation of management's instructions uh is that yes it it meets the requirement is t it's television only  it's it's simple to use  um it's it's it's within budget  um I it's uh yes an an any minor points we we we argue. So uh I I think we've done an amazing job in uh coming up with what Need a need a calculator for that. Okay  nick the cable back then. Ooh. Right do um either of you want to uh say anything? Mm. Before I uh No. Yeah. Yeah. Well that's right  I mean th this this slide here I mean the satisfaction with uh room for creativity  I mean I think we've allowed ourselves uh as much creativity as the uh the the the product uh allows. Um I won't comment on leadership  uh teamwork I think we've uh I think everybody's uh worked pretty well together. Um we've just about coped with the whiteboard and digital pens  uh I think the results speak for itself and new ideas found  um  again gi no given relatively everyday product  I think we've v very uh very effectively come up with a a new uh uh a new approach. Um are the costs within budget? Yes. Is the project evaluated? We're we're all happy that it it meets all the criteria  um Thank you very much indeed  I think that I think that's uh I think we can go f for an early bath. So I call the meeting closed. Not sure how far ahead of schedule we were there. ,The Project Manager gave new requirements for the product: the remote will not include a teletext function  will only be used for television  and must show the corporate image. The Industrial Designer presented  possible components to consider. The group then discussed hard materials to include in the design. The Marketing Expert presented an initial sales plan and showed that there is a demand for remotes featuring voice recognition and other capabilities; the group discussed how it could be integrated into the functional design. The Project Manager offered to help the Industrial Designer find companies to provide help in integrating this component. The designers expressed that they needed more information from the board on their expectations for the product. The User Interface Designer gave a presentation on product design from the user's perspective and emphasized simplicity in design. She also suggested that the group make a decision on which features to include in the final product design  but the group decided to postpone it. The designers were given their assignments: the Marketing Expert will present the marketing concept; the User Interface Designer  the user interface concept; the Industrial Designer  the components concept. 
You all saw the newsflash? Or you got the same message? Yeah sorry. Yeah. Yeah I received an email so I thought I I can't mail you so I thought I'd just drop it in the folder  but Is it unlocked? Woah. I uh kind of opened it. Uh Okay. 'Kay. Everybody ready? No no no. Yes yes yes. Okay. 'Kay. Can we get started or is there some pressing issue? Oh no pressing. Did you plug in the power cable when you come back? Yeah. That's difficult. Yeah. Yeah. Format save. Yeah. Oh yeah sure. You have Playstation also? Huh. Okay. So there we are again. Yeah. Okay this is the agenda. Um we have three presentations  I heard. Yeah really. So who wants to start? Yeah. Uh this is you? 'Kay. Yeah. often. Next generation does. N not used anymore. Yeah. Yeah. Not by mail. I receiv the mail but you don't. So That's in the presentation  so Uh below I believe. Yeah below forty. Mm-hmm. Our current customers are in the age group forty plus. And the new product should reach new markets  which is the customers below forty. That's in a newsflash. Yeah. But it also needs to have corporate identity. Present and the colours. So we can't change much of that. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. 'Kay. It's open already so you can use to find yours. F_ five. Go Jurgen. You pressed alt F_ four? Oh great. Yeah. Uh maybe you can do it from your computer so talk us through it. Yeah. That's nice. F_ five. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. The mm yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So n it's very easy. Now yeah it's okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah so maybe you can hide them or something. Yeah you make a screen menu or something. Mm-hmm. Yeah and the other oth other uh functionality is the screen. What does the screen do? Yeah. It's low power. So what does the screen do? They said they needed it but what does it do? What do they want with the screen? Yeah that's what we make it up. So but what did the marketing No. Yeah okay it's handy. With no predefined uh We're back online. Okay. Mm-hmm. Content and form. Yeah. That was the end. Okay. Uh which one is it? Technical functions? This one? Functional requirements? No. You didn't put it in? Or it's not really English. Uh kick off. Oh working design I got it. Here you go. Just uh press uh yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Design yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah decoder. Blank. Yeah okay. Work harder. Yeah. Uh 'Kay. Um for those that didn't see yet um the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext  only for T_V_. Uh it should be designed for a use g uh group below forty  but I don't think it's w wrong if we can uh target the current customer group as well. And uh the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote control. And we have to decide on the functions  and on the  let's see what was it  uh the target group. We have to make be clear what that is. Yeah users. Yeah so I think it's easy but Yeah it's below forty so we can decide where to Okay. So below forty is okay. But we need an lower level which to s uh focus. So is it from sixteen to forty? Is it from twenty to forty? Is it from thirty? Yeah? 'Kay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Design. Mm. Mm-hmm. And maybe y Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So is you should have a menu for all the the functions you don't use regular and which are Yeah. Aye yeah. Shall I uh Yeah. It's okay. no  it doesn't have line control  so Yeah we get the The remote  yeah? Basic. Is on top. Which should be easy  easily reached with the thumb. T I s should said right. Because yeah. Mm-hmm. Do the also with the thumb. So it should be a little bit longer so that you can put your uh thumb  also reach the middle. Or you should screen at the bottom and then you can see it very clearly. You you need to be able to hold it so Yeah. Yeah okay that's true. Layout. That's for the I can't help it. Yeah. Man. Yeah okay. You want the normal piece of paper? And you have a pen? Yeah? Mm-hmm. Uh. And the for flipping up and down. Yeah. And left to right. And those can also be used for the menu. Yeah. Yeah okay but this is function so if you can use them for multiple things For the menu. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah but that depends on where you put the screen. But it's essential that there is a screen. Yeah. And for the speech uh recognition part  if we want to incorporate that  we need a microphone. Yeah. This would be uh No that's not s sure so uh we need a display. Yeah. Yeah they're used to it. Mm-hmm. Yeah but then it's possible that you cover it with your hand so I think that top is the best option. Yeah okay. Depends on the sensitivity of the microphone  but I think that's okay. Volume. Up. Channel up and down  and the control of the advanced options. So maybe it  we should decide what advanced options we want to put in the L_C_D_ screen. Yeah so sounds? Yeah and they're They're not used often so Yeah just Yeah sounds. Yeah. Of course. I'm just a secretary. Coffee? Treble bass. Uh Pitch I believe  yeah. Yeah. Yeah and mono stereo. Mm. And also the tuning part? Yeah programming. So channel programming? Mm. Yeah. Contrast yeah. Mm. No. Uh  so contrast  bright  uh And the others were in your presentation right? So I can just copy those? Okay. It's easy. Yeah the button options and the L_C_D_ options. Indeed. Yeah. Yeah you have basically a button menu  which you can use directly  uh according to the old principle. And the L_C_D_ options are activated by some some software options  thats communicates with the infrared uh decoder yeah. So you You have an additional processor and and software part. Compared to o Mm-hmm. L_ s Yeah. Colour. Yeah I I call it contrast. Yeah I make it c colour. Yeah. Yeah and automatically um Mm-hmm. Yeah so I've g channel program is autoseek? Uh name a channel  or Oh they get automatic names  okay.. Yeah. Yeah but can you also say I want f uh Veronica on the channel number uh five or Yeah. Yeah. How do you call that? Channels? Yeah. Ninety nine or something. Yeah. S swap channels? Can I call it that? Swap's good option. Okay. Uh other functions? Mm-hmm. Okay. Well that's 's up to uh Mister User Interface Designer. Also. That's you're Yeah but also  which buttons you have to press to get a certain result? And the working design was to specify how ph the physical interation between the components was  as I believe. No I don't think so. But I think the communication with the television is difficult. But that's not our part. We don't have to design a protocol so No that's the Yeah. So but Um The User Interface Designer can design a menu for all these function I put them on the. Yeah. Yeah I can. I'll just try to reorganise uh things. Um So you design the basic function menu for the L_C_D_ screen? Uh um I think th I think the yeah the layout of the screen and I think you can concentrate more on the button placement and the placement of the uh screen itself on the. No I d I think that's more in. Yeah. Okay. So he's layout and you're function. Form function okay. Yeah. I think i that's your department yes  because w he already knows what Yeah. But we're not allowed. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah and also make clear which buttons to press to get certain result  because that's always the difficulty. Every device has its own Menu okay. Yeah. Mm. Back. Yeah. Yeah but they're incorporated? Up and down is Smart? Put it on top. Mm-hmm. Well But that's uh J Jurgen's department. You just make the layout. You do we do the extra two buttons or not? Yeah. Yeah okay. That's true. And to  okay and back  also. And of course the four arrows. But those are still y doubly used. Both the L_C_D_ Yeah. Menu button access the menu in the L_C_D_ screen. You can navigate. But you can also navigate the channels. And the volume. Those are both both yeah. Oh five minutes. Light uh Yeah sure. Okay. Um Anything else? I've Volume. Well we have those buttons. We use all four. Yeah okay go ahead. Yeah that was already decided. Okay that's what we decided earlier on. Right okay. So yeah I wanna close down. I have to  sorry. it's not because I don't like you but yh we have lunch break  and then we can work for thirty minutes  and I have to write very fast to make the minich min minutes. And then uh we'll see I don't know. Nobody told me. No I th believe there's first lunch break. Yeah. Or you can just Yeah? 'Kay. I think you can put uh the laptop back in the room and 'Kay. Yeah it's a lot of pressure. That's okay. Oh yeah. I don't know if it works but it should be saved. Yeah. It's uh Should be here. Smart board. Don't know if you can use it but Yeah. I try to organise it by these three. Yeah yeah yeah. I don't really mind. I just put the minutes here and we'll see. Yeah that's in the functional design uh folder. Yeah. Yeah that's just basically what I just showed. Yeah. Yeah I got it by yeah. I'm gonna get kicked if I don't do it so Make me proud. Yeah. I believe so. just ask. Yeah I I just saw it one minute ago. When I uh Yeah. Yeah pretty much. Mm. Yeah that's my presentation. Mm? Oh right. Ooh. Well Alright. Huh. You read the newsflash? Hmm. What? Hmm. alt delete.. So it doesn't draw the attention away. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I I had a whole idea and then just was typing it and then oh. I have to do that so switch. Mm. By your humble P_M_. Yeah that's fine. We have to start it right away? Functional? Yeah functional requirements. Alright. I'm gonna talk about functional requirements. Um Well uh some research has be done uh has been done. Uh observing of one hundred uh subjects in the usability lab using a remote control. Uh and they also filled in a questionnaire. The findings were um  well you can see them for yourself. They disliked the look-and-feel of current remotes controls. Users think they're ugly. Um they do not match the the operating behaviour of the users. So they they d they don't match what they want to have on it. Um they are often lost somewhere in the room. Um it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control. And they're bad for R_S_I_. I don't know uh how a user can reach that but okay. Um there is also uh was also some research on uh the most relevant and and and irrelevant uh f functions. Uh most irrelevant and less used were audio settings  mono  stereo  uh pitch  bass. Um screen settings for brightness and colour and stuff like that. Um but they are used. I mean the Yeah they do need to be on the on the remote control. I mean if you can't control the the sound settings I mean if you dislike a very uh loud bass or something  you you need to change that. So um yeah we have to. We c we c Yeah I mean w we can't my my T_V_ has  but we we can leave them uh away. Uh most relevant  uh most used functions  uh they speak for themselves I guess. Uh power button  uh channel  volume selection. Uh teletext but we can skip that because I saw the newsflash  and teletext is so outdated that it it's i should not be used uh any more in the future. So forget this one. Uh channel settings  so for programming uh your channels in in the right order. Yeah  on on the project uh No so it's a text file n in the project folder. So teletext can be skipped. Um there was some research on new features in a remote control. Uh about an L_C_D_ screen uh and speech recognition. Well we got an update for the for the audience. Or the the the targeted group. So it's above forty I guess. The new product? Or below because that's pretty relevant. I thought I read a Yeah? Below? Okay well that's that's in the newsfla okay that's a good to know. Um because you see see a clear distinction between the age groups  concerning the features. I mean uh above forty people are not so interested uh not so interested in a screen or speech recognition. Uh but below that age they uh they pretty much are. So I think we can build that in. Um Yeah well we can skip this part as well  because I thought I read above forty so we could skip the features  but we just have to build them in because uh they find it very interesting. Um well we have to keep all the classic functions but make the buttons as user-friendly as possible. Um and and also there's so not only the design of the bus uh buttons but o how you can push them  and stuff like that. So the physical uh aspect of it. Um And I think and certainly for for the for the lower age groups  uh nice design  which uh does not make the remote control in your room. It's it's actually a part of your interior  of of your design in your room. So it's the people can say  well what's that  well that's my remote control  so it's d it has to look nice and feel nice  and and have all the functions that uh Yeah so the the logo has to be uh present yeah  and the colours as well. Yeah so but I I don't think that's that's a problem because the thing has to have a colour anyway  and most of the times there is a brand present on it. So I think that's not gonna gonna affect it very uh very much. Well that are the the consequences uh on a marketing uh part. Yes.. Yeah. Just yeah. Sure. Yeah. Alright. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah and and and marketing research stated that that that kind of users are not afraid of of a lot of functions. So not not too much but yeah. And the speech recognition yeah. Yeah from age of sixteen so yeah. Mm. Yeah but uh the the newsflash also stated that it should control only one device  only your television. So w So there are not extra options in this case  but uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah well what what we can do with the screen is is all the the configuration options  you can put that in the screen. And the and the yeah screen menu to to to uh to do that  and then the basic function just on the device itself. So it looks very simple and all the advanced features are hidden in the screen  uh with a clear menu. Uh. What are wh What. Yeah well it yeah it didn't it didn't say what they want to do with the screen. Well I  my guess is it's it's pretty handy for advanced uh advanced functions. Yeah searching for channels  programming them. Yeah. Yeah. Well you can improvise right? So we we can go for So we can go for the look-and-feel of the the left example  and then a screen on top of it. Yeah. Design? Yeah. Okay. Yeah frequency. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah we want to incorporate in uh into it. Mm. group of users  or because it says below forty I mean. I guess that's that's the tar yeah uh or male and female Uh six the marketing research started on s on the age of sixteen. Sixteen to twenty five  twenty five to thirty five  thirty five to forty five  something like that. So um How do you mean? Uh sixteen to forty. Well I I guess people of sixteen are are quite used to technology. So they they adapt to it pretty soon I guess. Yeah. But uh all incorporated in the screen or or just on the remote itself? Yeah like like you have a visual of the of the brightness with with a kind of sliding bar and a bus and and stuff like that for sound and and vis and and visuals? Uh you can make a if you make a drawing. Uh Uh. Uh black's okay. And draw it very big. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah well  this is basically uh it's alright the remote? Um well usually the power button is on top I guess. Yeah so it should fit right in into your hand. Right. Right. I most people are right-handed so maybe left-handed special addition  but okay. If you put it like like here. Or something. I dunno. Um then you could put a screen  like on a mobile phone  also on top I guess. Okay so y yeah you have you have it in your hand  and the screen is below  and the buttons are in the middle. Okay for example if you put the screen here  it's more about the functions now than the than the layout. Doesn't work too well. It's uh it's bent.. Yeah. Right. Okay you get it. Uh for example if y if you put all the Right. Yeah. Maybe this. kind of works. Like if you have like uh ten buttons for for all the for all the channels  um and here one for for Yeah that that usually uh like here  here  here  here. So you have up and down for the for the channels  and left and right for the volume uh Yeah. Yeah. And you you have most of the time you have one button in the middle. It says menu  and then if you press it you the screen gets activated and then you can use these buttons to scroll up and down and left and right to go into functon and then just mo most of the time this menu button is also like okay  to to confirm a a kind of action. So you scroll into it  okay. You select a function like v like uh bass. You just adjust it with these two buttons. Then okay to confirm  and then uh on on each on each screen there's there should be an option to go back to a to a upper level. And then finally say okay  exit. Or or one button to exit it. Uh in one time I dunno  that's not really my department. That's more your uh your department to to uh to Yeah. But it should be if the screen is here then the logo should be like on on top  yeah. I mean it's uh Yeah. Yeah I mean the position of the screen is also more essential than I mean we we look where we have space left and then put the logo over there. But um Yeah so it should be I mean if you have it in your hand here  should be on top somewhere  maybe. I mean i That's not sure but it's Yeah I mean a screen on top looks more lo logical to me. Also because people use m mobile phones and they also have the screen on top. So you you just have to reach a little bit for the power button. I mean if you grab it. But most most of the times if a if if a T_V_'s on standby people just press a channel to put it on. So we put this on top  and then make the corporate logo like over here. R_R_. And j and the microphone  I mean it can be very small. If you look at your mobile phones are some stripes  little little holes. Yeah maybe on the side. I mean if the if the microphone is good. Yeah okay. So on the on the top is better. Yeah.. Yeah it doesn't matter that much. So but um the screen is on top? Which functions did we have left? I mean this is basically numbers  volume  uh channel up and down. Screen is over there. Yeah. Yeah. That's uh that's a good one. Yeah. Sound? Yeah. Equaliser. So if you have sound But not too advanced. I mean most T_V_s use only treble and bass. Yeah. It's uh pretty hard to write. Mm. Okay but you have sound? Yeah just oh y you have digital uh better write it down over there yeah. So you have sound. Yeah. Uh yeah sound and then within sound I guess treble and bass? Yeah. Also. Pitch. Yeah. But pitch  isn't that yeah that's the the height of the tone. Yeah okay  wh why would you use that? If people like talk like uh Yeah. Programming part. Uh so we have sound  yeah? Channel programming. Mm. I think it g it gets annoying. I mean most mobile phones used that in the beginning but Yeah. Yeah but people don't want to sit on their knees on their knees in front of their television with only three buttons then it's very hard to y yeah contrast and brightness? Yeah those are the most used I guess. If you look at your monitor. Well yeah well I guess that these were the only ones  I guess. Yeah. I will look it up. Yeah with the chip and then I mean Uh yeah. Well yeah we have power button  whether that's present. Channel volume selection present. Uh numbers present. Yeah a audio settings  mono  stereo  pitch  bass  treble. Screen settings  brightness and colour. Yeah con contrast is Yeah okay  colour and brightness. Um and what you say  channel settings or channel programming? So you you have an option to to start scanning all the frequencies  and when it encounters one  well it shows on your T_V_. And then you can um Uh and then you can select uh a number in your remote on which you want to save it. Yeah  autoseek. Well most T_V_s automatically display the name  which they get through the cable. Yeah. So you only have to choose the position on your It only has to match the the channel frequency on your T_V_  with with the with the position on your T_V_ and and so your remote. If you already programmed it. If you want to move it. Yeah that should be possible too. Yeah how do you call that? Mm? Wait you you should be able to to browse through a list or something  which w displays all the all the values  all the channels which are possible. I mean like one to f thirty of or ninety or whatever. Just browse through it and then um in some kind of way see if it if it if it is programmed. Yeah. Swap channels. So you most of the time if you if you swap it S uh let's say for example you have uh R_T_L_ five on on channel five. And Veronica on channel eight and you want to move Veronica to channel five  um most of the times you override the previous uh the previous one. Yeah. It's it's pretty uh yeah I mean you have to look on on the menu on the T_V_. Yeah. Or or is it too hard to to ju to just do it all on your remote? To programme the channels? Uh. Yeah. No. That's true. That's true. Yeah. So we have a figure a figure out a way to to do that easily. I mean th the autoseek is is not a problem. I mean you uh you uh current channel and then then it just says  uh on which number do you want to save this  and you just press a number on your remote  and then say confirm  okay  and then it's it's saved. It's easier  it's it's it's harder to  if you have already programmed it  to to swap. So we have to think of something for that. Yeah k kind of structure into layers. So And and the layout of of the thing itself.. Maybe more on Okay. Yeah. Yeah I guess so. Yeah. Yeah. With with some l with some layers in it. So some menus. Yeah. Yeah. Well I guess this this button  the the the okay  menu okay. Or you can incorporate two uh difference uh different buttons. Uh like uh for your mobile phone. Um so this is only for to get in the menu  or to exit it. And then one to confirm  and one to go one step back. So it's like the the save button on your your mobile phone  if you have a Nokia or like that. Or the or the no button. To go one step back you it's only two extra buttons  but if it if it's very clear that they are for the screen Yeah because this this is used for both. Into your screen. Okay. So you l should leave the menu button out of here. And and just put it under the screen  the screen Yeah. But we should place the screen on top  right? Yeah. Yeah. You just you just find out and. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  or confirm and back. Whatever. Yeah. Should we save this picture  or or you know what it looks like? Yeah. That that just to to activate the screen. So And then with these buttons  woa  y you navigate. Yeah. L l litten up yeah. That's very good idea. Alright. Yeah that's a good idea because then it becomes clear which buttons are active now  which you can use. Yeah. So Those buttons are are lit up. But just one thing. Should we use those two? Them? Or only this to to scroll? And then use the two functional buttons to confirm  to go into something? Oh no we have to use this to adjust some some bars? Yeah. And maybe we should use this also as an okay button  still. And then just only a back button. Yeah? Yeah. And one back. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We have to ask. Yes. Yeah. Time pressure. Yeah we'll kick your ass later. No. Uh. Aye Y you saved it? Does it save automatically in the project folder? Or Okay. We'll see. Just put back my laptop. Alright. Yeah you can open it with the picture preview or stuff like that. internet. Alright. . It's I don't know. I didn't see it yet I think. Hey what's wrong with my computer?. Huh? What the Not really. Sorry. Okay. Where do I find this? I'm not so g display huh? Appearance? No what was it about? Yeah my computer is not functioning properly. Yeah yeah. No but my screen is reduced in size. Yeah. Feedback. Okay. This is dreadful. No not this  but the task. Yeah. No that's okay. No I just flapped it  closed it  took it here and then this happened. Ah. Uh where was it? In settings? Okay. Alright. Thank you. Do you guys like your tasks? I spent a lot of time thinking about what I was gonna do and then a couple of minutes before this I get my function you know the information that I need. So frustrating. So Yeah Yeah exactly. This presentation is mainly based on my own ideas 'cause I hadn't time to intergrate tha the information yet so Really annoying. Yeah. Ts So they do need to be in the Alright. By the way my T_V_ doesn't have an equ equaliser but okay. No. Alright. By the way where did you guys get that newsflash from? I didn't get anything. Alright. Do we have uh yeah. Alright. It's th that's the self-destruct button. Alright. Mm-hmm. And we do have to integrate the screen and the the speech alright. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Alright. Ah look. We have your uh oh never mind.. Okay. Well my presentation is a bit uh sucky. Yeah a little bit. Uh no. No no. Yeah I think that would be it then. I have no idea. That w. Let me check. I know. Yeah. Alright how do I uh skip pages? The keys yeah? Alright. Um yeah well I was working on this before I got my information. So I was just working off the top of my head and using my colin common knowledge about uh remote controls. And well the info on the website which came too late. Um so I didn't really know what kind of functions we had to put into it yet. So uh uh this is basically an overview of what we discussed in our last uh meeting. Those were my uh starting points. Uh I was working on a s yeah on a schedule  and I was supposed to do it like this. But um yeah then uh the information came and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that I had to follow  so I was trying to organise them for myself. And then make the the design  a the actual design  but I never came around to do that. So I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to say about it. I mean everything speaks for itself I guess. Mean you press a button um the it tru goes  it sends a signal to a chip  which uh translates it into infrared signal of certin spatial frequencies. And uh or temporal fr frequencies actually. And then uh through a uh transformer  it the signal gets boosted and then sent to the to the receiver on the T_V_ and the T_V_ will translate it into a function. Um Yeah well this was actually all I got around to do. I mean I dunno if I'm too slow for this stuff  but uh Yeah. Whatever. Yeah so what we might wanna do is uh yeah cust I have customised the screen functions  if you know what I mean. The uh younger users are more acquainted with these kind of machines so they can use more advanced functions. But maybe elderly people don't understand it so well  so they need a simpler remote. And yeah that you can choose what the design displays  or wha whatever. Yeah. Experienced yeah. The remote? Right top. Yeah definitely.. And might be easier huh? Yeah I Yeah exactly. I thought but this is really your department  that we need just the functional display and four cursors. And Yeah okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Why did we wanna put the display in the bottom? Okay. Because yeah if you use the functions your hand will block the display. Normal for logical t Yeah. On once it's on it's on. You don't need the power button. Yeah. Maybe on the top or even on the side. True. But if you uh if you hold the ma the remote like this  if you put it on the top on the side I dunno. Should be able to work. Never mind. Can we leave this up to you? Yeah so we we needed to integrate the sound and uh and image options right? Like uh bass uh so we need kind of an equaliser. If you Yeah treble  middl middle  bass or something. Ah as.. Yes please. the mono stereo option? And there there was something else also. And then pitch. The fr yeah the frequency of the tones  yeah. Yeah isn't that that depends on the on the signal of the of what program you're watching. And yeah in the functionality of the no no of the remote uh do do we want uh the buttons to make sound when you press them? As a confirmation or whatever you know? I dunno. Under the a yeah advanced option menu you can put those things. Yeah. But so we have we have T_V_ options  which is all this. The sound  sound and image. And you have in that uh the indeed the remote control options. So we need two menus kind of thing. Uh-huh. Alright. Help. working design. Doch. He only has to figure out how it has to look. And how to use Yeah okay. But You did your homework. But um yeah. Okay. No no. It should be able to do any remote. No. Thank god. Uh all the functional uh aspects of the remote I think are in my department. I have to know what it has to do  so if you wanna you know the changing the channels kind of s thing is  I have to integrate that in the design. Yeah. I think that's a that's a good separation. Mm. Yeah we have to kind of work together. If if I make the the the yeah the menu like  I have to state which function has to be in the menu  and then you have to decide  it's  in a in a way that b is user-friendly. Yeah. I think yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. You wanna separate uh. I think you should. It's easier. If you put too many functions in one button it gets confusing. No. Hey is it interesting for users if we put LED lights under the buttons? So that if you uh press on the menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu are ligh li light up. N Yeah and then it's also easier to integrate several functions in one button. I think not. Yeah keep it optional 'cause maybe you can you know go left to right and up and down in a in one menu. The pr the problem with the okay button in the middle is  sorry sorry  uh is uh if you're pressing up and down  you can easily press the okay once you  when you're not already at your choice. You wanna close down huh? That's okay. Already. Alright. How m how long is the lunchbreak? Okay. Mm. This is Yeah. Sorry for my uh not finished presentation uh. Bring it on. Alright. I'll try to. So first we have a lunchbreak now? Alright. Mm-hmm. I dunno where she. Hello. 'Kay. Newsflash? D did I miss something? Okay. No. Mm. I think you have to uh change your desktop uh size. computer is uh not functioning? Uh display. And then uh settings? Mm I'm not sure I. No. Okay. Format. I made uh uh my own map. It's a Yeah. Yeah. Yeah wa wa you actually Yeah. But it it's not clear what you have to to to type uh type in your presentation. Yeah. Really. Okay. Yeah. I was wondering uh But you you've got more information than uh. But where did you get uh that information? Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Mm. It's F_ five. Okay. Oh. What is this? Oh no. How do I uh No no no. I pressed the mouse button. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Um if you all go stand around uh Computer Um No. Okay. I uh had uh two examples. Um this one is the the yeah the advanced one with a lot of options and functions and buttons. This the easy one I think we have to to combine them. And uh yeah merge the best functions of all examples. Um but yeah the the age is uh under forty? So we Okay so so we have the option for more functions. Um yeah. Yeah. Uh yeah this this one we can remove for kids. It's just only for adults so uh we can uh use some advanced options. But Yeah but I prefer we we uh use the the basic options uh yeah. We have to to make them very easy so for just uh zapping around the channels you can just push one button. But if you want to to use your your video recorder or something else  you should use use an uh an advanced option. Okay one device. Okay. I didn't see. Okay and I also uh yeah. W yeah. We have to make it fashionable. Like you uh said uh before. Uh yeah the basic functions. Um yeah only use a extra function if they are really needed. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Did I uh did I break it? For for the advanced functions I think. Like searching for channels and Yeah. Okay. That's uh I'm al I'm almost finished so Um the we have to to to watch out for the i if we make it f very fashionable  it it the functional functionality will go down. So we have to make uh a compromise between functionality and fashional fashionable yeah content and form. Now that that was uh was the end. Yes. Yeah. Okay shou should we make a list of the of all the functions we want uh Yeah. But uh it's it's also for children or just uh Okay. Okay. Yeah. We we have to And if we have a larger public we have uh yeah more options to to uh sell our product. Yeah that's that's why uh I wanted to to make yeah two uh different uh yeah groups of functions. The the simple functions for for the the whole public  and the the advanced options for the younger people yeah who are more yeah experienced with uh Na I w I should uh put uh the the yeah the extra advanced options on the onto the onscreen display. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. L left top or right uh top? Yeah  right. Okay. Yeah but if you are using the the normal functions  the the basic functions  you normally press them on the u yeah. Yeah. You broke it. Yeah yeah. And volume control. Yeah. Yeah. And do we need a a logo on our uh remote control  or On the left uh top yeah. Okay. Yeah may maybe because you're Yeah okay but only for the basic functi if you're going to use the advanced option  you're going to press the the menu button and then yeah. Yeah. Okay the yeah. That's possible. Yeah  okay. Okay we put it on top. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If we Yeah it it's just a remote control so Yeah. Television uh itself uh Mm. We we could make an option for it  but uh you can disable s Yeah. But uh the the television itself has also the the options brightness and uh screen colour etcetera. So yeah. Okay. Yeah. No that's Okay On the uh yeah can you i make a a map with with all the yeah 'cause it's now there are lots and lots of documents and The the layout of the remote control? Isn't that more the the u uh the user interface part? Yeah. But do I have to to uh to yeah to make the the menu layout also? Or Are you going to do that? Yeah? I I'm going to make yeah o okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Y you you are going to make a list of what functions are uh are going to to be on the the screen  the menu screen. And I'm going to make a a nice menu uh with with pages and yeah. Yeah. Yeah. W we Uh I think we have to to group  to make two groups. Um the one group for the for the display  and one group for the basic functions  and Yeah okay but we we have a m yeah but maybe that's that's not uh yeah if you're if you're z zapping uh with your uh yeah remote control  you can press the the menu button  and then you are suddenly into the the yeah the display. Yeah. Yeah j just just group group the yeah we make these the advanced functions and these the basic functions. So we make a yeah a line between them. F oh yeah. Okay yeah we swap uh Okay. Yeah. So we make it a Okay. Uh Yeah. So we have a a menu button and a s Okay. Okay and back button. Yeah I'm I'm not s clear about uh the the extra two buttons. We have a menu button and That's the the one with the yeah okay. Okay. Okay so that that's not uh Yeah that Those are multifunctional. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No Yeah. So maybe make one uh one okay button and and one navigation button. Yeah the with with the the channel and the volume uh yeah m a multifunctional navigation button. Yeah okay. Yeah. But do we have to write uh to write down uh the our stuff now? Or first lunchbreak? Because I I've everything in my head now so Okay. Yeah. 'Kay. Yeah. Yes sir. Oh no no. Okay. And uh we have to make uh some maps with uh with the all the the data we uh gathered.. It's it's just my own map so I put everything into the But you got some extra information uh Okay. But where do you did you get the newsflash? You're the only one uh okay. Okay. Yeah. ,The marketing expert reported on research which shows that users think most remotes are ugly  easily lost and bad for RSI. Audio settings are rarely used  and the power  channel and volume buttons are used most often. The remote should be user-friendly and have a good look and feel. The marketing expert and project manager described the new requirements that the target group is users under 40  the remote should not include teletext  should be only for TV  and should feature the corporate logo. The user interface designer showed examples of two contrasting remotes  recommending that they should use the best features of both. The group decided to use an LCD screen and speech recognition. The industrial designer described how a remote works  and explained that his presentation was incomplete because he had not received the necessary information in time. The group discussed what functions to include and the layout of the remote  and the marketing expert drew a possible design on the board. They decided to have buttons for the basic functions and make the advanced functions accessible through the screen. They also discussed what buttons would be needed to navigate the menu on the LCD screen. 
Okay. So  now um  last time. Can you uh push the button? One time please. So I'm still the secretary. Now uh  I ask you to presentate the prototype. One of your you two. Yes. The prototype. Well  thank you. Uh  now Yes. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. And the buttons? And the joystick is for the volume and the channels. Okay  so if joystick and L_C_D_. What's the R_R_ d Okay. Very good. So  we have So  what they say on the side is put fashion there. Yes. It's good. So  that's it. That's prototype. Now  the finance. We don't know if it's th it if it's okay. So  I'm gonna look. We have Sorry? Finance is um Yeah it's No  first uh Yes. We have to evaluate the product yet. Sorry. Criteria. No  it's okay. Oh  it's okay. What do you think? Yeah. Two. You? Me too. So it's a three. So it's a Yes  it's for the younger g group. So it's uh half half of the people. So I think it's four. No. Yes. So  I think it's four. Okay. Give it a four. Yep. We put the fashion in electronics. Uh  I say uh a five. It's not fashion  it's new. It must be a fashion. But it isn't. Yes. It w If it's not a fashion we can put it in it. So  it must be a fashion. I think it's a five. No. Oh. I use my feet though. Okay. Well  I say three. So  counting then is two and a half. Okay  two. You? Me too. One. Next  six. It does not get lost easily. No  we did not. So  but can it get lost if it's such a thing? I don't think so. Yes. Not a not a normal shapes. So No. It won't get lost. So A one? Okay  a one. Next. Yeah me That was our target. Two. Yep. Right. There's a fancy look-and-feel. Okay. I say a two. It's a a bit personal. If it's fancy. So I think s two is better. No  it's new. Innovation.. Okay. Me too. Three. Yeah. Effort is three  ten and twelve. Thirty  forty  fifty . Twenty one. So  it's uh two and three nine two and one third. Yep. Uh  nah. Okay. So  it's good. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Back to my uh Yep. Next please. So  now uh we have a product. Very happy. But uh  is it cheap enough? Um  so if uh I'll have a look. We have a battery. One battery. Okay  one battery. Electronics. Advanced chip. Yeah it's the most advanced. Chip-on-print. We have that one. We have the simple  regular and advanced. We have the adva advanced. 'Kay  so uncurved or flat. Nope. Single curved or double curved? We have double curved. So Then we have plastic  wood  rubber. we have half rubber  half plastic. No titanium. Special colour. Yes  yellow. Interface  push-button. Scroll-wheel  integrated scroll-wheel push push-button  or L_C_D_ display. So  we have the L_C_D_ We have two scroll-wheels? Or one? And it's not really a s Yeah  it's this one. Now  uh button supplement. Special colour. We already Uh  that's the from the for the buttons. The buttons are regular colour. So  then uh then then then then then then Then Uh  no. It's too expensive. So  we have to change something. Fifteen Euros. Yeah  well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel  it's okay. 'Cause we can't lose the battery. We can't lose the advanced chip. We can't lose the double curve. We have rubber  special colour. Oh  no  we No  it's uh Sorry? Um  then we uh lose two Euros. Then we have thirteen Euros. Half a Euro too much. Exactly the special colours. So That's one Euro. So  I don't think that's good. Mm I think we have to keep the L_C_D_. If Yes. Then it's only thirteen Euros. So uh yeah. Yeah. Then you have Or you have to cut this off. Then it's not good anymore. So  wait. Okay. I'll have a look. We Yellow rubber. Yeah  normal. Uh One minute  please. Uh Is it maximum. Um Yeah  it's normal colour. But if you lose the joystick  it's still uh an advanced chip? Or it's then a regular? So  the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick. And what if we lose the L_C_D_? Yeah  regular chip. But Is it a good design? Mm  yes. Then it's okay. Okay  so no joystick. Oh no  but we then we get push-buttons from half a Euro. Uh  yes  yes  yes  yes. No joystick. Push-buttons. No special colour. Twelve and a half Euros. Then it's okay. So  we have to change that a little bit. And you cannot use the red and green button. Because if you give them a s uh colour  you have to pay point two Euros. Yes. Yes. So So Well Now we have to change that  but that's okay. Rubber. What's the normal colour? So And Where's? Yeah. So  now it's Yeah. It is. But then it will be just that ones. Now it's Very good. Now  uh project eva evaluation. Well What do you think of it? Uh About the project. Okay. And you. Okay. Okay. Well  what do I have to say. I think it was good. Not too many discussions. So  it's good for the speed. So  I think we're ready. Good price. Evaluation ready. Ready. That's it. Oh this  you mean? Yes  well uh this is it. It's uh it's uh it's yellow. And uh  this is rubber. And and and this too. The the sides. And the rest is hard plastic. And uh We uh we had some uh We had a new idea that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside. And then it covers the these buttons until here or something. And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick. So  you can still operate uh all the things. Because you don't always use the menu. And then it can break. Uh  well uh Big buttons. And everything is blue  except the power button. And the mute. Of uh yeah  and the mute and the the other button. Yeah. Channel higher channel button. Uh  yes. Yes  that's uh Very obvious. Yeah. R_R_'s the l the the the the company uh logo. Uh  yes. Yes. That's about here. Oh. Three. Mm Mm  four. Yeah  but it's it's Yeah. I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons. So I mean  the colours are for young people  but older Yeah. Yeah. Maybe. Yes. Two. Then make it th three.. Yes  a one. I like it. One. Yes. Yeah  but uh Yeah. Yeah. Yes  a one. Yeah  okay. Mm  three. Yes. Mm-hmm. Mm  yes. Mm  yeah. Mm  yeah. Yeah. Okay. All the same uh Mm  yeah. Recognisable. Like what Yeah. Mm  yeah. Okay. Yeah  well the same. I I espe I especially uh liked the the means  the the SMARTboard and uh Yeah  it uh It brings up new ideas when you work with uh with it. Yeah. Mm-hmm. No.. I don't care. Huh? Big.. Yes. Up is channel up. Down is channel down. To the right is volume up. To the left is volume down. The R_R_? I'll get it. I think the scroll-button is something also uh new. What uh not anoth uh  not a lot of uh a lot of uh remote controls have. I think technologically I'll give it an seven. Si six six. Sorry  six. Oh  true or false. Oh  uh I'll I'll give it uh a t a two. Sorry. Five. Mm-hmm. Maybe version uh three point O_ uh has other colours. Four. Me too a two  because only the battery is not uh techin uh technologically high standard. But the rest of it is. So  I think a two. It it will be fashion. 'Kay. Three is okay. Oh  we'll wait outside. I give it a one. Say two. Two. One. Uh Just a small thing. Ah. Yellow. Looks like a pistol. Uh It won't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch. Uh Yeah  o one. Yeah. Me too. Two. Yeah? Yeah. I gave this a one because of the rubber. It feels soft. Uh  it looks like a l uh uh b uh  a bit like a joystick. It's Yeah. Yeah  f very fancy trendy. Two is okay.. Oh. I go for two because uh the the shapes are still round. Uh  the latest trends are soft things  you know  like uh I said in my presentation. Uh But the the colours are um basic  like yellow  red  um blue. Something what also younger people want. It's also a trend  so I'll give it a two. Two. Yeah  I think. Cheapest there is. Expensive. Well  it's the most advanced. Advanced. Uh  yellow. One. Joystick uh thing. We're not gonna make it. Yeah. Wh What what are the costs? Fifteen. A special colour. Uh  I don't think it's a very special colour. Yellow? Uh  is it a special colour? What? Yeah. And what if we use only one sort of um Um just only plastic or only rubber? One Euro discount. If we change the joyst uh the joystick thing into a button up  button down  button right  button left. And then we'll lose fifty cent in what? Uh uh-uh. No. And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour it's a normal colour  wh No one will see it. Normal colour  and the the joystick away  and put the button up  button down  right  left. And it's twelve Euros  I think. No. Uh  no  no  no. Uh Oh  wait wait wait. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah  yeah. If we lose the L_C_D_  then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_. Uh  yeah. Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television. And you don't have the L_C_D_. So  the T_V_s has to uh have to be up-to-date. Yeah. Yeah. Huh. No knew that. Yeah  then it's twelve Euro fifty  then it's okay. So  all the buttons has to have to be the same colour. But then the print on it will g um change it. Make it uh for everybody to see what button it is. Uh l How you call it? Recognisable  yeah. Yeah? Okay. Oh  well that's clear. And the joystick away. And its buttons. Yeah. About the process. Went good. Uh I think uh the creativity uh was good enough. We have a gun instead of a remote control. Um Uh leadership. Yeah  you were the project project manager  and uh had the final vote. So yeah that was clear. Team-work okay. Everybody uh has something uh to say about it. And uh no  uh o only the the drawing uh was very difficult. But  nah. New ideas found. Nope. No. Yep. Beer. Yeah? Okay then. This is it. Yes. Yeah. That's on the rub rubber part. Yeah? Alright. Do we Do we change the Do we change the the order? Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first? Okay. That's uh um That can be none. Um  we gonna do the evaluation now  together. But I have uh a introduction how it works. So  it will come up. Uh-oh. Okay. Um  yeah. Well  we uh uh  I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias  uh based on um our marketing strategy  on uh the latest trends  on user preferences. Uh  we have a seven point scale from uh true  as well. To false  seven? And on base of each c uh criteria  we need to um give a rating. We can uh Well  it look like this. But we gonna uh do it here  they said. So  you hope found out how to do it with a Word document. Yeah. Okay  yeah. Yeah. Um  well uh we have the Word document You So we open up that blank here. Um Think I can Uh  what this just an example. So  this not very important. But um  if I can get a number in here. Hmm. Well  uh we can't do that. Um  so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative. Uh  and then we have to uh agree on the rating together. And in the end  we will c uh count an average of all rating. The first uh on each item. Yeah  I think it's uh Uh  well technologically using  it's not uh it doesn't contain many new features. Only the L_C_D_. So  it Um  I think I will give it a yeah  yeah  yeah  a four. Hmm. So now i I think you uh see it um its statement. And you true or false. And true is one. So  yeah. Yeah. 'Kay. Um  well It's a one. The first item. So  okay the second item. Um  this product is for all sorts of customers. Well  it's a statement which uh I disagree with  because we uh really aim uh at at young market and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow  it's not uh really aimed for all customers. It doesn't look like that. That's uh a six. Four. Uh  okay. Mm. That's uh the motto of our company. Yeah  well do we do this with uh this product? I um Yeah. I think if we do this  as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design. Um  so I would give it a two. Two. Uh Okay. Okay. Yes  I'll think of that too. Yeah  agree? A three. Yeah okay. The next element um is the product looks good. Well personally  I do not prefer a um remote control that's fully in yellow. So  I would give this a five. We have to do our uh Two or three? Two. Okay. So  well we gonna do the next part. Uh  yep. Uh uh  the next statement. It has not too much buttons. Um  yeah  I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better. And in the end we calculate an average. So  um that's why it's a negative in it. Um  well this one of our aims not have too much buttons. So  um uh did we uh do that? Well  uh if we go to uh this fashion  I We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers. But you can you can go for that. And um that way  you don't have a lot of buttons over. So  I would give this a two. One. Um  but where where is the? So Yeah  did we implement uh the sound? Yeah. It won't. One. Okay  um well we aimed for the younger market. Uh yeah  did we achieve that. I think with the way it looks and um it is designed  I will give it a two. Yeah. Uh  yes. That that was uh  yeah  one of the most important things that uh Trendwatch said. I didn't uh say it in my presentation. But um  well does it have that? I would say yes. So um Well  let's also give this a two. T Yeah. Okay. Two. And um  then the last one I could think of  uh it goes with the latest trends. If we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people  and they ate uh fruit and vegetables  well it has a um a nice colour  uh well compared to food but we didn't uh We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that. So  I would did not give this uh a one or two. I We'll go for a three. Yes. A three. Okay. So um  come back to the presentation now. So  we find yourself there  and now we have to calculate an average rating. So  we will do that. Yes. By nine. Yeah. Um  uh okay. Two. Come on. So uh  that's a pretty low rating  I think. So  according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job. Oh. Nah. How am I doing? Yes. And I closed your slide-show. Which one was the last for you? Uh  dreaming. Next. Finance. Yeah. One... We would have uh n For a remote control. I've For a remote control  I think it is. If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick. For up down left right. The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ wasn't it? If uh If we have the n no buttons If we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons  we would have uh  we have thirteen Euros? And then uh we move the the colour. What will that be? Yeah. still  he waited at the No. Project. Yeah  I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices. I think um Well  the laptops if you have them out front of you  you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation. Um  well uh the draw-board  well you can draw things. But it not really going very convenient. Uh  maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor and uh you would also see there. And with a normal mouse. Um  and uh the project. Yeah  I agree on what was said uh mainly. Uh  yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others. And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking. To tell their opinion. Yeah. Okay. ,The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team members and then the team members participated in an exercise in which they drew their favorite animal and discussed what they liked about the animal. The project manager talked about the project finances and selling prices. The team then discussed various features to consider in making the remote. 
Think we can first. Right. I just wanna 'cause basically I can't re I've really crap at remembering everyone's name so I just wanna rather than going uh Miss Marketing and Miss this and Miss that wanted to know your names again. just gonna leave this up here 'cause I'll you know. So Okay  and Gabriel. E_L_ is it? 'Kay. And you're s r R_E_I_S_S_ Okay. 'S just a bit nicer calling people by their names I think. Uh  right. Okay  right  welcome to meeting B_. Um this is gonna go a lot better than the last meeting  basically  uh 'cause I know what I'm supposed to be doing now. I am your Project Manager  and  uh yeah  I'm just here to sort of liaise between the three of you and get things going  get people talking and and I'm gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically. Um right  this for the purposes of this meeting what this meeting is all about is um I'm gonna have some presentations from all three of you  what you've been working on for the last wee while  when you haven't been getting hit with spam on your computers and and  you know  filling out silly questionnaires and things. But hopefully you've been actually been doing something productive. So we're gonna each of you gonna give us a litt a little presentation. Um. Then we're gonna work  you know  from each of your presentations. We'll we'll uh talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all. Um and then we'll  yeah  we'll sort of conclude anything else comes up at the end of it. This meeting it's not very long. It's uh probably down to about thirty five minutes now. So I want each of your presentations to not be too long  five five minutes  something like that. Um if you haven't done a PowerPoint thingy  it doesn't matter  it it just it just says that you it's that's just one particular medium. If you haven't had time to prepare one  you can draw stuff on the noteboard  you can talk to us  you can you know however you want to do your little presentation  basically  you can. Don't feel pressurised into using this thing. 'Cause I don't. Uh okay. So um. You okay over there? Reissa  are you uh b are you joining in with this meeting here or are y or are y or are you are you just are you just uh doing some Internet shopping there? Okay  jolly good. Alright  let's have um well  we all know that it's it's a remote control that we're gonna be dealing with. I think the first thing we should look at is um probably the um what it is that it is actually supposed to be. So that's gonna be you Catherine  if we wanna hear from you first. You don't have to worry about screwing it in just there you go. Ah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Great. Okay. I prefer the pe I prefer the human touch personally. Yeah. Do you wanna just give us a moment  I just wanna copy this down. Um I dunno if you guys have got any questions for Catherine on any of this? Yeah  you blow on it and i Yeah  it's worked for the last fifty years you know. How far away is your television? It's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be  you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch  it's not doesn't have to go that far  does it? Doesn't have to go through a wall  because you're not gonna be looking through a wall. Yeah  yeah I d it sounds like you you w don't wanna overcomplicate things. You know we don't need it. Yeah  exactly. Basically  we're we're desi we're designing and marketing a television remote control unit. We're not w w w w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff. It's uh Okay. Right  well done  Catherine. Um Gab Gabriel let's uh let's hear from you on on on such things. Mm-hmm. Mm yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Great. Yeah. Great. Okay. Now that's I just have a q a q question for you. This w um research that you've been doing looki looking at other  you know  existing units stuff. Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or Yeah. Yeah. Um I would say it's If it's simple to do  which I think it probably should be  even if it's a physical  you know  a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote  even something like that  um then yes  it's like  you know  like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing  something like that  but you know being physical. Look into. Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred well  something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit. It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_. You know  the the company it's it's  from what I can see from our other products  are yellow with blue writing on them. Um. We put the fashion in electronics. There you go. So it's kinda gotta look it's gotta look new and s you know something fashionable. If if remote control well  if telephones can be fashionable  then maybe remote control units can be. Yeah. Because we need Yeah. Great. Okay  fantastic. Right  well done  Gabriel. Um Reissa. Let's plug you in  baby. Yeah  w it it just takes a wee while. 'Cause we've only got five channels. I think that's k flicking quickly between channels. Yeah. Wow. You are a child of technology  aren't you? So there you go  yeah. Uh but do the younger generation have the money? They they don't. It's older generation  they're the ones that have gone out and People people from the age of thirty f there's a big drop off there. For people up to the age of thirty five  you're kinda saying  yeah  they want it. Um but no they're not sort of most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five  uh 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years. Um d and tha and that's a that's quite a minority there  so yeah  it's not even like fifty fifty that's th thirty five per cent. Yeah. I would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off. So y so it's so it's so you got so that's something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of see have a look if um there's any w any medical background we can find out about this. Let's jus we just want need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time  say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury. Yeah. They're having a lunch break at the moment  but yeah. I'll see if I can get see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting. Yeah. Okay. That's great  thank you very much for that  Reissa. Um okay  so we've basically we've decide we've d we've decided that it's gonna be  you know uh  we're going for a basic television remote. It's gotta be safe to use  it's gotta look cool. It's gotta be cheap. S um. Now going back to the uh industrial design of it  you know  we were looking at whether to use maybe infra-red or Bluetooth. I think  we should just go with the simplest option on everything  uh and that would be infra-red  energy source  that would be batteries. Uh mean we we can look into using the s  you know  the little tiny weeny batteries  all like special long-lasting batteries. Um. But a in there's no I don't think there's any point in making a remote control unit that's gonna last for fifty years  because technology will have changed and  you know  we won't have televisions in ten years' time. So I think we're all um pretty sussed on that. Um anyone have any questions? Everybody happy in their work? Now this is good  we've got a good structure going on. We all know where we're going to. Have you been ge has have any of you lot been getting loads of crap spam on your computers? Yeah. Yeah  stuff. Um okay. Do oh have you guys found out if we can if we can e-mail stuff to each other? Right. Do all you all know my e-mail address? Can you all d e-mail me your e-mail addresses?. Send me  yeah yeah  okay. Is it yellow and black or is it yellow and blue? I I kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background  but I might be just going a bit Okay. Well  maybe you can come up with a few with a couple of different ideas? Well  see the thing is is we've gotta keep the company image. It's gotta say people have gotta look at this remote control and instantly recognise that it's a Real Reaction i product. There's loads of companies that called R_R_. This is slog but this is the slogan  this is the the the the type. Yeah. Well  not necessarily. But we have to incorporate it. Not necessarily even if i it just has to ye but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products as opposed to a Sony product or a  you know  a Panasonic product. It's got to so maybe  so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein  perhaps. Yeah. Yeah. Quite poss yeah. Well this is all your department. Mm okay. Well  well done everybody. And um  I think we uh stop for lunch now. We might possibly have done. If we've if we've finished at five minutes before the meeting's supposed to finish  then that means we get an extra five minutes for lunch. Yeah  there you go. Right. I just have to there's a few little bits and pieces I have to write down  but Take your headsets off  kick back  smoke 'em if you got 'em. Right it was function F_ eight or something. This one right there. Okay. Think we all Huh. Oh I thought we all were. Yeah  I have one too  okay. S Whoops I forgot to put the thing on Okay. Yeah. Sure  that's a good idea. Uh Gabriel. E_L_. Think she's finishing up her presentation. Oh. Yeah  alternate energy source  like win wind power or Bicycle power. One question I have  and I don't know how much control we have over this is um  as far as the infra-red signal  do we have control over  you know  how far away you can be from the receiving unit  the the T_V_  and still have it be operational? I mean  maybe we want one with a strong signal stream. Uh That's true. Okay. Uh I'm just gonna use the PowerPoint uh. Technical. Okay. Okay  so  while this is warming up  there it is uh. So I'm doing the user interface design. Yeah  and basically uh  as far as methods  I was I was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes  trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there. Thinking of what we can retain  what we can do away with  uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um. we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change  I guess  I mean people want a remote that's familiar  that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics  but Um so we can improve what's out there and maintain that  the basic functionality that people want. Um so things that seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control  um so up-down keys for that  uh channel keys up-down  but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want  rather than doing up-down  and uh a mute button. Uh one thing that I didn't include here  that I forgot that we talked about last time  was doing um some sort of lock uh function. Uh  I don't I dunno  uh that's one possibility. And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes  ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred  which I don't know if I can access the web page from here  but I can show you uh. Yeah. So this is a engineer centred one  so you see it's rather busy  but it also lets you play your movie  stop your movie  fast-forward  all this  um freeze frame. Uh and this is a user centred one. Uh it's it's easier to g just glance at this and see what's possible to do  you're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes. And I judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after  uh or the direction we were going in at least. Um. So  the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality  but it can be a little bit overwhelming  so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use. Uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh  Reissa  because uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this. So uh  yeah  that's me. No that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know. I mean obviously another exists like you like you said in in mobile phones. That was sort of the inspiration for it. Um I've never seen that with in in all my years in in the remote business. I've  haven't I've never seen a locking functionality. I dunno  what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that a feeling about whether that's really necessary? Yeah. Mm-hmm. 'Kay. Right. Mm. Right. And our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics. I think I think we have to carry that mental. Mm. Well yeah these  I think  we can so we talked about the layout in my presentation and what I didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design. I t I think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here  I mean. Uh  everything is going t ergonomic  you know  there's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market  I guess. Um.. Yeah. Uh  yeah  this is getting all. Mm. Yeah  then you just have to do function F_ eight and it should come up. Yeah  it just takes a second uh. Yeah  you wanna navigate the channels quickly I guess. Mm. No I would I would say the older the older people  yeah. Yeah  that would be my guess as well. What about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost? I mean if if it's twelve fifty per unit. I mean  okay  there's Uh. Repetitive strain uh rep repetitive strain injury or like from doing Mm. Mm. Yeah  we should probably consult with our legal department uh. Yeah. I think we can do some really in in that department  the the ergonomic department  we can make some some really good improvements. Mm. Yeah  it seems like we're all on the pretty much on the same page. Oh it's probably just you  'cause you're the project manager. Sell trying to sell your things. Okay. No I don't. I Uh Oh  it's just participant one oh okay. Yeah. Well it's just w it's just it's just par participant one  participant two. So are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as maybe that's our next meeting that we discuss that. Well  it's like white on i white and blue on a black background with white with yellow borders. Maybe that's like getting ahead of ourselves. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. And this is something that came on down from from the higher ups  so  I mean  we are sort of beholden to them. Not one colour  but the pattern needs to be recognisable.. Yeah  pretty soon I think  I guess that's now. Alright  see you all soon. . I am Reissa. R_E_I_S_S_A_. Double S_ A_  yeah yeah. Sorry. Mm 'kay. Mm. I'm fine. Yeah. I uh yeah  yeah. D I mean  I I'm finishing off my presentation. No no. Uh I'm done. Okay. Mm. Is a battery like the only way of No  no No I meant like No 'cause like cha 'cause always changing um um batteries can get like annoying. The battery's down and maybe  I dunno  solar charged? Mm. Yeah. Yeah  but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the put the telephone down  and go into the other room. How about Bluetooth? Instead of using infra-red  use Bluetooth. Isn't that a better signal? Mm. Mm. 'S just an idea. Adjusting. Yeah. Mm.. Mm. Mm. Mm. Okay.. Where does it go into? Here? The blue thing.. Well  function F_ eight. No oh. Come on. Right. Okay.. Okay. Well  for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab  and also gave so this is research and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out. Um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know  so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings. So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly. Okay  so they don't like the look of the remote control. Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy. So I think we all agree with that. Um current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user. So  they don't like like the way they operate it doesn't like match how people behave. Um per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote  so probably if you have like one  two  three  four  five  the whole up to z ten  they probably don't use those  they only use the up and down channel. exactly. That's another thing. Um seventy five per cent of users say they zap. Not quite sure what they mean  zap  goes like. Yeah. Mm. Um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote. I think especially for uh the older generation. I know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones  takes ages to work how to use. Anyway um and they also remotes often get lost in the room  so nobody can find them. So maybe tracking devices is a good idea. Um personal preferences. Um so yeah um I was thinking something easy to use  especially for older people. Um has to look really cool  flashy groovy for people to buy it. And it's easy to find  so I don't know whether maybe and also we asked them whether they wanted whether they'd be interested in um voice activating. So voice activation. So and this was what we came up with. Then if you look fifteen to twenty five this is age  sorry  age groups. So fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two ninety one per cent of them said yes. Um so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one. And neither did the older generation  but the younger generation who we are catering for  like who have most of the money nowadays  do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote. Well the twenty five to thirty five year old  and thirty five  and the thirty five to forty five  forty five point seven per cent say no  so So they don't Well These guys are growing up. Voice activation might not be the best. Um also with um with buttons  a thing called R_S_I_  so wrist sense Huh? Yeah  repetitive strains injury  so they don't I think people who watch T_V_ maybe too often  keep changing channel hurts their wrist. I don't think so. Yeah maybe not so hard. Yeah. Maybe Mm. Yeah. Mm. Maybe th the buttons not so high up so you don't have to press so much  or we just like flat buttons  something. Yeah. So that is me. Mm. Mm. Mm. Well  just questionnaires. Yeah  you can. I think he's participant one  aren't you? Can't we have different colours in the remotes  so somebody can choose different col like does it have to be of a certain? But if it's a R_R_  it would be Real Reaction  like if it had a symbol on it. Whoa. So we have to have it one colour. Mm. Mm. Mm. Are we are we finished ahead of schedule? 'Kay uh. Mm. Tha Okay. Who is gonna do a PowerPoint presentation? You will as well? Okay. Yep. Okay I'm Okay. I'm Catherine with a C_. C_A_T_H_ E_R_ I_N_E_. Right. True. How long is the meeting? Okay. No problem. Okay. Okay. Um just connecting this. Are we getting i Really? Okay. Cool. Okay. So I've got a very quick uh Uh. Okay. So the working design  I've got a very quick presentation on this  so um I've oh no  you can't see a thing. Oh well  I'm gonna draw it on the board then. It's in blue uh  and I couldn't change it. We it's fine on my screen  but never mind. So um the idea is that we've got the energy source um  which in our case will pr  oh well okay  never mind. So um I think maybe uh two batteries  I dunno what they're called six  or something like that. Uh and then um then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal  which could be uh an infra-red signal  um which will be sent by an electronic chip. And uh the chip will be controlled by the user interface. So we'll hear about that later from Gabriel. And uh the sender will send to the telly itself an infra-red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels. Um and that's it really for the working design. Sorry the presentation wasn't very uh clear but Really? Cool. Um  should I erase this or Okay. Fine. Or suggestions? Well  it's just  you don't want it plugged in really  s In indoors. I dunno  swi I th I th I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain  but Yeah. Well  the thing is uh you you don't Well  we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it. I didn't think about that but Why not? I just think that it's it's gonna cost more and I'm I'm not sure it's you're gonna use it. It's a fancy idea uh it's quite nice  but then I don't th I dunno  either you if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room  you are gonna But Oh  we can we can keep the idea if you i We can see at a later stage  maybe  I don't Do you need the border? Okay. Sorry. Well maybe they shouldn't watch so much T_V_ then. Maybe it could be  instead of pressing button it could be just touching a Yep.. Well  in the project announcement  you've got the addresses  I think. So Project Manager  it's participant one at A_M_I_. You have them i you have them  but we'll send you an e-mail. You want to have friends  don't you? It wouldn't be Well you could It could come But it could come in different colours and have the R_R_ colours just somewhere like just around the lock button could be the R_R_ logo or colours and If. Cool. ,The project manager opened the meeting and introduced the project  describing what the project would involve  the role of each participant and the agenda for the first meeting. He the demonstrated the equipment the group would be using  and the group practiced using the SMARTboard by drawing their favourite animals. The project manager then went over the project budget. The industrial designer gave a brief presentation about his role and his initial ideas for the project  suggesting that the remote should be used for multiple devices and that the group should consider using bluetooth rather than infrared. The project manager then asked the others about their initial ideas. The user interface designer agreed that the remote should control multiple devices. They also discussed having glow in the dark buttons  using bluetooth instead of infrared and using a display and/or a joystick instead of conventional buttons. However  they were unsure about what the budget would allow. The project manager suggested that the remote should be rechargeable or not use much power  but this might be difficult if using bluetooth. The project manager closed the meeting.
