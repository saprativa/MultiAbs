Project Manager: And product evaluation.,1
"Marketing: Try it, yeah maybe.",0
"Project Manager: I mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it, so, you know.",1
"User Interface: And basically it depends like the remote with LCD display for browsing because you have multiple functionalities for example you are watching a movie, you are having a universal remote control, you want to you do not know really which functionality is now, so I am using the TV so every time I use it, it could be like, for example I can use a simple toggle switch, a display, so I press it so the display says, I'm in TV or DVD or whatever it is, instead of having three keys separately for four keys,",1
Project Manager: Maybe you can look how much it is for the LCD.,0
"Industrial Designer: I think controlling is not the right word, I think the interactions are very structured.",1
Project Manager: They cost us all the same.,0
"Industrial Designer: May fail though, every here, there.",1
"Project Manager: So big buttons, flashy design, maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing.",1
Project Manager: It does not tell me.,0
"Industrial Designer: I do not think there is a sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a, like a consensus right, we go around, we think about it,",1
Industrial Designer: is that a function we want in the remote?,0
Marketing: Same sort of function? The criteria? It is alright.,0
Project Manager: let me see.,0
Industrial Designer: Something what also younger people want.,1
User Interface: do not use my opinion.,0
Industrial Designer: to something which is maybe more universal.,1
Project Manager: Right well this is the kickoff meeting for our project.,0
Marketing: Let is go on then.,0
User Interface: Like you said before.,0
"Marketing: we can make it brown, dark brown, not wood.",1
Project Manager: I think it is not too expensive.,0
Marketing: You had different remote controls for different devices.,1
"Marketing: but ninety one percent, fifteen to twenty five.",1
Marketing: So we can launch it.,1
Project Manager: so I will I let David Jordan do his presentation.,0
"Industrial Designer: The second version is also simpler, we d we had just I have to put the microphone also.",1
Industrial Designer: So at least seven to seven.,0
"Marketing: We could make things much more f I think the eighty percent of people would spend more on a remote that looks better, combined with decrease the or take out the limited functio functions that we do not really use much.",0
Project Manager: And would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition?,1
"Marketing: Like I do not know if they would actually go out, purchase this themselves, a fifteen year old you know.",1
Project Manager: but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer.,0
Project Manager: what is a hand dynamo?,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, two years' time this will be on the market.",0
Project Manager: I would say a two.,1
Project Manager: let is call this to an end.,0
"Marketing: One is fancy look, second is innovative, third is easy to use.",1
Industrial Designer: So maybe there is like a set design which we get printed off.,0
"Project Manager: But you do mention the next, previous button.",0
"Marketing: normally you only every use, you know, on a TV remote you only ever use, mostly, you know, f four or f six buttons.",1
"Industrial Designer: Why would you put it then, where is the recording the microphone?",0
"User Interface: No, tha that w that w that would be more promising.",0
"Marketing: So maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use, trendy, fancy, feels good, with a display, wood, designer wood, designer colours.",1
Marketing: ease of use.,1
Project Manager: I'm gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders.,1
"Marketing: Yeah but you know the average frequency of pushing buttons, it is about.",0
"Project Manager: Twelve, a half Euros is what supposed to cost us.",0
User Interface: You have to do it over.,1
Project Manager: But remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the.,0
Industrial Designer: I'm the Industrial Designer.,1
"Project Manager: Right, we are gonna try out the electronic whiteboards.",0
"Marketing: Because we decided to have two kind of remotes, two designs, or was it two colours?",1
"Marketing: Hey, what what is the company colour? Did you get told what the company colour is or.",0
User Interface: like it is just been brought up again then.,0
User Interface: So you so you move to the next the next one.,1
Industrial Designer: Or we can do something like that.,1
Project Manager: Thank you very much.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five,",1
User Interface: We will not use this.,1
Industrial Designer: and discuss it in the next meeting.,0
"User Interface: So you generally see rectangular shape, very monotonous kind of designs here.",1
"Industrial Designer: Because we have tried to make it a little bit innovative,",0
"Marketing: So, I would give this a five.",1
User Interface: what is the purpose of the light?,0
Project Manager: I do not see any power cables here so.,0
Project Manager: Because we have to decide this.,0
"Project Manager: we want it to be original, something that is people have not thought of, that is not out in the shops, trendy, appealing to a wide market, but you know, not a hunk of metal, userfriendly, grannies to kids, maybe even pooches should be able to use it.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, a little bit.",1
Industrial Designer: I'm just thinking totally different designs also.,1
Project Manager: It is the little blue w it is the one th.,0
User Interface: and would cost us to build it about eight Euros.,0
Project Manager: So we need to calculate the production cost.,1
Marketing: Yeah but if you shape it.,0
Marketing: fifty percent I think of all these nbers the most important is fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons.,1
Industrial Designer: Fr I mean the never mind.,0
"Project Manager: but if we all have a think, when we go away from the meeting, what specific things could be included in this remote control that are out of the ordinary.",1
"Marketing: Well I have noticed that gaming c is becoming quite popular with television, when I was younger we used to e play games using our cable, using the cable subscribed the cable providers,",1
"Industrial Designer: I thought but this is really your department, that we need just the functional display, four cursors.",1
"Industrial Designer: This is incremental, but once you press it for a long time, you go five by five.",1
"Project Manager: I have got I think we should also have a backup plan of I 'cause I just think that it might be expensive to make something that I mean we do not, we have not been told it has to be something that will control everything.",0
Project Manager: that pen drawings.,0
"Project Manager: It is actually a novel thing because you could sell it a as a novelty, just to be actually serious for a minute here,",0
Project Manager: I think it was better to have this price list a bit earlier.,1
Marketing: It is your it is your job.,0
Project Manager: Yeah such as maybe the.,0
Marketing: Yeah e power supply is one of the most important things.,1
Project Manager: Or we can put these in the project folder as well.,0
"Marketing: No, it you did better.",1
"Marketing: And then it kinda there was a green, I think it was a green ring, there was like red going out like this.",0
Marketing: criteria four is costs.,1
"Project Manager: Yeah, the project is evaluated.",0
User Interface: but these are these are all necessary functions.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yes, but when you put that same volt voltages on it, you can put when the when the when o the lowest part of it, when it is o the same as the other products, you can put it all on the same.",1
"User Interface: the distance from your television to your remote control has to be, yeah yeah, quite a big distance.",1
"Marketing: they have like a touch screen with really big pictures on it like call hangup, that is a big ad advantage I think, because one the one hand you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by scaling up the pictures or something.",1
"Marketing: I guess the other option, referring to the battery thing is, you know how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds or something, when you are s, then it goes,",1
"User Interface: about yeah like yeah, a bit like radio presets.",0
"User Interface: You need to change channels, both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing.",1
Marketing: you only have channel button or volume button.,1
User Interface: Programming them can be a right pain.,1
"User Interface: in writing letters, of course, yeah? Yeah, normally, this the w Block letter sign it, yeah?",0
"User Interface: I mean there are there are advantages, disadvantages if you if you have an LCD display, it is nice, because it is it lets you just sort of sit there, st, control your television from your armchair.",0
Marketing: building games like Snake or Tetris to amuse the younger users.,1
User Interface: It is just a bird.,0
"Project Manager: The sample sensor, for speak recognition anyway.",0
"User Interface: 'Cause we have brought it down to basically four controls most common, which are channel, volume.",0
"Industrial Designer: So or maybe set it out in the sun, it, you know, gets, from the light, a solar cell inside there.",1
Project Manager: I will delete this one now because we do not use it yet.,0
"Industrial Designer: But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control, because it will just lie there for a long while sometimes.",1
Marketing: we did it w it was.,0
"User Interface: But It is r it is rather easy to use, because you have the primary buttons always visible.",1
Marketing: You have to push harder.,0
Marketing: It is not the most easy to use.,1
Project Manager: Yay I introduce to the world the amazing ant.,1
"Marketing: I have been thinking about this fruit, vegetable thing, I prefer fruits to vegetables,",0
Industrial Designer: And that will that would l would last for well I do I d I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I have never seen one run out.,0
"Marketing: And eighty percent of users, if we think about this there are a lot of television, DVD, stereo remote control users out there, eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy.",1
"User Interface: So, now I'd like to ask for your preferences.",1
Industrial Designer: Then you hold it in your hand like this.,1
User Interface: Shall I just turn it round for time?,0
"Project Manager: So I guess the case would be plastic, with Perhaps that is not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it.",1
Marketing: If you just make a control for just the TV there is just not much to gain here.,0
User Interface: That is people they actually do it themselves.,0
"Project Manager: I see, the onoff is in the back.",0
"Marketing: RSI is like, when you are using the same doing the same movement several times, then you get injured.",1
Industrial Designer: Like a very big scrollwheel.,1
Project Manager: And what is the acceptable criteria? Is there like a scale that we have to hit?,0
Marketing: What do you think? Two?,1
"Industrial Designer: It is not perfect, but.",0
Project Manager: at the end we will we will evaluate ourself as a team.,0
"Marketing: What they found is that people do not like how current remote controls are, so you know, definitely you should be looking at something quite different.",1
Project Manager: Yeah but this the is for the.,0
User Interface: I'm just saying that the currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f customisable for different people.,1
"Industrial Designer: Not so much an atmosphere, the atmosphere is very relaxed, but the gear.",0
Industrial Designer: It is gonna be very important to the company.,0
Project Manager: so I suppose the first to do the presentation will be the User Interface Designer.,1
User Interface: It is also green or.,0
"Project Manager: Yes, well i it should have the expected functionality of a remote control.",0
"User Interface: Well like since it just has the circle thing, you could make it a qui a kind of cool shape, like it could be a cool sort of you know, because it could be circular, you know, or something weird like that, just.",1
"Project Manager: We have a power button, setting buttons, LCD window, the number buttons.",1
Industrial Designer: It could be an ape.,0
"Project Manager: If you look closely, you can see.",0
"Project Manager: it is Yeah, but my opinion I think it is better under the flip because whenever you want to the talk, so then you can speak then you can close it.",1
"Marketing: We have talked about pointers, but the very use of a remote control, if you are someone who is zapping, who is sitting like that, we found so many people did, how do you minimise that on such a small device?",1
"Project Manager: Do we, do we make a light under the under the n under the numbers, everything? Do.",0
Project Manager: I'm really excited to start this team.,0
User Interface: We chose a different type of colour for the menu.,1
Project Manager: So both of those concepts.,1
"User Interface: They are right on your screen,",0
Project Manager: Yeah what I'm gonna I'm gonna put.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, it is a good option.",0
"Project Manager: So as you can see here, for example, the battery really not very little choice in that one.",1
Project Manager: I rounded it up far too fast.,0
Industrial Designer: A button for the subtitles.,1
Project Manager: Well we have to choose one of them.,1
"User Interface: And I thinked of the button sizes, I'm not sure if they have to be big or just small.",0
"Project Manager: I think basically you will get instructions to work with, if you have any questions, I guess, you can.",0
"Project Manager: Not so much that we were not full of ideas, but of ones that are gonna allow us to actually build the thing.",1
"Project Manager: so I understand when we want a display we need a expensive chip, but when we want a scrolling wheel w we also need the expensive chip, so can we use same chip, so with one expensive chip we can implement several complicated or advanced features.",1
"Industrial Designer: And I think our budget is too low to use, an LCD, the chip who is more expensive.",1
"User Interface: For example, if you are watching a French program, you would like to have a subtitles in English, then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see the the subtitles on the screen.",0
"Project Manager: So, we will have the three presentations from the In Industrial Designer, User Interface Designer,",1
Project Manager: this is a problem.,1
User Interface: I think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project.,1
"Project Manager: So, You must p push a little Good.",0
"Project Manager: You you D does not it work? Maybe someo Maybe maybe Anna, maybe you can start.",1
"Marketing: Yeah, we can b It c it could be just a square, just a packet.",0
"User Interface: So if that is your thing, you got something like that instead,",0
"Industrial Designer: I think it is also important to make it possible to how do you call it in English, to not use batteries, use ac bat batteries to to be.",1
Project Manager: I would say four.,1
Project Manager: A mouse is not too difficult.,0
User Interface: If the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough.,1
User Interface: Without affecting the circuit board.,1
"Industrial Designer: there is not a lot to wrong, the components are cheap to make.",0
Marketing: Is that so? Was it it was not just a prototype?,0
"Project Manager: Whereas it would be the special colour would be for the So you would only have the one special button that was rubber, whereas the rest would be hard plastic.",1
"Project Manager: That, Steph, is your part, is the userfriendliness.",1
Project Manager: it is not because I do not like you but.,0
"Industrial Designer: N wha what I have what I have seen, just not related to this, but of latex cases before, is that there is like a hard plastic inside, it is just covered with the latex.",1
"Industrial Designer: Now, well this is the idea about the bumps.",0
"Marketing: I'd rather just go to the board, get us to spend eighteen dollars a remote.",0
"Marketing: It is a bit sketchy at some times, you are not gonna get good always accurate results, but for a very fixed number of words, you know you have, how many different words can you have for a remote control, up, down, left, right, channel five, channel seven, you know, how many, you ca not have that many words.",1
"User Interface: so you must point everywhere, so maybe infrared is.",1
"User Interface: Maybe the buttons could like decrease in s the bigger ones you know they could actually be bigger in size than the ones that are less important, the smaller here.",1
"Project Manager: Unless this unless this part were raised, so say the cover flips over, covers that part.",0
"User Interface: I believe the But you have already you must have a red on, off button.",0
Project Manager: so do you want to.,0
Project Manager: So what are we going to to do? What are we going to make f kind of functions in the remote? And why are we going to do it? Then the conceptual design.,1
Industrial Designer: Well y you have this chip.,0
"Project Manager: I I'm not really sure how this works, but.",1
"Marketing: Drawing on the fashion trends at the moment, fruit, vegetables.",1
"Marketing: Yeah, the basics then by a volume, channel, one till two zero numbers on it,",1
"Marketing: For example, you can see below there, seventy five percent of users zap a lot,",1
Project Manager: This is our conceptual design meeting.,1
Project Manager: It is a pig.,0
Project Manager: If money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that.,1
Project Manager: Because the LCD has more support on customer side.,1
Marketing: So in part I could I could give you some of my personal preferences but I could also th add some to this which is just about sort of sort of market research.,0
Industrial Designer: A little bit.,1
"User Interface: Or from my perspective I think LCD is a mistake because this is a universal remote, all you are doing I mean it is you are not gonna get any information back from the television, so the only information you can display on this remote is what channel you just sent it at last, there is just not a lot of information, you know, there.",1
Project Manager: we have a financial aspect to this project.,1
"Marketing: well there has been inv investigation again, in the in the remote control market.",0
User Interface: and these two are to scroll the programme channels.,0
"User Interface: I mean people forget to put their cordless phones back on there,",1
"Project Manager: something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite obviously into the design,",0
"User Interface: So we just have it like add a menu button then for the various things needed,",1
"Industrial Designer: you have you had those balls, you know those stress balls where you bounce the ball, it, it lights up, it goes,",0
"Industrial Designer: And then the next slide just shows how the copper wires interact with the buttons, the rubber buttons, to get sent to the chip.",1
Marketing: but maybe we could incorporate that into the voice.,1
"Marketing: So sh completely changed our demographic there,",1
User Interface: I heard a beep go.,0
"Industrial Designer: It just explains how the process goes through, from a.",1
"Project Manager: I think this was very good,",0
Project Manager: I would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off.,1
"Project Manager: I guess we are supposed to discuss the prod the process of the project, how satisfied, it is alright.",0
"User Interface: If you make one big touch screen,",1
User Interface: Just something maybe if you ha if it had like if some kind of like light or something or lights around it.,1
Project Manager: But it might be something you could consider when you are thinking about shapes?,0
