Source,Summary
Project Manager: And product evaluation.,1
"Marketing: Try it, yeah maybe.",0
"Project Manager: I mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it, so, you know.",1
"User Interface: And basically it depends like the remote with LCD display for browsing because you have multiple functionalities for example you are watching a movie, you are having a universal remote control, you want to you do not know really which functionality is now, so I am using the TV so every time I use it, it could be like, for example I can use a simple toggle switch, a display, so I press it so the display says, I'm in TV or DVD or whatever it is, instead of having three keys separately for four keys,",1
Project Manager: Maybe you can look how much it is for the LCD.,0
"Industrial Designer: I think controlling is not the right word, I think the interactions are very structured.",1
Project Manager: They cost us all the same.,0
"Industrial Designer: May fail though, every here, there.",1
"Project Manager: So big buttons, flashy design, maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing.",1
Project Manager: It does not tell me.,0
"Industrial Designer: I do not think there is a sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a, like a consensus right, we go around, we think about it,",1
Industrial Designer: is that a function we want in the remote?,0
Marketing: Same sort of function? The criteria? It is alright.,0
Project Manager: let me see.,0
Industrial Designer: Something what also younger people want.,1
User Interface: do not use my opinion.,0
Industrial Designer: to something which is maybe more universal.,1
Project Manager: Right well this is the kickoff meeting for our project.,0
Marketing: Let is go on then.,0
User Interface: Like you said before.,0
"Marketing: we can make it brown, dark brown, not wood.",1
Project Manager: I think it is not too expensive.,0
Marketing: You had different remote controls for different devices.,1
"Marketing: but ninety one percent, fifteen to twenty five.",1
Marketing: So we can launch it.,1
Project Manager: so I will I let David Jordan do his presentation.,0
"Industrial Designer: The second version is also simpler, we d we had just I have to put the microphone also.",1
Industrial Designer: So at least seven to seven.,0
"Marketing: We could make things much more f I think the eighty percent of people would spend more on a remote that looks better, combined with decrease the or take out the limited functio functions that we do not really use much.",0
Project Manager: And would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition?,1
"Marketing: Like I do not know if they would actually go out, purchase this themselves, a fifteen year old you know.",1
Project Manager: but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer.,0
Project Manager: what is a hand dynamo?,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, two years' time this will be on the market.",0
Project Manager: I would say a two.,1
Project Manager: let is call this to an end.,0
"Marketing: One is fancy look, second is innovative, third is easy to use.",1
Industrial Designer: So maybe there is like a set design which we get printed off.,0
"Project Manager: But you do mention the next, previous button.",0
"Marketing: normally you only every use, you know, on a TV remote you only ever use, mostly, you know, f four or f six buttons.",1
"Industrial Designer: Why would you put it then, where is the recording the microphone?",0
"User Interface: No, tha that w that w that would be more promising.",0
"Marketing: So maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use, trendy, fancy, feels good, with a display, wood, designer wood, designer colours.",1
Marketing: ease of use.,1
Project Manager: I'm gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders.,1
"Marketing: Yeah but you know the average frequency of pushing buttons, it is about.",0
"Project Manager: Twelve, a half Euros is what supposed to cost us.",0
User Interface: You have to do it over.,1
Project Manager: But remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the.,0
Industrial Designer: I'm the Industrial Designer.,1
"Project Manager: Right, we are gonna try out the electronic whiteboards.",0
"Marketing: Because we decided to have two kind of remotes, two designs, or was it two colours?",1
"Marketing: Hey, what what is the company colour? Did you get told what the company colour is or.",0
User Interface: like it is just been brought up again then.,0
User Interface: So you so you move to the next the next one.,1
Industrial Designer: Or we can do something like that.,1
Project Manager: Thank you very much.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five,",1
User Interface: We will not use this.,1
Industrial Designer: and discuss it in the next meeting.,0
"User Interface: So you generally see rectangular shape, very monotonous kind of designs here.",1
"Industrial Designer: Because we have tried to make it a little bit innovative,",0
"Marketing: So, I would give this a five.",1
User Interface: what is the purpose of the light?,0
Project Manager: I do not see any power cables here so.,0
Project Manager: Because we have to decide this.,0
"Project Manager: we want it to be original, something that is people have not thought of, that is not out in the shops, trendy, appealing to a wide market, but you know, not a hunk of metal, userfriendly, grannies to kids, maybe even pooches should be able to use it.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, a little bit.",1
Industrial Designer: I'm just thinking totally different designs also.,1
Project Manager: It is the little blue w it is the one th.,0
User Interface: and would cost us to build it about eight Euros.,0
Project Manager: So we need to calculate the production cost.,1
Marketing: Yeah but if you shape it.,0
Marketing: fifty percent I think of all these nbers the most important is fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons.,1
Industrial Designer: Fr I mean the never mind.,0
"Project Manager: but if we all have a think, when we go away from the meeting, what specific things could be included in this remote control that are out of the ordinary.",1
"Marketing: Well I have noticed that gaming c is becoming quite popular with television, when I was younger we used to e play games using our cable, using the cable subscribed the cable providers,",1
"Industrial Designer: I thought but this is really your department, that we need just the functional display, four cursors.",1
"Industrial Designer: This is incremental, but once you press it for a long time, you go five by five.",1
"Project Manager: I have got I think we should also have a backup plan of I 'cause I just think that it might be expensive to make something that I mean we do not, we have not been told it has to be something that will control everything.",0
Project Manager: that pen drawings.,0
"Project Manager: It is actually a novel thing because you could sell it a as a novelty, just to be actually serious for a minute here,",0
Project Manager: I think it was better to have this price list a bit earlier.,1
Marketing: It is your it is your job.,0
Project Manager: Yeah such as maybe the.,0
Marketing: Yeah e power supply is one of the most important things.,1
Project Manager: Or we can put these in the project folder as well.,0
"Marketing: No, it you did better.",1
"Marketing: And then it kinda there was a green, I think it was a green ring, there was like red going out like this.",0
Marketing: criteria four is costs.,1
"Project Manager: Yeah, the project is evaluated.",0
User Interface: but these are these are all necessary functions.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yes, but when you put that same volt voltages on it, you can put when the when the when o the lowest part of it, when it is o the same as the other products, you can put it all on the same.",1
"User Interface: the distance from your television to your remote control has to be, yeah yeah, quite a big distance.",1
"Marketing: they have like a touch screen with really big pictures on it like call hangup, that is a big ad advantage I think, because one the one hand you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by scaling up the pictures or something.",1
"Marketing: I guess the other option, referring to the battery thing is, you know how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds or something, when you are s, then it goes,",1
"User Interface: about yeah like yeah, a bit like radio presets.",0
"User Interface: You need to change channels, both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing.",1
Marketing: you only have channel button or volume button.,1
User Interface: Programming them can be a right pain.,1
"User Interface: in writing letters, of course, yeah? Yeah, normally, this the w Block letter sign it, yeah?",0
"User Interface: I mean there are there are advantages, disadvantages if you if you have an LCD display, it is nice, because it is it lets you just sort of sit there, st, control your television from your armchair.",0
Marketing: building games like Snake or Tetris to amuse the younger users.,1
User Interface: It is just a bird.,0
"Project Manager: The sample sensor, for speak recognition anyway.",0
"User Interface: 'Cause we have brought it down to basically four controls most common, which are channel, volume.",0
"Industrial Designer: So or maybe set it out in the sun, it, you know, gets, from the light, a solar cell inside there.",1
Project Manager: I will delete this one now because we do not use it yet.,0
"Industrial Designer: But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control, because it will just lie there for a long while sometimes.",1
Marketing: we did it w it was.,0
"User Interface: But It is r it is rather easy to use, because you have the primary buttons always visible.",1
Marketing: You have to push harder.,0
Marketing: It is not the most easy to use.,1
Project Manager: Yay I introduce to the world the amazing ant.,1
"Marketing: I have been thinking about this fruit, vegetable thing, I prefer fruits to vegetables,",0
Industrial Designer: And that will that would l would last for well I do I d I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I have never seen one run out.,0
"Marketing: And eighty percent of users, if we think about this there are a lot of television, DVD, stereo remote control users out there, eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy.",1
"User Interface: So, now I'd like to ask for your preferences.",1
Industrial Designer: Then you hold it in your hand like this.,1
User Interface: Shall I just turn it round for time?,0
"Project Manager: So I guess the case would be plastic, with Perhaps that is not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it.",1
Marketing: If you just make a control for just the TV there is just not much to gain here.,0
User Interface: That is people they actually do it themselves.,0
"Project Manager: I see, the onoff is in the back.",0
"Marketing: RSI is like, when you are using the same doing the same movement several times, then you get injured.",1
Industrial Designer: Like a very big scrollwheel.,1
Project Manager: And what is the acceptable criteria? Is there like a scale that we have to hit?,0
Marketing: What do you think? Two?,1
"Industrial Designer: It is not perfect, but.",0
Project Manager: at the end we will we will evaluate ourself as a team.,0
"Marketing: What they found is that people do not like how current remote controls are, so you know, definitely you should be looking at something quite different.",1
Project Manager: Yeah but this the is for the.,0
User Interface: I'm just saying that the currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f customisable for different people.,1
"Industrial Designer: Not so much an atmosphere, the atmosphere is very relaxed, but the gear.",0
Industrial Designer: It is gonna be very important to the company.,0
Project Manager: so I suppose the first to do the presentation will be the User Interface Designer.,1
User Interface: It is also green or.,0
"Project Manager: Yes, well i it should have the expected functionality of a remote control.",0
"User Interface: Well like since it just has the circle thing, you could make it a qui a kind of cool shape, like it could be a cool sort of you know, because it could be circular, you know, or something weird like that, just.",1
"Project Manager: We have a power button, setting buttons, LCD window, the number buttons.",1
Industrial Designer: It could be an ape.,0
"Project Manager: If you look closely, you can see.",0
"Project Manager: it is Yeah, but my opinion I think it is better under the flip because whenever you want to the talk, so then you can speak then you can close it.",1
"Marketing: We have talked about pointers, but the very use of a remote control, if you are someone who is zapping, who is sitting like that, we found so many people did, how do you minimise that on such a small device?",1
"Project Manager: Do we, do we make a light under the under the n under the numbers, everything? Do.",0
Project Manager: I'm really excited to start this team.,0
User Interface: We chose a different type of colour for the menu.,1
Project Manager: So both of those concepts.,1
"User Interface: They are right on your screen,",0
Project Manager: Yeah what I'm gonna I'm gonna put.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, it is a good option.",0
"Project Manager: So as you can see here, for example, the battery really not very little choice in that one.",1
Project Manager: I rounded it up far too fast.,0
Industrial Designer: A button for the subtitles.,1
Project Manager: Well we have to choose one of them.,1
"User Interface: And I thinked of the button sizes, I'm not sure if they have to be big or just small.",0
"Project Manager: I think basically you will get instructions to work with, if you have any questions, I guess, you can.",0
"Project Manager: Not so much that we were not full of ideas, but of ones that are gonna allow us to actually build the thing.",1
"Project Manager: so I understand when we want a display we need a expensive chip, but when we want a scrolling wheel w we also need the expensive chip, so can we use same chip, so with one expensive chip we can implement several complicated or advanced features.",1
"Industrial Designer: And I think our budget is too low to use, an LCD, the chip who is more expensive.",1
"User Interface: For example, if you are watching a French program, you would like to have a subtitles in English, then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see the the subtitles on the screen.",0
"Project Manager: So, we will have the three presentations from the In Industrial Designer, User Interface Designer,",1
Project Manager: this is a problem.,1
User Interface: I think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project.,1
"Project Manager: So, You must p push a little Good.",0
"Project Manager: You you D does not it work? Maybe someo Maybe maybe Anna, maybe you can start.",1
"Marketing: Yeah, we can b It c it could be just a square, just a packet.",0
"User Interface: So if that is your thing, you got something like that instead,",0
"Industrial Designer: I think it is also important to make it possible to how do you call it in English, to not use batteries, use ac bat batteries to to be.",1
Project Manager: I would say four.,1
Project Manager: A mouse is not too difficult.,0
User Interface: If the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough.,1
User Interface: Without affecting the circuit board.,1
"Industrial Designer: there is not a lot to wrong, the components are cheap to make.",0
Marketing: Is that so? Was it it was not just a prototype?,0
"Project Manager: Whereas it would be the special colour would be for the So you would only have the one special button that was rubber, whereas the rest would be hard plastic.",1
"Project Manager: That, Steph, is your part, is the userfriendliness.",1
Project Manager: it is not because I do not like you but.,0
"Industrial Designer: N wha what I have what I have seen, just not related to this, but of latex cases before, is that there is like a hard plastic inside, it is just covered with the latex.",1
"Industrial Designer: Now, well this is the idea about the bumps.",0
"Marketing: I'd rather just go to the board, get us to spend eighteen dollars a remote.",0
"Marketing: It is a bit sketchy at some times, you are not gonna get good always accurate results, but for a very fixed number of words, you know you have, how many different words can you have for a remote control, up, down, left, right, channel five, channel seven, you know, how many, you ca not have that many words.",1
"User Interface: so you must point everywhere, so maybe infrared is.",1
"User Interface: Maybe the buttons could like decrease in s the bigger ones you know they could actually be bigger in size than the ones that are less important, the smaller here.",1
"Project Manager: Unless this unless this part were raised, so say the cover flips over, covers that part.",0
"User Interface: I believe the But you have already you must have a red on, off button.",0
Project Manager: so do you want to.,0
Project Manager: So what are we going to to do? What are we going to make f kind of functions in the remote? And why are we going to do it? Then the conceptual design.,1
Industrial Designer: Well y you have this chip.,0
"Project Manager: I I'm not really sure how this works, but.",1
"Marketing: Drawing on the fashion trends at the moment, fruit, vegetables.",1
"Marketing: Yeah, the basics then by a volume, channel, one till two zero numbers on it,",1
"Marketing: For example, you can see below there, seventy five percent of users zap a lot,",1
Project Manager: This is our conceptual design meeting.,1
Project Manager: It is a pig.,0
Project Manager: If money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that.,1
Project Manager: Because the LCD has more support on customer side.,1
Marketing: So in part I could I could give you some of my personal preferences but I could also th add some to this which is just about sort of sort of market research.,0
Industrial Designer: A little bit.,1
"User Interface: Or from my perspective I think LCD is a mistake because this is a universal remote, all you are doing I mean it is you are not gonna get any information back from the television, so the only information you can display on this remote is what channel you just sent it at last, there is just not a lot of information, you know, there.",1
Project Manager: we have a financial aspect to this project.,1
"Marketing: well there has been inv investigation again, in the in the remote control market.",0
User Interface: and these two are to scroll the programme channels.,0
"User Interface: I mean people forget to put their cordless phones back on there,",1
"Project Manager: something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite obviously into the design,",0
"User Interface: So we just have it like add a menu button then for the various things needed,",1
"Industrial Designer: you have you had those balls, you know those stress balls where you bounce the ball, it, it lights up, it goes,",0
"Industrial Designer: And then the next slide just shows how the copper wires interact with the buttons, the rubber buttons, to get sent to the chip.",1
Marketing: but maybe we could incorporate that into the voice.,1
"Marketing: So sh completely changed our demographic there,",1
User Interface: I heard a beep go.,0
"Industrial Designer: It just explains how the process goes through, from a.",1
"Project Manager: I think this was very good,",0
Project Manager: I would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off.,1
"Project Manager: I guess we are supposed to discuss the prod the process of the project, how satisfied, it is alright.",0
"User Interface: If you make one big touch screen,",1
User Interface: Just something maybe if you ha if it had like if some kind of like light or something or lights around it.,1
Project Manager: But it might be something you could consider when you are thinking about shapes?,0
"Industrial Designer: I think the tools that they were given, the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they do not support collaboration, I think that is the word.",1
"Marketing: But So what do you think for it, usefulness?",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, just stuff that you wanna share, just put it in the in the project folder, like I put my presentation now.",1
"User Interface: But the iPod, etcetera, MP three players, mobile phones.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, m maybe we cho should put that on top, buttons we do not use on, in the bottom.",1
User Interface: So it would be cheaper to make.,1
Industrial Designer: So we have this.,0
Project Manager: They want the ergonomic ones.,1
Project Manager: You probably get a mail.,1
Marketing: The voice recognition thing is cool.,1
"Marketing: No you'd hold it you do not if you flip it open then you'd be Would not you? Is not that the idea? You us if we just use the shell as an example again, you open that, you have got your LCD display there, you have got the buttons there so you are holding it in the palm of your hand, yeah.",0
Project Manager: Craig do you wanna.,0
"User Interface: Something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form, which it would need to be to sort of conform to the shape of the hand more efficiently anyway.",1
"Industrial Designer: How about we do a a popup screen, like the laptop.",1
Industrial Designer: It seems like it should be more around two.,0
Marketing: which affected over a quarter of users.,0
"Project Manager: maybe what you can do is, both of you, you can come up with the prototype, the model.",1
"User Interface: So once we decide exactly what we want, then we can figure out the exact positioning, but more or less I think it should go along those lines.",0
Project Manager: Marketing they want product evaluation.,1
"User Interface: From the technical aspect, the processing should be done on the TV set than on the on the remote controller, right?",1
Marketing: Young means sixteen to forty years.,0
"Project Manager: we could do a slide or a compartment, you know, like if it say it is a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing, it'd be easy to have a compartment in there.",1
"Project Manager: Well literally if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than those on a a mobile phone,",0
"Project Manager: UID well yeah you right g your assignments are up there, you will also get s assignments from in your email as well more spec specifics on what do.",0
Project Manager: Should we actually bite the bullet here?,0
Marketing: If I if I need so.,0
"User Interface: what there is one more decisi one more solution in fact, 'cause there are some paints that can change colour according to where they are, like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around, like what colour is around, depending on the temperature,",1
"User Interface: Yeah it is well you can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys, you know right now if you take it you have like zero, one, two, three like a keys separately,",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah but the nonremovable elements of the of the remote, so not the front, could be titanium,",1
"User Interface: I'm Stephanie, I am the User Interface Designer.",1
Marketing: Hi I'm Guillermo.,1
"Project Manager: I do not know, but I think the single curved is good for design, also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control.",1
"Industrial Designer: So it kind of holds nicely, something like that.",0
"Project Manager: what about the case? I think they are talking there about do we want wood, plastic, titanium or rubber,",1
Industrial Designer: The drawing cap capabilities are very limited.,1
"User Interface: I think that was the main aim, one of the main aims that we had.",0
"User Interface: Yeah I think we it was a requirement that we use our th the colours of our company, so would it be like yellow, grey, black or something, or.",1
Project Manager: let is see.,0
Marketing: That is it.,0
"Industrial Designer: Maybe titani, maybe some wood.",1
"User Interface: Yeah, you think?",0
"User Interface: Yeah, the volume ones should stand out a bit.",1
"Project Manager: he here it is still doublecurve, the rubber, the flashy, the fruity, the removable.",1
Project Manager: So we just put something.,0
"Project Manager: Because if you hold it like this, the sensors will get blocked, then the drawing wo not get good.",1
Marketing: I also have copied a different type of remote.,0
Industrial Designer: So these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people? Or it is.,0
User Interface: Well y we have curves in all directions.,1
Marketing: so I Are we going to write off the LCD option?,0
"Industrial Designer: yeah, they are all they are not connected to anything on the table, you just leave 'em on, walk around with 'em.",0
"Industrial Designer: whether they would figure the the s sample senor, the sample speaker, voice recognition be sort of a worthwhile thing to have.",0
Industrial Designer: I think it is pretty much the same sort of connection.,0
"Marketing: So elephants are big, strong, gentle, they have great memories, they begin with the letter E, just like Ebenezer.",0
"Industrial Designer: It might even be one, a bit more complex LCD panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the, you know, the symbols of the various functions.",1
Project Manager: Because it was important for young customers if you remember.,0
Project Manager: I'm sure your personal coach will give you more information on that.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah no, for su for sure because I'm will now type them out.",1
Project Manager: I will just review what we did in our last meeting.,1
"User Interface: I would propose this concept for design, just few buttons, a screen with a back light which can change colours, titanium.",1
"User Interface: And this one, the oversized one, I do not know about you, but I think it is a bit too gimmicky.",1
Project Manager: I mean th certainly.,0
Project Manager: It is not yet a standard development those so.,0
"Industrial Designer: So w single curved? let is say would be a b square box, but then with curves on one dimension.",1
Industrial Designer: then you have to shake it all when it is when it is empty.,0
"Project Manager: So maybe we think we can think more about that, discuss that maybe last time next time.",0
User Interface: that would only add buttons.,0
User Interface: A remote control without the ten digits.,1
Project Manager: this is a bit pity for the Marketing Expert.,0
Project Manager: We will open that when the time is right.,0
"Project Manager: So, turning channel, of course.",0
User Interface: So but I think that is something we need to work on next time is really finding out more about the target market.,0
"Industrial Designer: We have, we have done well.",0
Marketing: Yeah so but th that is kind of standard T television so it also works on that.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, what about price, is that gonna go on there as well? Price of materials.",1
"Industrial Designer: I believe it is ins it is gotta be inside the TV, not inside the remote.",1
"Industrial Designer: Something which is not squarey maybe, not a box.",1
"Project Manager: And then w yeah, then we could have it, but it is its' well it is r it is the main point of the look.",0
Project Manager: Yeah but I do not I think it They are two different things though.,1
"Marketing: But maybe the buttons, all buttons in red is maybe a bad contrast for colourblind people.",1
Marketing: Twenty five Euro for a remote control.,1
"Project Manager: Especially the big ones, the big brands,",1
Marketing: Yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells.,1
Marketing: What else can we need?,0
"User Interface: We already have the beeping of the home station,",0
"Marketing: But if you can imagine that they say A, B, C, D, then that would be really good.",1
Project Manager: We we are definitely going to have to.,0
Project Manager: And we can all work on our own projects.,0
Industrial Designer: Yeah we have to kind of work together.,1
"Project Manager: for the moment not yet, but what is your do you have some project plan, something with you or.",1
"Project Manager: I mean not necessarily that the the whole body has to be of the company colour, so you know blue, yellow tend to go to we well together.",1
"Project Manager: the iPod, we really liked the look of that.",1
Marketing: Do you have any data on how much different prints cost? I mean can you get the entire thing printed with a design?,0
"Industrial Designer: So people are used to that kind of shape,",1
Project Manager: And the screen is disfmarer.,0
"Project Manager: So we are really probably, in terms of marketing, are looking for that is that is a cost winner rather than a fantastic new feature product.",1
Marketing: The remote control is easy to be found.,1
"User Interface: But we already have the scrollwheels, the sp the speaker the speak recognition, the rubber, the fancy colours.",1
"Marketing: So we have the choice between rubber, plastic.",0
"Marketing: So we are showing our preference for particular fruits,",1
Project Manager: The people have to keep buying.,0
Marketing: He is crying because it is ugl because of his ugliness.,0
"Project Manager: So, I will invite Christine to discuss about the functional design.",0
"Marketing: So even if they are only watching four or five channels, I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels,",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, that is good.",0
Project Manager: from twelve fifty if we d wanna get our fift hundred per cent profit margin that would mean selling it from twenty five.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, we could make an a separate menu on the LCD screen for teletext.",1
"Marketing: So, I mean, if you are watching a movie, suddenly there is a dark some dark scene, the lights adapt themself.",1
Marketing: No you are not connected to me anymore.,0
"Project Manager: and new ideas found, again gi no given relatively everyday product, I think we have v very very effectively come up with a new.",1
"Marketing: If this is our docking station, we can make our logo over here.",1
"Industrial Designer: The display requires a advanced chip, which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip.",1
"Marketing: I think this is going back to the graph at the beginning that I made, where, you know, the buttons that people use all the time, you want buttons for them, everything else menudriven.",1
Industrial Designer: so I guess the rest of it.,0
Industrial Designer: No just kidding.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind, we could make tons of money, I think.",1
User Interface: That is what people want to do.,0
Project Manager: it is below the budget.,0
Industrial Designer: But we lose the locator.,1
"Marketing: but I think we do not have a specific audience, you know, like what is our target audience, what niche are niche are we trying to market, corner.",1
"Marketing: But I think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting, especially if we are going after a younger market,",1
"Industrial Designer: Findings which were the required materials for the basic internal construction, so all the really simplistic functions that we just discussed, we need rubber for buttons, alini for battery y contacts, integrated circuit which consists of a diode, transistor, resonator, resistors, a capacitator, all those basic things that make a circuit function.",1
"User Interface: So you can you can design an interface which is very simple, which is userfriendly.",1
"User Interface: We do not have to follow every trend, I guess.",0
"Marketing: Well I had the cat as well, but I have got a spare one.",0
"Marketing: right? Always, so I dunno what w what we have to decide about that.",1
Industrial Designer: well you can go from doublecurved to singlecurved.,0
Project Manager: is there anything anybody is unsure about?,0
"Industrial Designer: They also like straightforward shapes, luxurious style.",0
Marketing: The user will just be able to say please can you pump up the vo pump up the volume.,0
User Interface: It should not be completely like a cube.,0
"Project Manager: It should be on your desktop, so on the.",0
"User Interface: So then basically it has to have some way to get to get to a mode on the television where you are doing,",0
Industrial Designer: Normal rubber I think.,1
"Project Manager: I do not suppose we have got any statistics on the life expectancy of remote controls, particularly sort of independent ones.",1
Industrial Designer: It is just a s shape so it does not matter.,0
Marketing: I closed it.,0
"User Interface: I have done a presentation, but it pretty much covers work that we have both done, so if I'm missing anything, Christine can just correct me.",1
Project Manager: so maybe we can stay with wood.,1
Project Manager: maybe I think maybe the kinetic thing is something.,1
"Industrial Designer: But may maybe we could go more directly, I do not know.",0
"Marketing: If it is made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there,",0
Industrial Designer: But the main point we talk about that with our manufacturer.,0
"Marketing: Yeah, but did we reach, with our style, the targeted audience?",1
"Industrial Designer: for the case, the supplement, the buttons, it really depends on the designer.",1
Industrial Designer: I must not forget my pen the next time.,0
Industrial Designer: It is just printing something on a board.,0
Project Manager: If you cover it with rubber.,0
"User Interface: So, there must be some cheap standard cover, maybe white or something,",1
"User Interface: One nice wee feature if we could if we could still do the rubber, I though of was to have the rubber extend beyond the end of the of the rigid substructure.",1
Project Manager: I think it is.,1
Project Manager: Think they are just called face plates?,0
Project Manager: Can you maybe fix the other.,0
"User Interface: So you do not use it that much, you do not have to see it all the time.",0
User Interface: Ah the logo should be on the top I think.,1
Project Manager: If I draw here It draws about four centimetres lower than.,0
Marketing: We have w definitely talking some type of.,0
Industrial Designer: components of a remote control.,1
Marketing: And I was sent a report that was I think there were a hundred remote users that they interviewed.,1
Industrial Designer: certain restrictions do apply here though.,0
Project Manager: but I do not know how useful it'd be for changing the channel.,0
"User Interface: So, it just depends what you think about these ideas, if I'm yeah, maybe, Kate, you better say what you think about them.",1
Project Manager: But that can be done later.,0
User Interface: Something like this.,0
"Project Manager: Now I have this the company is costing for various aspects of design, I have treated some of these slightly liberally given the constraints placed on us, I would not know for in for instance if they require us to have it in the corporate colours, then that is not a special colour, that is a that is a standard colour.",1
Project Manager: But it would be nice.,0
User Interface: And the rest is hard plastic.,1
User Interface: There are some spiders that live in like that have like kind of a big ball of a of a web.,0
"Industrial Designer: So then there is this other matter of the chips, well we could use a simple design on the board,",0
Project Manager: But that covers all the all the other settings.,0
User Interface: I dunno if we can use that.,1
"Project Manager: So I'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers, we speak about this tool we are going to design, try to make a project plan, some discussion, then we talk of the next meeting.",0
User Interface: But maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them be kind of down so you could feel them.,0
"Project Manager: Because if we do have enough space in our finance, I would say do integrate it,",1
User Interface: But there is already in a one done.,0
User Interface: Some kind of thing or it gives a b bleep sound or some kind of sound.,0
Industrial Designer: Yeah so it is a.,0
Industrial Designer: No no we will This is a preference but we can always change.,0
"Industrial Designer: It is not changing, no?",0
"User Interface: If you want to turn the ball, it is very it is very convenient for you to turn the ball to change the channel.",1
"Industrial Designer: Well, f four five buttons, it is sufficient.",1
"Project Manager: My favourite animal, which changes all the time,",1
User Interface: Well it is it is more I mean it is more ecofriendly than the than the cradle 'cause you are still using power off the grid with the cradle.,0
Project Manager: As to a the costs involved.,0
"Industrial Designer: We can think about TV with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones, you know.",1
"Industrial Designer: then we have it on the TV, the menu.",1
Industrial Designer: That is why we have that button.,0
"Project Manager: Yes, 'cause our market is international, your problem is has to do with marketing of you know, you gotta know how many we are going to be selling to know how big a market you have to target, who is that.",0
User Interface: A very good example is Google.,1
User Interface: it is just one colo yeah.,0
"Marketing: Questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven, from true to false,",1
"Marketing: No, I think we come up with a with a attractive marketable product, concept.",0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah we will yeah, so I will be able to summarize our meeting,",0
"Marketing: Yeah, I mean you are famous.",0
"Marketing: Most people'd be willing to pay for that most people want remote controls to be pretty, they want it to be fancy, th they want it to be different, everybody has a white remote control with black buttons, a red button, a green button, not everybody wants that.",1
"Industrial Designer: we can use rubber, plastic, wood or titani.",1
Industrial Designer: This can be discussed as well.,0
"Project Manager: When you push the button, the remote control gives a signal.",1
"Marketing: there is a there is an important thing that, you know, people use when, you know, when you are filling up your home, you know, a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap, basically, you know, you have got all this stuff, you are just like, what the hell is that, who is ever gonna use it? You know, so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both, so I think we need to aim for both.",1
"Marketing: There we are, that is me.",0
Marketing: Yeah this is the initial specifications.,0
User Interface: If it is enough line.,0
"Project Manager: I think all the special colour things have to be marked over here, because that is what we were planning to do, making it.",1
"User Interface: among the findings I found that m most of the curr presently available remote controls also include other functionalities in their design, like operating a VCR, but they do not seem to be able to deal with DVD players, but then there are surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them, but according to the last minute update actually we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design.",1
"User Interface: we have our we have the enter button, what was the other button here? This is the teletext.",1
Marketing: But we do not have any buttons.,0
Project Manager: and the white board worked really well without any pro.,0
Project Manager: I would say I mean it should be probably designed for a righthanded p person.,1
Industrial Designer: I see some action over there.,0
"Marketing: Maybe it is an idea to sell it without a cover, so that you can pick a cover in the in the shop.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, I s I suppose in a sense you could have if you have got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting rather than having to go one to a hundred, you could go one to one to ten, ten to twenty.",1
Project Manager: and it is kinda new.,0
"Project Manager: right, welcome to meeting B.",1
User Interface: I'd give it a three for this for that.,1
User Interface: You are the only one.,0
"User Interface: simple, plain, but I mean I do see what it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality,",1
"User Interface: And then, well this is on off button.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, but we decided to have something yellow, red, for the costs.",0
"Project Manager: And so if there is one element that requires the more expensive one, or say the regular one, or the more advanced, then that would have to be the same for all of them.",0
Marketing: but I think it is an interesting I think that maybe shows more about being open to technology.,0
"Marketing: So we have one button,",1
"Project Manager: we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about, it needs to be original, trendy, userfriendly.",1
"Marketing: So, now we have to come up with a decision.",1
Marketing: And we are a fashion forward technology company.,0
"Industrial Designer: well my personal preferences here, well we have to keep it simple.",1
Project Manager: I hope our Industrial Designer does this better because this is.,0
Marketing: we want something that people want in their home.,0
Industrial Designer: So hopefully that makes sense for everyone in my kind of garbled way.,0
"Marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface, I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog.",1
"User Interface: But you ca not you ca not use Bluetooth all the time, twenty four hours a day.",1
"Marketing: Was that does that mean to it, single curve?",0
Project Manager: See what was on the agenda.,0
"Marketing: Strangely enough it is more important to be fancy than to be wi, now that is the second thing it has to be, it has to be technologically i innovative,",1
"Project Manager: We were talking about it being more, a lot more tangible.",0
"Project Manager: Y maybe, two? We have two special colours.",1
"Marketing: I think I think the fact that, you know, ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes, I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control, does say quite a lot really.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, production cost is at twelve fifty, so.",0
Industrial Designer: And the company logo.,1
"User Interface: which should not be th that difficult to implement, like eighty to hundred word.",1
User Interface: I give it a four now.,0
"User Interface: And again, using bigger buttons, less number of buttons are also preferred, as I see.",1
"Project Manager: But let is try it, with the different the designs, the functional designs.",1
Marketing: I also have a preference for rubber.,1
User Interface: it is like you press this or this or.,0
Marketing: Then a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that an LCD screen in the remote control would be preferred.,0
"Project Manager: Energy source I think we have, I think we have decided batteries, although not exciting, are probably our best bet.",1
Marketing: I like the fact that on both of them the keys play such a prominent role.,1
Project Manager: Because the expensive parts are in either the advanced chip.,0
"Marketing: Ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more, it goes down from there, seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five, thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five, twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five, then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five.",1
Marketing: I do not know.,0
"User Interface: What about the buttons, would Would the buttons be wood too, or.",1
"Marketing: and then if someone wants to, you know, change the contrast on their TV, they should be able to do that, it should be accessible,",1
"Marketing: Yeah, i if it Yeah, if it costs gets too much, too expensive, then yeah, we should be sticking to rubber buttons.",1
Project Manager: And then we can we can use the time better.,0
Project Manager: So one for the quick zapping possibly one you know with just that rounded part that fits into your hand.,0
"User Interface: I dunno, what is the idea for.",0
Project Manager: I kind of think it is unique enough that I'd give it a one or a two.,1
"Marketing: I'm going to draw a butterfly, because I saw a butterfly yesterday, that seemed to be like the symbol of Spring arriving.",1
Industrial Designer: I also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for.,0
"Project Manager: But the current one, you'd say would be fancy, would be too.",0
"Industrial Designer: yeah, but i basically when I'm watching TV I'm just using like five buttons or so,",1
Project Manager: So I would also say this four.,0
Project Manager: That will it literally would just be a button.,0
"Marketing: One thing I did not say I think, is that a lot of users also said then I would buy a good looking remote control if there will be one.",1
"Project Manager: No the scroll wheel required the regular, so the.",1
Industrial Designer: I imagine that we could specify.,1
"Marketing: At the same time, it is important that it is easy to use.",1
Marketing: And how exactly does the kinetic energy work?,0
Marketing: It is easier to bit nice to handle.,0
"User Interface: What does double curved mean, I do not understand.",1
"Industrial Designer: So keep in mind that everything that you keep think of, it has to b to be built.",0
User Interface: scrollwheel is on the left side.,0
"Project Manager: now, it was function F eight.",1
Marketing: I think I think that will be too big tha too big then.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, plus if anything that is special forms makes it slightly easier to use.",0
"User Interface: Yeah, it was a pleasure working with you.",1
Project Manager: I'm not confident enough.,0
"Project Manager: I mean obviously everyone we are you know sounds like we are all a bit sort of gadget heads, we like things that do everything at once, but you know, that is.",0
Project Manager: And Not sure what they mean by supplements.,1
"Marketing: I had a first part of mine was to make a remote control for a new f remote control for television, afterward I had a discussion about coffee so.",1
"Marketing: Besides that, I think the market for forty plus is like pretty small.",1
Project Manager: And it seems you get more information by email.,1
"Project Manager: we will probably get questionnaire in a minute, it is a.",0
Project Manager: Does not make.,0
"Project Manager: But maybe when you scroll away, back it will be normal,",0
Project Manager: in my interpretation of management is instructions is that yes it meets the requirement.,0
"Project Manager: You are the one that is gotta go, find out do th do the research, see what people want in a remote, what buttons are used more often, s stuff like that.",1
"Industrial Designer: So these are people who are gadgety, right?",1
User Interface: There are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear.,1
"Marketing: F not many buttons, u useable buttons.",1
"Industrial Designer: I was just wondering about the, what, what Genevieve said before, about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing.",1
Industrial Designer: although I ca not see it on my screen.,0
Marketing: What ages are involved.,1
Marketing: That should be pretty nice colour.,0
"User Interface: Banana is yellow, yeah, definitely.",0
Project Manager: So it should be flashy or just more interesting.,1
Marketing: So on the on the top is better.,1
"User Interface: But I do not think when you are watching TV, hearing loud noises from the TV, someone screaming one, you f the channel switches, Yeah.",1
"User Interface: So we need some numbering buttons, some teletext things.",1
"Project Manager: I d I agree, I mean we are simply it is simply required to incorporate the corporate logo prominently.",0
Marketing: So we asked users what frustrates them the most about current remote controls.,0
Project Manager: Yeah it is below forty so we can decide where to.,0
Project Manager: first we have three steps of making the remote control.,0
"User Interface: No, I kne I knew.",0
Project Manager: and w when we to d for this one we have to make it more cheap.,1
Project Manager: and it might be too expensive.,0
"Marketing: Maybe we could think about how, could be more, you know, streamlined.",1
"Industrial Designer: well we have a single curve, which was maybe like the feel of the product is quite good.",1
"Project Manager: Do we take titanium smelling like fruit, or do we make spongy fruitylike.",1
Marketing: And we are all l going to list all the criterion.,0
"Industrial Designer: So well done with the management, I felt well managed.",1
Project Manager: for now this is this is.,0
"Industrial Designer: That is also short, catchy.",0
User Interface: But w like just normal light?,0
"Project Manager: this is the opening, then we will get I will hope we will get acquainted to each other.",1
Industrial Designer: So we cannot work on more than one page at same time.,1
User Interface: here here is just two pictures of remote controls.,0
Project Manager: I think you can turn it this way also.,0
"User Interface: And then we had just two buttons, we place them in the middle, the menu, for the teletext.",1
Marketing: And we put the fashion in electronics.,1
Project Manager: as you can see I mean that is taken up well over half of the price.,1
Project Manager: Problem comes here as you can see in the interface.,1
User Interface: And the kinetic energy part.,1
"User Interface: puts fashion into electronics, we should never forget about it.",0
Marketing: So spongy means y Yeah.,0
"Project Manager: So I might make this a two instead of a one, I guess.",1
Project Manager: so we are putting together a new remote control.,1
"Project Manager: So having this at twenty five Euros is quite attractive, I think.",0
Project Manager: And are they any special form?,0
"Industrial Designer: If we get an advanced chip which is used for the LCD, the display thing, then that is even more expensive.",1
"Industrial Designer: you need a user interface, which controls the chip, thus the messages, the user interface is that is basically just you kn the s sorta design of the actual remote which you hold in your hands, what buttons will be on it.",0
"Project Manager: Could be flat, you could insert your remote into it.",1
Marketing: But I thought it would be curved on two.,0
"Industrial Designer: when it comes to the chiponprint, as I said, the more advanced features you want, the fancier the chip has to be, the more expensive.",1
"Industrial Designer: Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours,",1
User Interface: Sorry can you just say that what is the what are our price goals again?,0
Industrial Designer: So you gotta decide which of those is more important to them.,1
Marketing: it was a report about an experiment with a lot of users.,0
Project Manager: of course we have not actually got a working model yet.,0
"Project Manager: We put the fashion in electronics,",0
Project Manager: here is the agenda for the meeting.,0
"Marketing: And there was something else, they kept track of the frequency per hour in using certain buttons.",1
"Marketing: Uhhuh, that was not very much.",1
Marketing: that is cool.,0
"Project Manager: I think we also have to go to our own rooms again, but well.",1
Industrial Designer: because it is really a team project with a team.,0
Industrial Designer: So I do not think it is that much of a problem.,0
Project Manager: and m maximise the profits.,0
"User Interface: well I think other than ge getting a sort of more aesthetically pleasing form for it, mo most of the sort of layout design decisions are are made, I would say.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah button shape might be a good idea to change, rather than rather than positioning,",0
"Project Manager: Cause I thought it was only men,",0
"Project Manager: Yes, I think just I just write a final report.",1
Industrial Designer: But all these things are usually inhouse so we do not have much problems.,0
User Interface: then I'd like to make a proposal.,1
Project Manager: it is only for televis.,0
"Marketing: you know, where you can use both hands, like a little keyboard type thing.",1
User Interface: Might be quite expensive to do that though.,1
"User Interface: well, there are l at least basic functions, like just th the channels one till nine, on, off switch, which must be clear with a red button or something like that.",1
"Industrial Designer: It can actually be flat or it can be curved, then the different types of materials that you can use, I do not think you can use them in a combination, but.",1
Industrial Designer: And we are having the speakers regular chip for control.,0
"Marketing: The target group has a weak spot for fruit, vegetables, like primary colours, spongy shape.",1
"Industrial Designer: so good news from me for me from Hamed, but bad news from Bob obviously, because spongy design, I do not like it as.",0
"Marketing: And how do you know? I mean, you got that email.",1
Project Manager: Maybe not even pointed.,1
Industrial Designer: So we will get to that later I guess.,0
"Project Manager: We have to look what the needs are, the effects of the functional design, how the the remote control works, so that is where we are going to look in the functional design, it is for the f next meeting.",1
User Interface: now my personal preferences.,1
"Project Manager: Well, every customer, they have their own ideas, they have their own test, so there is no end, there is no limit.",1
Project Manager: My name is Rose Lindgren.,1
User Interface: It is a scary cartoon dog.,0
Marketing: then forget about it.,1
"Project Manager: Electronic simple chip on print, we will need one of those.",1
"Project Manager: It sounds like the covers that they use for the remote, you know, your t your cell phone.",1
Marketing: I do not know if that is the correct word.,0
"Project Manager: 'Cause I mean we have all we all kind of agreed our product is satisfactory, it fits the budget, it is trendy.",1
Marketing: so this is just a presentation on the trends that we are gonna use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment.,0
"User Interface: But they want to talk into the remo remote control, or something,",1
"Industrial Designer: So I prefer kinetic because it is well, the costs are not that much higher, ju just a bit more hightech than a normal battery.",0
"Project Manager: So, do we have a hand dynamo? No.",0
"Marketing: Personally, I do not really think that I want one that is gonna go out of style or go stale, excuse the pun, in a year, so.",1
User Interface: then this this this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product.,1
"Marketing: but like so you'd just say remote five, you know, remote ten, remote one two nine.",1
"Marketing: And then ease of use was the third most important, whi so really, no matter what, we need to focus the most on fancy look, feel, according to this.",1
Project Manager: But that is not for me to decide.,0
Marketing: Then there are some onetime use function.,1
"Industrial Designer: Well, can we talk about something else?",0
"Industrial Designer: Maybe it can be yeah middle of like, between those two.",1
"Industrial Designer: It is not it is not quite a face plate, it is more like a pseudoface plate because it is simple enough.",0
"Industrial Designer: Now for buttons, normal requirements like bit coding, all those things are required.",0
"User Interface: basically the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance, in this case the television set.",1
"Industrial Designer: Have to think about the question, you know, 'cause it is I think that you know you can always you know.",0
"Marketing: I would say it is the Russian trick, but.",1
"Marketing: I was actually kind of upset you know at the budget, that we had to cut a lot of stuff.",1
"User Interface: we are probably gonna have to go with a like a medium chip, s I would imagine.",1
User Interface: You need a onoff switch I do not know how that got in there.,0
Industrial Designer: It should be.,1
Marketing: It is kind of like Eighties neonstyle.,0
Project Manager: You can look at it for s presentation.,0
"Industrial Designer: On the left a scroll button, on the right a scroll button.",0
User Interface: I made my own map.,0
User Interface: I found it as well.,0
"User Interface: So the scroll wheel, in or out?",1
"Project Manager: And like if the if the phone is under the couch, you might not see the light, so.",1
"Marketing: because I mean all the other remote controls on the market have infrared, so people do not expect anything other than infrared.",1
"Industrial Designer: Like with your keychain, if you whistle it goes it makes a sound.",1
"Marketing: And w when you want to use the parents option, you have to.",0
Industrial Designer: Yeah we need one integrated button for everything then.,1
"User Interface: Alright, so from when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting, we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape, the material that we chose was wood, the colour would be customisable, 'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour.",1
"Industrial Designer: So, are there any more cycles in this process? I think not.",0
"Project Manager: so anyway, yeah, this is what we are gonna do afterwards, just lunch break, have more individual work after that, so let is see what we let is see we So you have to come up with a components concept, yeah.",1
"Industrial Designer: it does actually you know affect how, w whether you feel comfortable to communicate.",1
Project Manager: It does not work any more.,0
"Marketing: Ah, but in my instructions I think it said I was supposed to go to the board, do something.",0
Project Manager: First we have to make a functional design.,1
Marketing: So it might be helpful if we had a look at that.,0
"Industrial Designer: because we could produce, you know how cellphones have those overlays that you can change the colour.",1
Project Manager: I think we have to keep the LCD.,1
"Industrial Designer: I would not think so, 'cause we could probably get it from like, in bulk, from a newer company.",0
Marketing: With these new costings.,1
"User Interface: And you have to put in a number, so it works on your TV.",1
"Marketing: which I think given the target group is what you would expect, really.",0
User Interface: and I have just got an email from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in.,0
Project Manager: And as usual you will receive some specific instructions on.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, of course.",0
Marketing: And I'd prefer the corners to be round.,1
Marketing: I kinda I like the potato look.,1
"Marketing: with the current remote controls, the universal ones, you have to press yeah, you have to press a code for TV.",1
"Marketing: I think if we had a locating device with the small one, I think that seems way more advanced.",1
Project Manager: But that will be all worked out in other meetings.,0
"Project Manager: that is Kate, for the working design.",1
"Project Manager: But, really teamwork were you two.",0
"User Interface: It is been a little bit difficult to make sure that it is handholdable, that the user can use it, you know, it is not too big.",0
Industrial Designer: because I think it is.,0
Project Manager: I will be able to not answer them.,0
Marketing: I mean remote controls can be thin bits.,0
"Marketing: One thing I would want to see is is can we can we get a lifetime guarantee on this product, a normal use guarantee, which means that this product, for the for the life of the life use, if it should have a technical problem, that we could re replace it at no cost? That was something I would be interested in.",1
Industrial Designer: And these are three different types of or two different types three different types of shapes you can have.,1
"User Interface: And yeah, the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n more functionalities, the answer was already no because of the last minute update.",1
"User Interface: Now this is a special, special feature which we have included.",0
Industrial Designer: It was a little confusion about my.,0
"Marketing: This is twice as important as the next finding, which is technologically innovative.",1
User Interface: And which you do not use.,0
"Project Manager: we well, we use the same file during the whole day, you can make new sheets by by pu puttin pressing on the blank button.",0
"Industrial Designer: Well, make it available in different colours, you mean?",1
"Marketing: Right, so that will be it.",0
Project Manager: we have been writing this up for m months.,0
"Industrial Designer: I think, it would not be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device, maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote.",1
"User Interface: though you i it would be necessary to have have a m have a ha have a mode for programming it without the computer, just in case there are there are still people left out there who do not have them yet.",0
"Project Manager: Or you know, a b a b a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button, then a side an s up, down type of thing, like on like on a DVD player.",1
"Project Manager: Well you could argue you might do it once a year, you would change,",1
"Project Manager: one concern with the rubber casing is that it would be rubber encapsulating all of these chips, diodes, delicate technology as.",0
"Industrial Designer: So, more research into that one.",1
Industrial Designer: and to reflect about it.,0
Project Manager: And it is not too complex to do it.,0
"Project Manager: yeah, not the b the watch kind.",0
"Industrial Designer: I think it is easier to use than a regular remote control, because when you push on the options menu, you get the various options entirely explained.",1
Marketing: And the third one is easy to use.,1
"Project Manager: We have to close this to finish this meeting, so.",0
"Project Manager: Well maybe there should be a separate button apart from the LCD,",1
Industrial Designer: Maybe our personal coach will have something to say about that.,0
User Interface: So if we can have a higher priced remote control I think that would really be worth something that would be worth implementing.,0
User Interface: And we are actua actually making a better profit than we expected.,0
"Industrial Designer: So you are right we can see in our R, D if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy.",0
"User Interface: as what it, the major findings market researchers have said, it is the image, the appearance that people di dislike.",1
Project Manager: You do not see it at the ears?,0
Marketing: That does not fit in with the whole vegetable theme though.,0
"Marketing: And, yeah that they have lots of personality, be fit, in robust good health.",0
"Marketing: This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification, prototype design that meets the criteria that we got from our market research.",0
"Project Manager: So that if that was in the voice recognition, that would be great.",1
"Project Manager: So twenty five Euro you expect a quite, well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control.",1
Industrial Designer: Not in depth.,1
"Marketing: They are never gonna come back, buy it.",0
"Industrial Designer: So we need to have some energy source to do what to do the functions, what we want on this portable device.",1
"User Interface: We are forgetting about that now, but.",1
User Interface: I'm just gonna go through the interface concept with yous now.,1
"Industrial Designer: With a scroll menu, a w scroll thing, a LCD.",1
"Project Manager: Trendy design, compact, strong.",0
"Project Manager: Like as of yet, that has nothing to do with, the way it will look.",0
"Project Manager: But, do w gonna gonna are we going to give it a twotone colour look, like the plastic mould is in one colour, the s the cushion pads around it are in another colour? Is that the idea? Is that a good idea?",0
Project Manager: but that is good.,0
User Interface: Well I will draw what I had drawn on the screen.,0
"User Interface: At the side, or something like that.",0
"Project Manager: That is true, but that is what we stick under the menu button.",1
"Project Manager: In that moment it has a sensor, i it gets a certain darkness, it ge has a sensor, it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep,",0
"Project Manager: you each have individual actions, I ID Industrial Design you have your components concept, User Interface, the user interface concept, market trend wa watching.",1
"Project Manager: That is just for the case material,",0
"User Interface: So, if we are trying to keep costs down, then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go.",1
"Project Manager: Is it better? When you the menu, you have to go there.",0
"User Interface: But the thing that I find most interesting about this remote control, it is kind of difficult to to see in the slide, but it has a scroll wheel on it, which is kind of like a mouse scroll wheel, which I think is it is a really kind of important design aspect is it is 'Cause the thing is what a what we the presen this presentation we had is what we want the remote control to actually do.",1
"Marketing: So I dunno if there is something that diff, you know like five different face plates.",1
"Project Manager: under marketing we targeted our audience, yeah.",1
Industrial Designer: Twelve point three five.,1
"Marketing: Well you can see here, our target group would not do that.",1
Project Manager: you need a smart board application I think.,0
Project Manager: and the next big thing is the finance.,1
"Marketing: I had one of those, my brother, my dad, could have beat me up.",1
"Marketing: like question, is remote big enough, we can say it is true or it is false by steps.",0
Marketing: Instead of the current functional lookandfeel.,0
Industrial Designer: I dunno where she.,0
Project Manager: Well apparently now I write the final report.,1
"Project Manager: Yeah, that was a bit mean to put it in the end.",1
Project Manager: Do you have more to your presentation?,0
"User Interface: Fewer buttons, simpler to use, if ten percent is hidden away if ten percent is what is used, maybe the other fifty percent, the buttons that are used very rarely like programming, they could be hidden maybe under some remote controls you might have come across have maybe a little flip thi thing where they are hidden away.",1
Industrial Designer: No 'cause it is samples sens sample speaker.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yes, that is really possible.",0
Industrial Designer: So I will say two.,1
Project Manager: It is very promising.,0
Project Manager: So s four?,0
Industrial Designer: And we seem to have least something in each criteria.,0
"Project Manager: first is the functional design, this is where we all go off, do our individual work, what needs need to be fulfilled by the product, what effects the product has to have, how it is actually going to do that.",1
"User Interface: So using some LCDs we can touch, so we can remove keys, just having, I dunno the name, LCD responding to fingers.",1
User Interface: So we should make it too complex.,0
"User Interface: Because all the TV sets will be digital, right.",1
"Project Manager: Then we will take the decision on the remote control needed functions, then I will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting.",0
"Marketing: you do not normally have a car,",0
"User Interface: They want something that looks nice, that is not gonna break when they drop it, that you know that maybe it is ergonomic, it feels good in your hand, something like that.",1
"Marketing: I do not know, I mean I guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable.",1
Industrial Designer: But then we come to the costs.,1
"Project Manager: bright funky designs inspired by fruit, keeping with the hip kind of feel.",1
Project Manager: But then again you do not want you know like the first mobile phone that was this big.,0
"Industrial Designer: that dif batteries right, Batteries go weak as well, so after a while you have to point it towards the towards the equipment you wanna control with it, right? So, have to m show which is the front, which is the back.",0
"Project Manager: And plus these two, f plus the mute button, it is will be eighteen.",1
Project Manager: so now we are on the conceptual design meeting.,1
Project Manager: First a little about the project aim.,1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, I think an LCD screen might be good in theory, but not as useful in practice.",1
"User Interface: This is our remote control, with the flip panel as you can see.",1
Industrial Designer: it is chos So that should be hard plastic.,1
Industrial Designer: But I think that that collides with our mission to make it very cheap.,0
User Interface: So I think all three groups will need to interact quite a bit.,1
"Project Manager: It is an uni an unique feature,",0
"Industrial Designer: I'm Manuel, I'm the Industrial Designer in this project.",0
"Marketing: but I feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming, use the board well, this would have been six months' worth of work, not like three hours' worth of meetings.",1
Project Manager: I think it would be simpler.,1
Marketing: And that is on the camera.,0
"Project Manager: and who we all are, stuff like that, get bit more of an idea together of what is going on.",0
User Interface: we just chose simple shapes for all them.,1
Project Manager: for many reasons.,0
Industrial Designer: That happened to me all the time though.,0
"User Interface: there is an a athe aesthetic value, but not functionality.",1
"Marketing: Then And the second thing, some companies they think that they should have more, more functions of the users or in their remote controls, but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want, what they operate, rather than making it too complicated.",1
Marketing: It is gotta be lowcost or highcost with special design features.,0
"Industrial Designer: Well y you have also the language problem,",0
"Marketing: Actually had a cable between it, the TV.",0
Project Manager: so we have this at the moment.,0
Marketing: Sometimes they play a movie.,0
Industrial Designer: Do you want to present it?,0
"User Interface: Yeah, like up, down, left, right.",0
"Project Manager: But you have to fill in this column, huh?",0
"User Interface: So if you lift up the panel, you can see the lovely yellow LCD display.",1
Industrial Designer: Deadlines were sometimes very short.,0
Marketing: And you need a you need a speaker.,0
Marketing: is that appropriate? You are saying the triple A batteries are small or the surrounding it?,0
"Marketing: And we do not w I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical,",1
User Interface: So remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station.,1
Industrial Designer: there is also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things.,0
"Project Manager: we have new project requirements, we are not going to be using teletext,",1
Industrial Designer: and that is the back of the interface.,0
"User Interface: And then changeable fonts, so.",1
"User Interface: But th Yeah, that can be very simple.",1
Project Manager: I will for industrial design.,1
User Interface: Though it would have been nice to be able to transfer the transfer our n our paper notes onto the computer ourselves.,0
"User Interface: Or just leave it? could make an a volume button scroll, volume button.",0
"User Interface: Because So it works like good morning remote control, then the remote control says good morning.",0
"Project Manager: but only the I think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control, it makes it a lot easier as well.",1
User Interface: So you'd have to have like.,0
"Project Manager: Although I think we yeah, but we could still make a remote control that ap applies more to young people by giving it another colour already.",1
Industrial Designer: And three D curved is also in depth.,1
"User Interface: So we need to know all the different you know all the different signals, so that will require some memory as well.",0
User Interface: No rubber buttons or something.,1
"Industrial Designer: and basically it can have a flat surface, a curved surface or a double curved surface, but I think if we wanna use standard components, we are gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that.",1
Industrial Designer: But you might as well do it in normal computer style.,1
"Industrial Designer: In fact, I will give it some more.",0
"Project Manager: one thing that we have almost not talked about at all, my apologies for that, user interface, we also need to maybe get the slogan in here, it is,",1
"Project Manager: we want to know to at the end to know the new project is requirement so we need to know the user needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the from the technical part we want to know how it going to work, third part I do not remember.",0
"Marketing: and if it is was not edible then Well, normal babies.",0
"User Interface: When you saw th li Earlier when we selected it, w I could not erase anything.",0
"Project Manager: well see you all in about thirty minutes, then.",1
"Industrial Designer: This one is, I suppose for the younger audiences.",1
Project Manager: Put it in there wire on it.,0
Industrial Designer: but the prices I read are high.,0
Industrial Designer: so that gives us a more trendy look as well.,0
"Marketing: But you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom, tells you what is on.",0
"Project Manager: So And after that we have to make decisions, what we will do.",1
"User Interface: Well, I do not ha really have much to add, because most of things we already said in the previous discussion.",0
"User Interface: with a m yeah, w if we dis, when we s discussed that we might like this flipping open thing, then I mean y you can use it as a normal remote control,",1
"Project Manager: Is the project evaluated? We are all happy that it meets all the criteria,",0
"Marketing: Yes, further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is, it is gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who is sixty.",1
"Project Manager: We could just have the logo in yellow,",1
Marketing: In the middle.,1
"Project Manager: General project, what is i in For example, I thou I thought we were pretty creative in what we created.",1
"Industrial Designer: Well the thing is, if it was had an alarm system,",0
Industrial Designer: There are a few buttons connected.,0
"User Interface: But if you are programming the colour of the TV, do not display twenty other options that are possible.",0
"Marketing: So what I have, wh where I have got my information from is a survey where the usability lab observed remote control use with a hundred subjects, then they gave them a questionnaire.",1
"Marketing: And again these are all things we have kind of already come up with on our own, but this just backs it up.",1
Industrial Designer: But do not we wanna make the background the bright colo colours? So th the total of the thing is very bright?,0
"Marketing: When we did f fashions, recent fashion our recent fashion update shows that.",0
"User Interface: Not that we actually know anything about it,",1
"User Interface: Would you be able to, put the little device anywhere? 'Cause is not our remote control for all TVs, so.",1
Marketing: You have to you have to Because some fat people with d thick fingers will press three buttons at same time.,1
"Marketing: Yeah, but then you have to choose the always with r universal remotes you have to choose the code.",1
"Project Manager: further yes we must think, do we stay to television only, the television as we as we all know it with broadcasting signals, you ca not go back h, or do we go further as Matthew indicated by supporting recording devices?",1
"Marketing: There were six true or ones, four pardon me, two s almost true or close to true, so that was four points, then one false, seven points, so seventeen divided by nine we are between one, two.",1
Industrial Designer: 'Cause if it is just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of a mobile phone.,0
Project Manager: I will go back to my own presentation.,0
"Industrial Designer: I also think that th f the feel of it is, when you hold it, is something that was expressed more in my design.",1
"Project Manager: We decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it, because we have international appeal, we said it is for all age groups, different functions of it.",1
"Project Manager: so another important part of the project is about money, about so about finances.",1
"Project Manager: It is more true than false, about a two.",1
Marketing: current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user.,0
Marketing: The second most important aspect is that a remote sh that the remote control should be technologically innovative.,0
Industrial Designer: With the articulators.,0
"Marketing: And neither did the older generation, but the younger generation who we are catering for, like who have most of the money nowadays, do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote.",1
Marketing: considering the little amount of input we had going in.,1
User Interface: So the s a button less.,0
Industrial Designer: So you are more likely to b.,0
"User Interface: a regular chip, which is like the medium porridge the medium expense.",1
Industrial Designer: another thing I think we d missed out on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design.,0
Industrial Designer: This would actually show the circuit diagram.,1
"Industrial Designer: And that would probably, I d, well what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design.",1
"User Interface: The bu the mute button to switch the volume on, o on, off.",1
User Interface: Well it is kinda both of us.,0
"Marketing: Now I think it'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all TVs, you know you s you click a button, it finds the frequency that works with your particular television.",1
User Interface: Because it it is not it is not it is not difficult.,0
"Project Manager: Pretty much kept to the company strategy, so I would go for a a one, as we not only kept it, but we were limited by.",1
"Marketing: I do not know whether it is one of those things that like sort of having all fruit shaped keys, that probably would go out of fashion very quickly,",0
"Project Manager: Well a worry that was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would e it would effect how long how long it took us to get this to market, so I th suspect it might be a good idea just to restrict our kind of our creative influence on this on the user interface, not worry so much about how we transmit it.",0
Marketing: Some things that I drew from this are that I think we were correct.,1
Marketing: Then we did some research to the most relevant functions.,1
"Project Manager: speech recognition potentially, flat screen interface, LCD interface we also want to limit the nber of buttons so we will pretty much take that one as read.",1
"Project Manager: Just give five with them, just in a box.",1
"Industrial Designer: which yeah would have all of all of the available functions for the remote on it, whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons, like the vo volume up, down, channel up, down, power on, off, things to that effect.",0
Marketing: And we can make special features.,0
Industrial Designer: There is a user interface here.,1
"Project Manager: Anyway, we will take this project in three steps, three pha three phase of design.",0
Marketing: We only actually needed one computer.,1
"User Interface: But is our research about bi large LCD sh display, or just a small one we want to use?",0
Industrial Designer: The one at the top.,0
Industrial Designer: It is not a microphone.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, you can also do that, but maybe.",0
Marketing: I mean working remotes we already have.,1
Marketing: That is my dic that is my presentation.,0
Industrial Designer: For a TV the most important feature which I felt was the locator which is a cool feature.,1
Industrial Designer: could put it at one or two I would say.,0
"User Interface: And use friendly, yeah.",0
"User Interface: I dunno if you should take that in consideration, or that you just should aim for the normal TVs.",0
Project Manager: There are a few but in general not.,0
Project Manager: So you are User Interface guy.,1
"User Interface: but they both say V on them,",1
Project Manager: Use pen format.,1
"Project Manager: But it can be battery consuming, no? To have the light always on?",0
Industrial Designer: I dunno what you were talking about but.,0
User Interface: I do not know.,0
"Industrial Designer: so push buttons for the traditional users so that they do not feel they are alienated, just a scroll button with push technology for channel selection, volume control, teletext browsing.",0
Project Manager: did we decide on a chip? Let is go with a simple chip?,0
Marketing: But I do not think that is really an issue any more 'cause Well might be.,0
User Interface: And everyone is gonna be satisfied.,0
Marketing: Yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five.,1
"User Interface: And were there any factors that were not important in the survey, that they said we do not want?",0
Marketing: then the methodology I adopted to find out all this was market survey.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah I know, but if I wanna go to say number like sixty five, channel sixty five, if I press the six it will go to channel six, then I will press the plus, then it will go to six, then put the five, it will go to sixty five?",1
"Project Manager: Few buttons, we talked about that.",1
"Project Manager: but what, what are other tef technical things we have to discuss?",0
Marketing: We already discussed that.,1
"Project Manager: But wha th our basic idea y I mean, you gonna we are probably gonna have like two type of materials, like the d b the plastic enclosure, then the pads that surround it.",1
Industrial Designer: It is not just straight.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, the they are big, clear.",0
User Interface: it but you actually got to write on the paper.,1
"Industrial Designer: and it is quite conventional, sometimes people do not like too much flashy colours like this one presented here.",0
"User Interface: and, I think that has given a proven ease of use, what not.",0
Industrial Designer: Plastic covered with rubber.,1
"Industrial Designer: Although customisation, because this is being done, you know, the on onorder basis, it might be the quantity wo not m wo not.",1
Industrial Designer: and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the TV.,1
Project Manager: Any other immediate thoughts before we move along?,0
"Project Manager: the only thing we have to look after is that we use different colours, different line width.",0
"Marketing: So you can say, you can.",0
"Project Manager: Well, this is the agenda for today.",1
"Marketing: Well that is an idea of course, yeah.",0
"User Interface: Not not yellow, but just a bit of light yellow.",0
"Marketing: Lose a little bit on the fashion, yeah, but.",1
"Industrial Designer: Well I think that is a very interesting idea, but I'm not a very good industrial designer, I do not know much about what these things cost.",0
"Project Manager: It was very productive day,",0
"User Interface: Well, I kinda think if we are gonna have the voice recognition for part of it, then maybe we should have it for the whole thing.",1
Project Manager: You have another meeting soon?,0
User Interface: Whereas I think the aim is to take away buttons.,1
"Marketing: PlayDoh wo not last very long everybody will go like, oops, it is gone.",0
"Industrial Designer: We'd also have to wor consider that who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes, we might wanna learn about labour laws.",0
"User Interface: personally wa what I want from a remote control is a device that is simple, it it is easy to use, it is got big buttons for doing the things I do most often, changing the volume, changing the channel.",1
"Project Manager: It is good to visualise everything, but I think the response time should could be a lot better.",0
Industrial Designer: So that is one the those are the choices we have to make.,0
Marketing: and then you can use it again.,0
"Industrial Designer: When the recharger has a has a bit what points out, we can place all on top of it.",1
"Industrial Designer: But we are thinking that, seeing as we are having it in interchangeable casing anyway, that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use.",1
"User Interface: so I did some research on the internet, what you know, the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users, commands, mechanisms for the operation, there are just kind of a variety of choices.",0
"Project Manager: first we going over the minutes of the last meeting, more or less.",1
"User Interface: Just the look like, the button part I will explain.",0
Marketing: but selling price is is that wholesale or retail? Like on the shelf.,0
"Industrial Designer: And when you push the button, it will will be sent to the chip.",1
"Project Manager: and we can make it yellow, that is pretty much banana like.",1
"Industrial Designer: Or you know you lose it, it lies behind the couch for a week.",0
Industrial Designer: Say it for the camera.,0
Project Manager: So that is something we can discuss as well.,0
User Interface: You have to decide.,0
"Marketing: y you lose the banana, you press a button, you hear like monkey screams or something like that to direct you towards the banana.",1
"Marketing: Technologically it should be like work, basically, I guess.",0
"User Interface: Are we still you say we are focusing on TV, but is it still a kind of like a universal remote in that it is a replacement remote control, or is this something for our own line of televisions?",0
"User Interface: At the same time, it is m more like it would be more interesting for people who are having this RSI, all problem.",1
"Marketing: And by making it multipurpose, it has a new feature, adds a new feature to the market, distinguish from from current products.",1
"User Interface: Yeah, that is a possibility,",0
Project Manager: I would say a two.,1
"User Interface: Then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep, 'cause that will feed into both Ed is work, Christine is work.",1
"Marketing: so if we add approximately two to three Euro per remote, now we are up around about twelve, twelve, a half as to what the company had initially requested.",1
"Project Manager: yeah I like that I like the idea of putting the logo in the boot up screen, nice.",1
"Industrial Designer: I think people who are maybe about I would not say thirty five,",0
User Interface: I have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect.,1
"Marketing: The younger market likes Well, the themes of this year are surprisingly fruits, vegetables, spongy material.",0
Project Manager: And then you can Yeah.,0
Project Manager: So we can discuss these points.,1
User Interface: I hope that is not too much.,0
"Industrial Designer: personal preferences, I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal, the company simply ca not afford this kinds of lawsuits.",1
User Interface: Instead of a stick.,1
User Interface: So we are under the budget.,1
Industrial Designer: Because infrared is not visible.,0
"User Interface: Yeah 'cause we wanna incorporate a bit of colour if we can, once we find out.",1
"Project Manager: No hand dynamo, right?",1
"User Interface: But I think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design, po possibly within maybe the budget that we do it, because you'd need to know all the spef specifications of a all the like electronic companies.",1
User Interface: what is the function? Yeah f for loading up the batteries.,0
Industrial Designer: I think so too.,1
"Marketing: And this would, could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep.",1
Project Manager: Yes of course it will be a we get a if it works we can get aftersales.,0
Marketing: I would give that a three.,1
Project Manager: S Any other questions or comments to be discuss?,0
Project Manager: We need the advanced chip.,1
"Project Manager: other things were we were hoping to use rubber, most likely gonna be double curved, etcetera.",1
User Interface: That th there is no display there.,1
"Industrial Designer: The case le that is what I wrote first of all, could be plastic our plastic.",1
"Marketing: One two three four five, si.",0
Project Manager: If you leave out the LC display.,1
"Project Manager: Well, welcome to the kickoff meeting.",1
"Project Manager: we have got the functional design, conceptual design, detailed design which basically is the three of you.",0
"Industrial Designer: I would not have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first, in like on the way to channel sixty five.",1
"Industrial Designer: we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet, so or something like that.",1
User Interface: We need to start by considering what a remote control actually is.,0
"User Interface: But you know we can we can discuss this, but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general, but done well.",1
Project Manager: And our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty.,1
"Marketing: So you can pick up, use it, than I think.",1
Marketing: furthermore the learning time is a problem.,0
"Marketing: then like a locator, so you know, kind of like you have for a mobile phone or.",1
Project Manager: Aquaintance is a point we have done a bit.,0
User Interface: I think possibly it might be more useful if Kate went next.,1
Industrial Designer: Under documents in the shared folder.,1
"Project Manager: I think you can email me, if there is any more questions.",1
"Project Manager: or maybe, you are my coordinator, am I right?",1
"Project Manager: Functional is not an issue, then easy to use.",1
"User Interface: And I thought the button for teletext apar apart because it is not really options, I think.",0
"Industrial Designer: I did get a bit more done than the last time,",0
Project Manager: So we that means we need a button on th on the on the basis.,1
Industrial Designer: People'd be real upset.,0
"User Interface: We could assign any button a command to any button, if we have enough processing power,",1
"Industrial Designer: So th I think this is just like gonna be the a very outer case, which we will decide on rubber.",0
"User Interface: A pi There is that box in the TV, so with the set box you can connect internet with your TV.",0
"Project Manager: It was a management decision,",1
"Industrial Designer: So, if finally the TV breaks, you get a new one, you are gonna have to be able to tune it.",1
"Marketing: Between the age of fifteen, twenty five, most people would be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software.",1
"Marketing: No, do totally.",0
Project Manager: because your finger is on top.,0
Industrial Designer: That is possible too.,1
"Project Manager: if you need any coordination in between compared to the maybe the some technical vendors or commercial vendors, depends if you want to have some marketing plan or technical plan, so you let me know.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah th yeah, the chip is the regular one.",1
Marketing: Would that imply video use?,0
"Project Manager: No, it was up there, but I could not see it down here.",0
"Marketing: Besides, you have four sides to a thing, so I mean does curved one side mean one side is straight.",1
"Industrial Designer: Well, the smartboard, the d drawing is just a pain in the ass, but The digital the digital pen is very nice.",1
"Marketing: I will tell something about the way this this test was, yeah, done.",0
Project Manager: so it is not quite But well I have to do it.,0
Marketing: I think so.,0
"Marketing: Yeah, I mean that is the thing is that it did not say in the survey, you know, whether, you know, these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control,",1
"Marketing: No, we have t we have to change the end cost.",1
"Project Manager: chip on print, case.",1
"Project Manager: means, whiteboard, digital pens, etcetera, what does that mean? Any ideas?",0
"Marketing: Put one option, then you have the all the buttons of that options, so the other options would be gone.",0
"User Interface: you can you can l let choose the customer which colour he wants, yeah.",0
"Marketing: so I suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price, we d or is it going to make our product look a cheapiecheapie option?",0
Industrial Designer: And then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition.,1
"User Interface: ID, UID work together on prototype drawing on smart board.",0
"Marketing: twenty five Euros, I think we can make it.",1
User Interface: Or combine both with a with one.,0
"Industrial Designer: cause we wanna appeal to the to the young public with fancy with flashy colours, with a lot of shape.",1
Project Manager: And what is the sample sensor slash sample speaker?,0
"Project Manager: So, it has to be soft?",0
Marketing: It would cost more than plastic.,0
