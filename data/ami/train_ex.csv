Source,Summary
Project Manager: And product evaluation.,1
"Marketing: Try it, yeah maybe.",0
"Project Manager: I mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it, so, you know.",1
"User Interface: And basically it depends like the remote with LCD display for browsing because you have multiple functionalities for example you are watching a movie, you are having a universal remote control, you want to you do not know really which functionality is now, so I am using the TV so every time I use it, it could be like, for example I can use a simple toggle switch, a display, so I press it so the display says, I'm in TV or DVD or whatever it is, instead of having three keys separately for four keys,",1
Project Manager: Maybe you can look how much it is for the LCD.,0
"Industrial Designer: I think controlling is not the right word, I think the interactions are very structured.",1
Project Manager: They cost us all the same.,0
"Industrial Designer: May fail though, every here, there.",1
"Project Manager: So big buttons, flashy design, maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing.",1
Project Manager: It does not tell me.,0
"Industrial Designer: I do not think there is a sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a, like a consensus right, we go around, we think about it,",1
Industrial Designer: is that a function we want in the remote?,0
Marketing: Same sort of function? The criteria? It is alright.,0
Project Manager: let me see.,0
Industrial Designer: Something what also younger people want.,1
User Interface: do not use my opinion.,0
Industrial Designer: to something which is maybe more universal.,1
Project Manager: Right well this is the kickoff meeting for our project.,0
Marketing: Let is go on then.,0
User Interface: Like you said before.,0
"Marketing: we can make it brown, dark brown, not wood.",1
Project Manager: I think it is not too expensive.,0
Marketing: You had different remote controls for different devices.,1
"Marketing: but ninety one percent, fifteen to twenty five.",1
Marketing: So we can launch it.,1
Project Manager: so I will I let David Jordan do his presentation.,0
"Industrial Designer: The second version is also simpler, we d we had just I have to put the microphone also.",1
Industrial Designer: So at least seven to seven.,0
"Marketing: We could make things much more f I think the eighty percent of people would spend more on a remote that looks better, combined with decrease the or take out the limited functio functions that we do not really use much.",0
Project Manager: And would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition?,1
"Marketing: Like I do not know if they would actually go out, purchase this themselves, a fifteen year old you know.",1
Project Manager: but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer.,0
Project Manager: what is a hand dynamo?,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, two years' time this will be on the market.",0
Project Manager: I would say a two.,1
Project Manager: let is call this to an end.,0
"Marketing: One is fancy look, second is innovative, third is easy to use.",1
Industrial Designer: So maybe there is like a set design which we get printed off.,0
"Project Manager: But you do mention the next, previous button.",0
"Marketing: normally you only every use, you know, on a TV remote you only ever use, mostly, you know, f four or f six buttons.",1
"Industrial Designer: Why would you put it then, where is the recording the microphone?",0
"User Interface: No, tha that w that w that would be more promising.",0
"Marketing: So maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use, trendy, fancy, feels good, with a display, wood, designer wood, designer colours.",1
Marketing: ease of use.,1
Project Manager: I'm gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders.,1
"Marketing: Yeah but you know the average frequency of pushing buttons, it is about.",0
"Project Manager: Twelve, a half Euros is what supposed to cost us.",0
User Interface: You have to do it over.,1
Project Manager: But remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the.,0
Industrial Designer: I'm the Industrial Designer.,1
"Project Manager: Right, we are gonna try out the electronic whiteboards.",0
"Marketing: Because we decided to have two kind of remotes, two designs, or was it two colours?",1
"Marketing: Hey, what what is the company colour? Did you get told what the company colour is or.",0
User Interface: like it is just been brought up again then.,0
User Interface: So you so you move to the next the next one.,1
Industrial Designer: Or we can do something like that.,1
Project Manager: Thank you very much.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five,",1
User Interface: We will not use this.,1
Industrial Designer: and discuss it in the next meeting.,0
"User Interface: So you generally see rectangular shape, very monotonous kind of designs here.",1
"Industrial Designer: Because we have tried to make it a little bit innovative,",0
"Marketing: So, I would give this a five.",1
User Interface: what is the purpose of the light?,0
Project Manager: I do not see any power cables here so.,0
Project Manager: Because we have to decide this.,0
"Project Manager: we want it to be original, something that is people have not thought of, that is not out in the shops, trendy, appealing to a wide market, but you know, not a hunk of metal, userfriendly, grannies to kids, maybe even pooches should be able to use it.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, a little bit.",1
Industrial Designer: I'm just thinking totally different designs also.,1
Project Manager: It is the little blue w it is the one th.,0
User Interface: and would cost us to build it about eight Euros.,0
Project Manager: So we need to calculate the production cost.,1
Marketing: Yeah but if you shape it.,0
Marketing: fifty percent I think of all these nbers the most important is fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons.,1
Industrial Designer: Fr I mean the never mind.,0
"Project Manager: but if we all have a think, when we go away from the meeting, what specific things could be included in this remote control that are out of the ordinary.",1
"Marketing: Well I have noticed that gaming c is becoming quite popular with television, when I was younger we used to e play games using our cable, using the cable subscribed the cable providers,",1
"Industrial Designer: I thought but this is really your department, that we need just the functional display, four cursors.",1
"Industrial Designer: This is incremental, but once you press it for a long time, you go five by five.",1
"Project Manager: I have got I think we should also have a backup plan of I 'cause I just think that it might be expensive to make something that I mean we do not, we have not been told it has to be something that will control everything.",0
Project Manager: that pen drawings.,0
"Project Manager: It is actually a novel thing because you could sell it a as a novelty, just to be actually serious for a minute here,",0
Project Manager: I think it was better to have this price list a bit earlier.,1
Marketing: It is your it is your job.,0
Project Manager: Yeah such as maybe the.,0
Marketing: Yeah e power supply is one of the most important things.,1
Project Manager: Or we can put these in the project folder as well.,0
"Marketing: No, it you did better.",1
"Marketing: And then it kinda there was a green, I think it was a green ring, there was like red going out like this.",0
Marketing: criteria four is costs.,1
"Project Manager: Yeah, the project is evaluated.",0
User Interface: but these are these are all necessary functions.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yes, but when you put that same volt voltages on it, you can put when the when the when o the lowest part of it, when it is o the same as the other products, you can put it all on the same.",1
"User Interface: the distance from your television to your remote control has to be, yeah yeah, quite a big distance.",1
"Marketing: they have like a touch screen with really big pictures on it like call hangup, that is a big ad advantage I think, because one the one hand you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by scaling up the pictures or something.",1
"Marketing: I guess the other option, referring to the battery thing is, you know how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds or something, when you are s, then it goes,",1
"User Interface: about yeah like yeah, a bit like radio presets.",0
"User Interface: You need to change channels, both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing.",1
Marketing: you only have channel button or volume button.,1
User Interface: Programming them can be a right pain.,1
"User Interface: in writing letters, of course, yeah? Yeah, normally, this the w Block letter sign it, yeah?",0
"User Interface: I mean there are there are advantages, disadvantages if you if you have an LCD display, it is nice, because it is it lets you just sort of sit there, st, control your television from your armchair.",0
Marketing: building games like Snake or Tetris to amuse the younger users.,1
User Interface: It is just a bird.,0
"Project Manager: The sample sensor, for speak recognition anyway.",0
"User Interface: 'Cause we have brought it down to basically four controls most common, which are channel, volume.",0
"Industrial Designer: So or maybe set it out in the sun, it, you know, gets, from the light, a solar cell inside there.",1
Project Manager: I will delete this one now because we do not use it yet.,0
"Industrial Designer: But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control, because it will just lie there for a long while sometimes.",1
Marketing: we did it w it was.,0
"User Interface: But It is r it is rather easy to use, because you have the primary buttons always visible.",1
Marketing: You have to push harder.,0
Marketing: It is not the most easy to use.,1
Project Manager: Yay I introduce to the world the amazing ant.,1
"Marketing: I have been thinking about this fruit, vegetable thing, I prefer fruits to vegetables,",0
Industrial Designer: And that will that would l would last for well I do I d I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I have never seen one run out.,0
"Marketing: And eighty percent of users, if we think about this there are a lot of television, DVD, stereo remote control users out there, eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy.",1
"User Interface: So, now I'd like to ask for your preferences.",1
Industrial Designer: Then you hold it in your hand like this.,1
User Interface: Shall I just turn it round for time?,0
"Project Manager: So I guess the case would be plastic, with Perhaps that is not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it.",1
Marketing: If you just make a control for just the TV there is just not much to gain here.,0
User Interface: That is people they actually do it themselves.,0
"Project Manager: I see, the onoff is in the back.",0
"Marketing: RSI is like, when you are using the same doing the same movement several times, then you get injured.",1
Industrial Designer: Like a very big scrollwheel.,1
Project Manager: And what is the acceptable criteria? Is there like a scale that we have to hit?,0
Marketing: What do you think? Two?,1
"Industrial Designer: It is not perfect, but.",0
Project Manager: at the end we will we will evaluate ourself as a team.,0
"Marketing: What they found is that people do not like how current remote controls are, so you know, definitely you should be looking at something quite different.",1
Project Manager: Yeah but this the is for the.,0
User Interface: I'm just saying that the currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f customisable for different people.,1
"Industrial Designer: Not so much an atmosphere, the atmosphere is very relaxed, but the gear.",0
Industrial Designer: It is gonna be very important to the company.,0
Project Manager: so I suppose the first to do the presentation will be the User Interface Designer.,1
User Interface: It is also green or.,0
"Project Manager: Yes, well i it should have the expected functionality of a remote control.",0
"User Interface: Well like since it just has the circle thing, you could make it a qui a kind of cool shape, like it could be a cool sort of you know, because it could be circular, you know, or something weird like that, just.",1
"Project Manager: We have a power button, setting buttons, LCD window, the number buttons.",1
Industrial Designer: It could be an ape.,0
"Project Manager: If you look closely, you can see.",0
"Project Manager: it is Yeah, but my opinion I think it is better under the flip because whenever you want to the talk, so then you can speak then you can close it.",1
"Marketing: We have talked about pointers, but the very use of a remote control, if you are someone who is zapping, who is sitting like that, we found so many people did, how do you minimise that on such a small device?",1
"Project Manager: Do we, do we make a light under the under the n under the numbers, everything? Do.",0
Project Manager: I'm really excited to start this team.,0
User Interface: We chose a different type of colour for the menu.,1
Project Manager: So both of those concepts.,1
"User Interface: They are right on your screen,",0
Project Manager: Yeah what I'm gonna I'm gonna put.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, it is a good option.",0
"Project Manager: So as you can see here, for example, the battery really not very little choice in that one.",1
Project Manager: I rounded it up far too fast.,0
Industrial Designer: A button for the subtitles.,1
Project Manager: Well we have to choose one of them.,1
"User Interface: And I thinked of the button sizes, I'm not sure if they have to be big or just small.",0
"Project Manager: I think basically you will get instructions to work with, if you have any questions, I guess, you can.",0
"Project Manager: Not so much that we were not full of ideas, but of ones that are gonna allow us to actually build the thing.",1
"Project Manager: so I understand when we want a display we need a expensive chip, but when we want a scrolling wheel w we also need the expensive chip, so can we use same chip, so with one expensive chip we can implement several complicated or advanced features.",1
"Industrial Designer: And I think our budget is too low to use, an LCD, the chip who is more expensive.",1
"User Interface: For example, if you are watching a French program, you would like to have a subtitles in English, then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see the the subtitles on the screen.",0
"Project Manager: So, we will have the three presentations from the In Industrial Designer, User Interface Designer,",1
Project Manager: this is a problem.,1
User Interface: I think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project.,1
"Project Manager: So, You must p push a little Good.",0
"Project Manager: You you D does not it work? Maybe someo Maybe maybe Anna, maybe you can start.",1
"Marketing: Yeah, we can b It c it could be just a square, just a packet.",0
"User Interface: So if that is your thing, you got something like that instead,",0
"Industrial Designer: I think it is also important to make it possible to how do you call it in English, to not use batteries, use ac bat batteries to to be.",1
Project Manager: I would say four.,1
Project Manager: A mouse is not too difficult.,0
User Interface: If the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough.,1
User Interface: Without affecting the circuit board.,1
"Industrial Designer: there is not a lot to wrong, the components are cheap to make.",0
Marketing: Is that so? Was it it was not just a prototype?,0
"Project Manager: Whereas it would be the special colour would be for the So you would only have the one special button that was rubber, whereas the rest would be hard plastic.",1
"Project Manager: That, Steph, is your part, is the userfriendliness.",1
Project Manager: it is not because I do not like you but.,0
"Industrial Designer: N wha what I have what I have seen, just not related to this, but of latex cases before, is that there is like a hard plastic inside, it is just covered with the latex.",1
"Industrial Designer: Now, well this is the idea about the bumps.",0
"Marketing: I'd rather just go to the board, get us to spend eighteen dollars a remote.",0
"Marketing: It is a bit sketchy at some times, you are not gonna get good always accurate results, but for a very fixed number of words, you know you have, how many different words can you have for a remote control, up, down, left, right, channel five, channel seven, you know, how many, you ca not have that many words.",1
"User Interface: so you must point everywhere, so maybe infrared is.",1
"User Interface: Maybe the buttons could like decrease in s the bigger ones you know they could actually be bigger in size than the ones that are less important, the smaller here.",1
"Project Manager: Unless this unless this part were raised, so say the cover flips over, covers that part.",0
"User Interface: I believe the But you have already you must have a red on, off button.",0
Project Manager: so do you want to.,0
Project Manager: So what are we going to to do? What are we going to make f kind of functions in the remote? And why are we going to do it? Then the conceptual design.,1
Industrial Designer: Well y you have this chip.,0
"Project Manager: I I'm not really sure how this works, but.",1
"Marketing: Drawing on the fashion trends at the moment, fruit, vegetables.",1
"Marketing: Yeah, the basics then by a volume, channel, one till two zero numbers on it,",1
"Marketing: For example, you can see below there, seventy five percent of users zap a lot,",1
Project Manager: This is our conceptual design meeting.,1
Project Manager: It is a pig.,0
Project Manager: If money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that.,1
Project Manager: Because the LCD has more support on customer side.,1
Marketing: So in part I could I could give you some of my personal preferences but I could also th add some to this which is just about sort of sort of market research.,0
Industrial Designer: A little bit.,1
"User Interface: Or from my perspective I think LCD is a mistake because this is a universal remote, all you are doing I mean it is you are not gonna get any information back from the television, so the only information you can display on this remote is what channel you just sent it at last, there is just not a lot of information, you know, there.",1
Project Manager: we have a financial aspect to this project.,1
"Marketing: well there has been inv investigation again, in the in the remote control market.",0
User Interface: and these two are to scroll the programme channels.,0
"User Interface: I mean people forget to put their cordless phones back on there,",1
"Project Manager: something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite obviously into the design,",0
"User Interface: So we just have it like add a menu button then for the various things needed,",1
"Industrial Designer: you have you had those balls, you know those stress balls where you bounce the ball, it, it lights up, it goes,",0
"Industrial Designer: And then the next slide just shows how the copper wires interact with the buttons, the rubber buttons, to get sent to the chip.",1
Marketing: but maybe we could incorporate that into the voice.,1
"Marketing: So sh completely changed our demographic there,",1
User Interface: I heard a beep go.,0
"Industrial Designer: It just explains how the process goes through, from a.",1
"Project Manager: I think this was very good,",0
Project Manager: I would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off.,1
"Project Manager: I guess we are supposed to discuss the prod the process of the project, how satisfied, it is alright.",0
"User Interface: If you make one big touch screen,",1
User Interface: Just something maybe if you ha if it had like if some kind of like light or something or lights around it.,1
Project Manager: But it might be something you could consider when you are thinking about shapes?,0
"Industrial Designer: I think the tools that they were given, the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they do not support collaboration, I think that is the word.",1
"Marketing: But So what do you think for it, usefulness?",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, just stuff that you wanna share, just put it in the in the project folder, like I put my presentation now.",1
"User Interface: But the iPod, etcetera, MP three players, mobile phones.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, m maybe we cho should put that on top, buttons we do not use on, in the bottom.",1
User Interface: So it would be cheaper to make.,1
Industrial Designer: So we have this.,0
Project Manager: They want the ergonomic ones.,1
Project Manager: You probably get a mail.,1
Marketing: The voice recognition thing is cool.,1
"Marketing: No you'd hold it you do not if you flip it open then you'd be Would not you? Is not that the idea? You us if we just use the shell as an example again, you open that, you have got your LCD display there, you have got the buttons there so you are holding it in the palm of your hand, yeah.",0
Project Manager: Craig do you wanna.,0
"User Interface: Something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form, which it would need to be to sort of conform to the shape of the hand more efficiently anyway.",1
"Industrial Designer: How about we do a a popup screen, like the laptop.",1
Industrial Designer: It seems like it should be more around two.,0
Marketing: which affected over a quarter of users.,0
"Project Manager: maybe what you can do is, both of you, you can come up with the prototype, the model.",1
"User Interface: So once we decide exactly what we want, then we can figure out the exact positioning, but more or less I think it should go along those lines.",0
Project Manager: Marketing they want product evaluation.,1
"User Interface: From the technical aspect, the processing should be done on the TV set than on the on the remote controller, right?",1
Marketing: Young means sixteen to forty years.,0
"Project Manager: we could do a slide or a compartment, you know, like if it say it is a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing, it'd be easy to have a compartment in there.",1
"Project Manager: Well literally if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than those on a a mobile phone,",0
"Project Manager: UID well yeah you right g your assignments are up there, you will also get s assignments from in your email as well more spec specifics on what do.",0
Project Manager: Should we actually bite the bullet here?,0
Marketing: If I if I need so.,0
"User Interface: what there is one more decisi one more solution in fact, 'cause there are some paints that can change colour according to where they are, like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around, like what colour is around, depending on the temperature,",1
"User Interface: Yeah it is well you can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys, you know right now if you take it you have like zero, one, two, three like a keys separately,",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah but the nonremovable elements of the of the remote, so not the front, could be titanium,",1
"User Interface: I'm Stephanie, I am the User Interface Designer.",1
Marketing: Hi I'm Guillermo.,1
"Project Manager: I do not know, but I think the single curved is good for design, also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control.",1
"Industrial Designer: So it kind of holds nicely, something like that.",0
"Project Manager: what about the case? I think they are talking there about do we want wood, plastic, titanium or rubber,",1
Industrial Designer: The drawing cap capabilities are very limited.,1
"User Interface: I think that was the main aim, one of the main aims that we had.",0
"User Interface: Yeah I think we it was a requirement that we use our th the colours of our company, so would it be like yellow, grey, black or something, or.",1
Project Manager: let is see.,0
Marketing: That is it.,0
"Industrial Designer: Maybe titani, maybe some wood.",1
"User Interface: Yeah, you think?",0
"User Interface: Yeah, the volume ones should stand out a bit.",1
"Project Manager: he here it is still doublecurve, the rubber, the flashy, the fruity, the removable.",1
Project Manager: So we just put something.,0
"Project Manager: Because if you hold it like this, the sensors will get blocked, then the drawing wo not get good.",1
Marketing: I also have copied a different type of remote.,0
Industrial Designer: So these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people? Or it is.,0
User Interface: Well y we have curves in all directions.,1
Marketing: so I Are we going to write off the LCD option?,0
"Industrial Designer: yeah, they are all they are not connected to anything on the table, you just leave 'em on, walk around with 'em.",0
"Industrial Designer: whether they would figure the the s sample senor, the sample speaker, voice recognition be sort of a worthwhile thing to have.",0
Industrial Designer: I think it is pretty much the same sort of connection.,0
"Marketing: So elephants are big, strong, gentle, they have great memories, they begin with the letter E, just like Ebenezer.",0
"Industrial Designer: It might even be one, a bit more complex LCD panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the, you know, the symbols of the various functions.",1
Project Manager: Because it was important for young customers if you remember.,0
Project Manager: I'm sure your personal coach will give you more information on that.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah no, for su for sure because I'm will now type them out.",1
Project Manager: I will just review what we did in our last meeting.,1
"User Interface: I would propose this concept for design, just few buttons, a screen with a back light which can change colours, titanium.",1
"User Interface: And this one, the oversized one, I do not know about you, but I think it is a bit too gimmicky.",1
Project Manager: I mean th certainly.,0
Project Manager: It is not yet a standard development those so.,0
"Industrial Designer: So w single curved? let is say would be a b square box, but then with curves on one dimension.",1
Industrial Designer: then you have to shake it all when it is when it is empty.,0
"Project Manager: So maybe we think we can think more about that, discuss that maybe last time next time.",0
User Interface: that would only add buttons.,0
User Interface: A remote control without the ten digits.,1
Project Manager: this is a bit pity for the Marketing Expert.,0
Project Manager: We will open that when the time is right.,0
"Project Manager: So, turning channel, of course.",0
User Interface: So but I think that is something we need to work on next time is really finding out more about the target market.,0
"Industrial Designer: We have, we have done well.",0
Marketing: Yeah so but th that is kind of standard T television so it also works on that.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, what about price, is that gonna go on there as well? Price of materials.",1
"Industrial Designer: I believe it is ins it is gotta be inside the TV, not inside the remote.",1
"Industrial Designer: Something which is not squarey maybe, not a box.",1
"Project Manager: And then w yeah, then we could have it, but it is its' well it is r it is the main point of the look.",0
Project Manager: Yeah but I do not I think it They are two different things though.,1
"Marketing: But maybe the buttons, all buttons in red is maybe a bad contrast for colourblind people.",1
Marketing: Twenty five Euro for a remote control.,1
"Project Manager: Especially the big ones, the big brands,",1
Marketing: Yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells.,1
Marketing: What else can we need?,0
"User Interface: We already have the beeping of the home station,",0
"Marketing: But if you can imagine that they say A, B, C, D, then that would be really good.",1
Project Manager: We we are definitely going to have to.,0
Project Manager: And we can all work on our own projects.,0
Industrial Designer: Yeah we have to kind of work together.,1
"Project Manager: for the moment not yet, but what is your do you have some project plan, something with you or.",1
"Project Manager: I mean not necessarily that the the whole body has to be of the company colour, so you know blue, yellow tend to go to we well together.",1
"Project Manager: the iPod, we really liked the look of that.",1
Marketing: Do you have any data on how much different prints cost? I mean can you get the entire thing printed with a design?,0
"Industrial Designer: So people are used to that kind of shape,",1
Project Manager: And the screen is disfmarer.,0
"Project Manager: So we are really probably, in terms of marketing, are looking for that is that is a cost winner rather than a fantastic new feature product.",1
Marketing: The remote control is easy to be found.,1
"User Interface: But we already have the scrollwheels, the sp the speaker the speak recognition, the rubber, the fancy colours.",1
"Marketing: So we have the choice between rubber, plastic.",0
"Marketing: So we are showing our preference for particular fruits,",1
Project Manager: The people have to keep buying.,0
Marketing: He is crying because it is ugl because of his ugliness.,0
"Project Manager: So, I will invite Christine to discuss about the functional design.",0
"Marketing: So even if they are only watching four or five channels, I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels,",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, that is good.",0
Project Manager: from twelve fifty if we d wanna get our fift hundred per cent profit margin that would mean selling it from twenty five.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, we could make an a separate menu on the LCD screen for teletext.",1
"Marketing: So, I mean, if you are watching a movie, suddenly there is a dark some dark scene, the lights adapt themself.",1
Marketing: No you are not connected to me anymore.,0
"Project Manager: and new ideas found, again gi no given relatively everyday product, I think we have v very very effectively come up with a new.",1
"Marketing: If this is our docking station, we can make our logo over here.",1
"Industrial Designer: The display requires a advanced chip, which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip.",1
"Marketing: I think this is going back to the graph at the beginning that I made, where, you know, the buttons that people use all the time, you want buttons for them, everything else menudriven.",1
Industrial Designer: so I guess the rest of it.,0
Industrial Designer: No just kidding.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind, we could make tons of money, I think.",1
User Interface: That is what people want to do.,0
Project Manager: it is below the budget.,0
Industrial Designer: But we lose the locator.,1
"Marketing: but I think we do not have a specific audience, you know, like what is our target audience, what niche are niche are we trying to market, corner.",1
"Marketing: But I think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting, especially if we are going after a younger market,",1
"Industrial Designer: Findings which were the required materials for the basic internal construction, so all the really simplistic functions that we just discussed, we need rubber for buttons, alini for battery y contacts, integrated circuit which consists of a diode, transistor, resonator, resistors, a capacitator, all those basic things that make a circuit function.",1
"User Interface: So you can you can design an interface which is very simple, which is userfriendly.",1
"User Interface: We do not have to follow every trend, I guess.",0
"Marketing: Well I had the cat as well, but I have got a spare one.",0
"Marketing: right? Always, so I dunno what w what we have to decide about that.",1
Industrial Designer: well you can go from doublecurved to singlecurved.,0
Project Manager: is there anything anybody is unsure about?,0
"Industrial Designer: They also like straightforward shapes, luxurious style.",0
Marketing: The user will just be able to say please can you pump up the vo pump up the volume.,0
User Interface: It should not be completely like a cube.,0
"Project Manager: It should be on your desktop, so on the.",0
"User Interface: So then basically it has to have some way to get to get to a mode on the television where you are doing,",0
Industrial Designer: Normal rubber I think.,1
"Project Manager: I do not suppose we have got any statistics on the life expectancy of remote controls, particularly sort of independent ones.",1
Industrial Designer: It is just a s shape so it does not matter.,0
Marketing: I closed it.,0
"User Interface: I have done a presentation, but it pretty much covers work that we have both done, so if I'm missing anything, Christine can just correct me.",1
Project Manager: so maybe we can stay with wood.,1
Project Manager: maybe I think maybe the kinetic thing is something.,1
"Industrial Designer: But may maybe we could go more directly, I do not know.",0
"Marketing: If it is made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there,",0
Industrial Designer: But the main point we talk about that with our manufacturer.,0
"Marketing: Yeah, but did we reach, with our style, the targeted audience?",1
"Industrial Designer: for the case, the supplement, the buttons, it really depends on the designer.",1
Industrial Designer: I must not forget my pen the next time.,0
Industrial Designer: It is just printing something on a board.,0
Project Manager: If you cover it with rubber.,0
"User Interface: So, there must be some cheap standard cover, maybe white or something,",1
"User Interface: One nice wee feature if we could if we could still do the rubber, I though of was to have the rubber extend beyond the end of the of the rigid substructure.",1
Project Manager: I think it is.,1
Project Manager: Think they are just called face plates?,0
Project Manager: Can you maybe fix the other.,0
"User Interface: So you do not use it that much, you do not have to see it all the time.",0
User Interface: Ah the logo should be on the top I think.,1
Project Manager: If I draw here It draws about four centimetres lower than.,0
Marketing: We have w definitely talking some type of.,0
Industrial Designer: components of a remote control.,1
Marketing: And I was sent a report that was I think there were a hundred remote users that they interviewed.,1
Industrial Designer: certain restrictions do apply here though.,0
Project Manager: but I do not know how useful it'd be for changing the channel.,0
"User Interface: So, it just depends what you think about these ideas, if I'm yeah, maybe, Kate, you better say what you think about them.",1
Project Manager: But that can be done later.,0
User Interface: Something like this.,0
"Project Manager: Now I have this the company is costing for various aspects of design, I have treated some of these slightly liberally given the constraints placed on us, I would not know for in for instance if they require us to have it in the corporate colours, then that is not a special colour, that is a that is a standard colour.",1
Project Manager: But it would be nice.,0
User Interface: And the rest is hard plastic.,1
User Interface: There are some spiders that live in like that have like kind of a big ball of a of a web.,0
"Industrial Designer: So then there is this other matter of the chips, well we could use a simple design on the board,",0
Project Manager: But that covers all the all the other settings.,0
User Interface: I dunno if we can use that.,1
"Project Manager: So I'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers, we speak about this tool we are going to design, try to make a project plan, some discussion, then we talk of the next meeting.",0
User Interface: But maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them be kind of down so you could feel them.,0
"Project Manager: Because if we do have enough space in our finance, I would say do integrate it,",1
User Interface: But there is already in a one done.,0
User Interface: Some kind of thing or it gives a b bleep sound or some kind of sound.,0
Industrial Designer: Yeah so it is a.,0
Industrial Designer: No no we will This is a preference but we can always change.,0
"Industrial Designer: It is not changing, no?",0
"User Interface: If you want to turn the ball, it is very it is very convenient for you to turn the ball to change the channel.",1
"Industrial Designer: Well, f four five buttons, it is sufficient.",1
"Project Manager: My favourite animal, which changes all the time,",1
User Interface: Well it is it is more I mean it is more ecofriendly than the than the cradle 'cause you are still using power off the grid with the cradle.,0
Project Manager: As to a the costs involved.,0
"Industrial Designer: We can think about TV with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones, you know.",1
"Industrial Designer: then we have it on the TV, the menu.",1
Industrial Designer: That is why we have that button.,0
"Project Manager: Yes, 'cause our market is international, your problem is has to do with marketing of you know, you gotta know how many we are going to be selling to know how big a market you have to target, who is that.",0
User Interface: A very good example is Google.,1
User Interface: it is just one colo yeah.,0
"Marketing: Questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven, from true to false,",1
"Marketing: No, I think we come up with a with a attractive marketable product, concept.",0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah we will yeah, so I will be able to summarize our meeting,",0
"Marketing: Yeah, I mean you are famous.",0
"Marketing: Most people'd be willing to pay for that most people want remote controls to be pretty, they want it to be fancy, th they want it to be different, everybody has a white remote control with black buttons, a red button, a green button, not everybody wants that.",1
"Industrial Designer: we can use rubber, plastic, wood or titani.",1
Industrial Designer: This can be discussed as well.,0
"Project Manager: When you push the button, the remote control gives a signal.",1
"Marketing: there is a there is an important thing that, you know, people use when, you know, when you are filling up your home, you know, a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap, basically, you know, you have got all this stuff, you are just like, what the hell is that, who is ever gonna use it? You know, so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both, so I think we need to aim for both.",1
"Marketing: There we are, that is me.",0
Marketing: Yeah this is the initial specifications.,0
User Interface: If it is enough line.,0
"Project Manager: I think all the special colour things have to be marked over here, because that is what we were planning to do, making it.",1
"User Interface: among the findings I found that m most of the curr presently available remote controls also include other functionalities in their design, like operating a VCR, but they do not seem to be able to deal with DVD players, but then there are surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them, but according to the last minute update actually we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design.",1
"User Interface: we have our we have the enter button, what was the other button here? This is the teletext.",1
Marketing: But we do not have any buttons.,0
Project Manager: and the white board worked really well without any pro.,0
Project Manager: I would say I mean it should be probably designed for a righthanded p person.,1
Industrial Designer: I see some action over there.,0
"Marketing: Maybe it is an idea to sell it without a cover, so that you can pick a cover in the in the shop.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, I s I suppose in a sense you could have if you have got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting rather than having to go one to a hundred, you could go one to one to ten, ten to twenty.",1
Project Manager: and it is kinda new.,0
"Project Manager: right, welcome to meeting B.",1
User Interface: I'd give it a three for this for that.,1
User Interface: You are the only one.,0
"User Interface: simple, plain, but I mean I do see what it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality,",1
"User Interface: And then, well this is on off button.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, but we decided to have something yellow, red, for the costs.",0
"Project Manager: And so if there is one element that requires the more expensive one, or say the regular one, or the more advanced, then that would have to be the same for all of them.",0
Marketing: but I think it is an interesting I think that maybe shows more about being open to technology.,0
"Marketing: So we have one button,",1
"Project Manager: we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about, it needs to be original, trendy, userfriendly.",1
"Marketing: So, now we have to come up with a decision.",1
Marketing: And we are a fashion forward technology company.,0
"Industrial Designer: well my personal preferences here, well we have to keep it simple.",1
Project Manager: I hope our Industrial Designer does this better because this is.,0
Marketing: we want something that people want in their home.,0
Industrial Designer: So hopefully that makes sense for everyone in my kind of garbled way.,0
"Marketing: If we are going to add a speech interface, I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog.",1
"User Interface: But you ca not you ca not use Bluetooth all the time, twenty four hours a day.",1
"Marketing: Was that does that mean to it, single curve?",0
Project Manager: See what was on the agenda.,0
"Marketing: Strangely enough it is more important to be fancy than to be wi, now that is the second thing it has to be, it has to be technologically i innovative,",1
"Project Manager: We were talking about it being more, a lot more tangible.",0
"Project Manager: Y maybe, two? We have two special colours.",1
"Marketing: I think I think the fact that, you know, ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes, I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control, does say quite a lot really.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, production cost is at twelve fifty, so.",0
Industrial Designer: And the company logo.,1
"User Interface: which should not be th that difficult to implement, like eighty to hundred word.",1
User Interface: I give it a four now.,0
"User Interface: And again, using bigger buttons, less number of buttons are also preferred, as I see.",1
"Project Manager: But let is try it, with the different the designs, the functional designs.",1
Marketing: I also have a preference for rubber.,1
User Interface: it is like you press this or this or.,0
Marketing: Then a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that an LCD screen in the remote control would be preferred.,0
"Project Manager: Energy source I think we have, I think we have decided batteries, although not exciting, are probably our best bet.",1
Marketing: I like the fact that on both of them the keys play such a prominent role.,1
Project Manager: Because the expensive parts are in either the advanced chip.,0
"Marketing: Ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more, it goes down from there, seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five, thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five, twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five, then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five.",1
Marketing: I do not know.,0
"User Interface: What about the buttons, would Would the buttons be wood too, or.",1
"Marketing: and then if someone wants to, you know, change the contrast on their TV, they should be able to do that, it should be accessible,",1
"Marketing: Yeah, i if it Yeah, if it costs gets too much, too expensive, then yeah, we should be sticking to rubber buttons.",1
Project Manager: And then we can we can use the time better.,0
Project Manager: So one for the quick zapping possibly one you know with just that rounded part that fits into your hand.,0
"User Interface: I dunno, what is the idea for.",0
Project Manager: I kind of think it is unique enough that I'd give it a one or a two.,1
"Marketing: I'm going to draw a butterfly, because I saw a butterfly yesterday, that seemed to be like the symbol of Spring arriving.",1
Industrial Designer: I also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for.,0
"Project Manager: But the current one, you'd say would be fancy, would be too.",0
"Industrial Designer: yeah, but i basically when I'm watching TV I'm just using like five buttons or so,",1
Project Manager: So I would also say this four.,0
Project Manager: That will it literally would just be a button.,0
"Marketing: One thing I did not say I think, is that a lot of users also said then I would buy a good looking remote control if there will be one.",1
"Project Manager: No the scroll wheel required the regular, so the.",1
Industrial Designer: I imagine that we could specify.,1
"Marketing: At the same time, it is important that it is easy to use.",1
Marketing: And how exactly does the kinetic energy work?,0
Marketing: It is easier to bit nice to handle.,0
"User Interface: What does double curved mean, I do not understand.",1
"Industrial Designer: So keep in mind that everything that you keep think of, it has to b to be built.",0
User Interface: scrollwheel is on the left side.,0
"Project Manager: now, it was function F eight.",1
Marketing: I think I think that will be too big tha too big then.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, plus if anything that is special forms makes it slightly easier to use.",0
"User Interface: Yeah, it was a pleasure working with you.",1
Project Manager: I'm not confident enough.,0
"Project Manager: I mean obviously everyone we are you know sounds like we are all a bit sort of gadget heads, we like things that do everything at once, but you know, that is.",0
Project Manager: And Not sure what they mean by supplements.,1
"Marketing: I had a first part of mine was to make a remote control for a new f remote control for television, afterward I had a discussion about coffee so.",1
"Marketing: Besides that, I think the market for forty plus is like pretty small.",1
Project Manager: And it seems you get more information by email.,1
"Project Manager: we will probably get questionnaire in a minute, it is a.",0
Project Manager: Does not make.,0
"Project Manager: But maybe when you scroll away, back it will be normal,",0
Project Manager: in my interpretation of management is instructions is that yes it meets the requirement.,0
"Project Manager: You are the one that is gotta go, find out do th do the research, see what people want in a remote, what buttons are used more often, s stuff like that.",1
"Industrial Designer: So these are people who are gadgety, right?",1
User Interface: There are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear.,1
"Marketing: F not many buttons, u useable buttons.",1
"Industrial Designer: I was just wondering about the, what, what Genevieve said before, about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing.",1
Industrial Designer: although I ca not see it on my screen.,0
Marketing: What ages are involved.,1
Marketing: That should be pretty nice colour.,0
"User Interface: Banana is yellow, yeah, definitely.",0
Project Manager: So it should be flashy or just more interesting.,1
Marketing: So on the on the top is better.,1
"User Interface: But I do not think when you are watching TV, hearing loud noises from the TV, someone screaming one, you f the channel switches, Yeah.",1
"User Interface: So we need some numbering buttons, some teletext things.",1
"Project Manager: I d I agree, I mean we are simply it is simply required to incorporate the corporate logo prominently.",0
Marketing: So we asked users what frustrates them the most about current remote controls.,0
Project Manager: Yeah it is below forty so we can decide where to.,0
Project Manager: first we have three steps of making the remote control.,0
"User Interface: No, I kne I knew.",0
Project Manager: and w when we to d for this one we have to make it more cheap.,1
Project Manager: and it might be too expensive.,0
"Marketing: Maybe we could think about how, could be more, you know, streamlined.",1
"Industrial Designer: well we have a single curve, which was maybe like the feel of the product is quite good.",1
"Project Manager: Do we take titanium smelling like fruit, or do we make spongy fruitylike.",1
Marketing: And we are all l going to list all the criterion.,0
"Industrial Designer: So well done with the management, I felt well managed.",1
Project Manager: for now this is this is.,0
"Industrial Designer: That is also short, catchy.",0
User Interface: But w like just normal light?,0
"Project Manager: this is the opening, then we will get I will hope we will get acquainted to each other.",1
Industrial Designer: So we cannot work on more than one page at same time.,1
User Interface: here here is just two pictures of remote controls.,0
Project Manager: I think you can turn it this way also.,0
"User Interface: And then we had just two buttons, we place them in the middle, the menu, for the teletext.",1
Marketing: And we put the fashion in electronics.,1
Project Manager: as you can see I mean that is taken up well over half of the price.,1
Project Manager: Problem comes here as you can see in the interface.,1
User Interface: And the kinetic energy part.,1
"User Interface: puts fashion into electronics, we should never forget about it.",0
Marketing: So spongy means y Yeah.,0
"Project Manager: So I might make this a two instead of a one, I guess.",1
Project Manager: so we are putting together a new remote control.,1
"Project Manager: So having this at twenty five Euros is quite attractive, I think.",0
Project Manager: And are they any special form?,0
"Industrial Designer: If we get an advanced chip which is used for the LCD, the display thing, then that is even more expensive.",1
"Industrial Designer: you need a user interface, which controls the chip, thus the messages, the user interface is that is basically just you kn the s sorta design of the actual remote which you hold in your hands, what buttons will be on it.",0
"Project Manager: Could be flat, you could insert your remote into it.",1
Marketing: But I thought it would be curved on two.,0
"Industrial Designer: when it comes to the chiponprint, as I said, the more advanced features you want, the fancier the chip has to be, the more expensive.",1
"Industrial Designer: Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours,",1
User Interface: Sorry can you just say that what is the what are our price goals again?,0
Industrial Designer: So you gotta decide which of those is more important to them.,1
Marketing: it was a report about an experiment with a lot of users.,0
Project Manager: of course we have not actually got a working model yet.,0
"Project Manager: We put the fashion in electronics,",0
Project Manager: here is the agenda for the meeting.,0
"Marketing: And there was something else, they kept track of the frequency per hour in using certain buttons.",1
"Marketing: Uhhuh, that was not very much.",1
Marketing: that is cool.,0
"Project Manager: I think we also have to go to our own rooms again, but well.",1
Industrial Designer: because it is really a team project with a team.,0
Industrial Designer: So I do not think it is that much of a problem.,0
Project Manager: and m maximise the profits.,0
"User Interface: well I think other than ge getting a sort of more aesthetically pleasing form for it, mo most of the sort of layout design decisions are are made, I would say.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah button shape might be a good idea to change, rather than rather than positioning,",0
"Project Manager: Cause I thought it was only men,",0
"Project Manager: Yes, I think just I just write a final report.",1
Industrial Designer: But all these things are usually inhouse so we do not have much problems.,0
User Interface: then I'd like to make a proposal.,1
Project Manager: it is only for televis.,0
"Marketing: you know, where you can use both hands, like a little keyboard type thing.",1
User Interface: Might be quite expensive to do that though.,1
"User Interface: well, there are l at least basic functions, like just th the channels one till nine, on, off switch, which must be clear with a red button or something like that.",1
"Industrial Designer: It can actually be flat or it can be curved, then the different types of materials that you can use, I do not think you can use them in a combination, but.",1
Industrial Designer: And we are having the speakers regular chip for control.,0
"Marketing: The target group has a weak spot for fruit, vegetables, like primary colours, spongy shape.",1
"Industrial Designer: so good news from me for me from Hamed, but bad news from Bob obviously, because spongy design, I do not like it as.",0
"Marketing: And how do you know? I mean, you got that email.",1
Project Manager: Maybe not even pointed.,1
Industrial Designer: So we will get to that later I guess.,0
"Project Manager: We have to look what the needs are, the effects of the functional design, how the the remote control works, so that is where we are going to look in the functional design, it is for the f next meeting.",1
User Interface: now my personal preferences.,1
"Project Manager: Well, every customer, they have their own ideas, they have their own test, so there is no end, there is no limit.",1
Project Manager: My name is Rose Lindgren.,1
User Interface: It is a scary cartoon dog.,0
Marketing: then forget about it.,1
"Project Manager: Electronic simple chip on print, we will need one of those.",1
"Project Manager: It sounds like the covers that they use for the remote, you know, your t your cell phone.",1
Marketing: I do not know if that is the correct word.,0
"Project Manager: 'Cause I mean we have all we all kind of agreed our product is satisfactory, it fits the budget, it is trendy.",1
Marketing: so this is just a presentation on the trends that we are gonna use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment.,0
"User Interface: But they want to talk into the remo remote control, or something,",1
"Industrial Designer: So I prefer kinetic because it is well, the costs are not that much higher, ju just a bit more hightech than a normal battery.",0
"Project Manager: So, do we have a hand dynamo? No.",0
"Marketing: Personally, I do not really think that I want one that is gonna go out of style or go stale, excuse the pun, in a year, so.",1
User Interface: then this this this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product.,1
"Marketing: but like so you'd just say remote five, you know, remote ten, remote one two nine.",1
"Marketing: And then ease of use was the third most important, whi so really, no matter what, we need to focus the most on fancy look, feel, according to this.",1
Project Manager: But that is not for me to decide.,0
Marketing: Then there are some onetime use function.,1
"Industrial Designer: Well, can we talk about something else?",0
"Industrial Designer: Maybe it can be yeah middle of like, between those two.",1
"Industrial Designer: It is not it is not quite a face plate, it is more like a pseudoface plate because it is simple enough.",0
"Industrial Designer: Now for buttons, normal requirements like bit coding, all those things are required.",0
"User Interface: basically the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance, in this case the television set.",1
"Industrial Designer: Have to think about the question, you know, 'cause it is I think that you know you can always you know.",0
"Marketing: I would say it is the Russian trick, but.",1
"Marketing: I was actually kind of upset you know at the budget, that we had to cut a lot of stuff.",1
"User Interface: we are probably gonna have to go with a like a medium chip, s I would imagine.",1
User Interface: You need a onoff switch I do not know how that got in there.,0
Industrial Designer: It should be.,1
Marketing: It is kind of like Eighties neonstyle.,0
Project Manager: You can look at it for s presentation.,0
"Industrial Designer: On the left a scroll button, on the right a scroll button.",0
User Interface: I made my own map.,0
User Interface: I found it as well.,0
"User Interface: So the scroll wheel, in or out?",1
"Project Manager: And like if the if the phone is under the couch, you might not see the light, so.",1
"Marketing: because I mean all the other remote controls on the market have infrared, so people do not expect anything other than infrared.",1
"Industrial Designer: Like with your keychain, if you whistle it goes it makes a sound.",1
"Marketing: And w when you want to use the parents option, you have to.",0
Industrial Designer: Yeah we need one integrated button for everything then.,1
"User Interface: Alright, so from when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting, we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape, the material that we chose was wood, the colour would be customisable, 'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour.",1
"Industrial Designer: So, are there any more cycles in this process? I think not.",0
"Project Manager: so anyway, yeah, this is what we are gonna do afterwards, just lunch break, have more individual work after that, so let is see what we let is see we So you have to come up with a components concept, yeah.",1
"Industrial Designer: it does actually you know affect how, w whether you feel comfortable to communicate.",1
Project Manager: It does not work any more.,0
"Marketing: Ah, but in my instructions I think it said I was supposed to go to the board, do something.",0
Project Manager: First we have to make a functional design.,1
Marketing: So it might be helpful if we had a look at that.,0
"Industrial Designer: because we could produce, you know how cellphones have those overlays that you can change the colour.",1
Project Manager: I think we have to keep the LCD.,1
"Industrial Designer: I would not think so, 'cause we could probably get it from like, in bulk, from a newer company.",0
Marketing: With these new costings.,1
"User Interface: And you have to put in a number, so it works on your TV.",1
"Marketing: which I think given the target group is what you would expect, really.",0
User Interface: and I have just got an email from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in.,0
Project Manager: And as usual you will receive some specific instructions on.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, of course.",0
Marketing: And I'd prefer the corners to be round.,1
Marketing: I kinda I like the potato look.,1
"Marketing: with the current remote controls, the universal ones, you have to press yeah, you have to press a code for TV.",1
"Marketing: I think if we had a locating device with the small one, I think that seems way more advanced.",1
Project Manager: But that will be all worked out in other meetings.,0
"Project Manager: that is Kate, for the working design.",1
"Project Manager: But, really teamwork were you two.",0
"User Interface: It is been a little bit difficult to make sure that it is handholdable, that the user can use it, you know, it is not too big.",0
Industrial Designer: because I think it is.,0
Project Manager: I will be able to not answer them.,0
Marketing: I mean remote controls can be thin bits.,0
"Marketing: One thing I would want to see is is can we can we get a lifetime guarantee on this product, a normal use guarantee, which means that this product, for the for the life of the life use, if it should have a technical problem, that we could re replace it at no cost? That was something I would be interested in.",1
Industrial Designer: And these are three different types of or two different types three different types of shapes you can have.,1
"User Interface: And yeah, the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n more functionalities, the answer was already no because of the last minute update.",1
"User Interface: Now this is a special, special feature which we have included.",0
Industrial Designer: It was a little confusion about my.,0
"Marketing: This is twice as important as the next finding, which is technologically innovative.",1
User Interface: And which you do not use.,0
"Project Manager: we well, we use the same file during the whole day, you can make new sheets by by pu puttin pressing on the blank button.",0
"Industrial Designer: Well, make it available in different colours, you mean?",1
"Marketing: Right, so that will be it.",0
Project Manager: we have been writing this up for m months.,0
"Industrial Designer: I think, it would not be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device, maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote.",1
"User Interface: though you i it would be necessary to have have a m have a ha have a mode for programming it without the computer, just in case there are there are still people left out there who do not have them yet.",0
"Project Manager: Or you know, a b a b a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button, then a side an s up, down type of thing, like on like on a DVD player.",1
"Project Manager: Well you could argue you might do it once a year, you would change,",1
"Project Manager: one concern with the rubber casing is that it would be rubber encapsulating all of these chips, diodes, delicate technology as.",0
"Industrial Designer: So, more research into that one.",1
Industrial Designer: and to reflect about it.,0
Project Manager: And it is not too complex to do it.,0
"Project Manager: yeah, not the b the watch kind.",0
"Industrial Designer: I think it is easier to use than a regular remote control, because when you push on the options menu, you get the various options entirely explained.",1
Marketing: And the third one is easy to use.,1
"Project Manager: We have to close this to finish this meeting, so.",0
"Project Manager: Well maybe there should be a separate button apart from the LCD,",1
Industrial Designer: Maybe our personal coach will have something to say about that.,0
User Interface: So if we can have a higher priced remote control I think that would really be worth something that would be worth implementing.,0
User Interface: And we are actua actually making a better profit than we expected.,0
"Industrial Designer: So you are right we can see in our R, D if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy.",0
"User Interface: as what it, the major findings market researchers have said, it is the image, the appearance that people di dislike.",1
Project Manager: You do not see it at the ears?,0
Marketing: That does not fit in with the whole vegetable theme though.,0
"Marketing: And, yeah that they have lots of personality, be fit, in robust good health.",0
"Marketing: This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification, prototype design that meets the criteria that we got from our market research.",0
"Project Manager: So that if that was in the voice recognition, that would be great.",1
"Project Manager: So twenty five Euro you expect a quite, well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control.",1
Industrial Designer: Not in depth.,1
"Marketing: They are never gonna come back, buy it.",0
"Industrial Designer: So we need to have some energy source to do what to do the functions, what we want on this portable device.",1
"User Interface: We are forgetting about that now, but.",1
User Interface: I'm just gonna go through the interface concept with yous now.,1
"Industrial Designer: With a scroll menu, a w scroll thing, a LCD.",1
"Project Manager: Trendy design, compact, strong.",0
"Project Manager: Like as of yet, that has nothing to do with, the way it will look.",0
"Project Manager: But, do w gonna gonna are we going to give it a twotone colour look, like the plastic mould is in one colour, the s the cushion pads around it are in another colour? Is that the idea? Is that a good idea?",0
Project Manager: but that is good.,0
User Interface: Well I will draw what I had drawn on the screen.,0
"User Interface: At the side, or something like that.",0
"Project Manager: That is true, but that is what we stick under the menu button.",1
"Project Manager: In that moment it has a sensor, i it gets a certain darkness, it ge has a sensor, it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep,",0
"Project Manager: you each have individual actions, I ID Industrial Design you have your components concept, User Interface, the user interface concept, market trend wa watching.",1
"Project Manager: That is just for the case material,",0
"User Interface: So, if we are trying to keep costs down, then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go.",1
"Project Manager: Is it better? When you the menu, you have to go there.",0
"User Interface: But the thing that I find most interesting about this remote control, it is kind of difficult to to see in the slide, but it has a scroll wheel on it, which is kind of like a mouse scroll wheel, which I think is it is a really kind of important design aspect is it is 'Cause the thing is what a what we the presen this presentation we had is what we want the remote control to actually do.",1
"Marketing: So I dunno if there is something that diff, you know like five different face plates.",1
"Project Manager: under marketing we targeted our audience, yeah.",1
Industrial Designer: Twelve point three five.,1
"Marketing: Well you can see here, our target group would not do that.",1
Project Manager: you need a smart board application I think.,0
Project Manager: and the next big thing is the finance.,1
"Marketing: I had one of those, my brother, my dad, could have beat me up.",1
"Marketing: like question, is remote big enough, we can say it is true or it is false by steps.",0
Marketing: Instead of the current functional lookandfeel.,0
Industrial Designer: I dunno where she.,0
Project Manager: Well apparently now I write the final report.,1
"Project Manager: Yeah, that was a bit mean to put it in the end.",1
Project Manager: Do you have more to your presentation?,0
"User Interface: Fewer buttons, simpler to use, if ten percent is hidden away if ten percent is what is used, maybe the other fifty percent, the buttons that are used very rarely like programming, they could be hidden maybe under some remote controls you might have come across have maybe a little flip thi thing where they are hidden away.",1
Industrial Designer: No 'cause it is samples sens sample speaker.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yes, that is really possible.",0
Industrial Designer: So I will say two.,1
Project Manager: It is very promising.,0
Project Manager: So s four?,0
Industrial Designer: And we seem to have least something in each criteria.,0
"Project Manager: first is the functional design, this is where we all go off, do our individual work, what needs need to be fulfilled by the product, what effects the product has to have, how it is actually going to do that.",1
"User Interface: So using some LCDs we can touch, so we can remove keys, just having, I dunno the name, LCD responding to fingers.",1
User Interface: So we should make it too complex.,0
"User Interface: Because all the TV sets will be digital, right.",1
"Project Manager: Then we will take the decision on the remote control needed functions, then I will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting.",0
"Marketing: you do not normally have a car,",0
"User Interface: They want something that looks nice, that is not gonna break when they drop it, that you know that maybe it is ergonomic, it feels good in your hand, something like that.",1
"Marketing: I do not know, I mean I guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable.",1
Industrial Designer: But then we come to the costs.,1
"Project Manager: bright funky designs inspired by fruit, keeping with the hip kind of feel.",1
Project Manager: But then again you do not want you know like the first mobile phone that was this big.,0
"Industrial Designer: that dif batteries right, Batteries go weak as well, so after a while you have to point it towards the towards the equipment you wanna control with it, right? So, have to m show which is the front, which is the back.",0
"Project Manager: And plus these two, f plus the mute button, it is will be eighteen.",1
Project Manager: so now we are on the conceptual design meeting.,1
Project Manager: First a little about the project aim.,1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, I think an LCD screen might be good in theory, but not as useful in practice.",1
"User Interface: This is our remote control, with the flip panel as you can see.",1
Industrial Designer: it is chos So that should be hard plastic.,1
Industrial Designer: But I think that that collides with our mission to make it very cheap.,0
User Interface: So I think all three groups will need to interact quite a bit.,1
"Project Manager: It is an uni an unique feature,",0
"Industrial Designer: I'm Manuel, I'm the Industrial Designer in this project.",0
"Marketing: but I feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming, use the board well, this would have been six months' worth of work, not like three hours' worth of meetings.",1
Project Manager: I think it would be simpler.,1
Marketing: And that is on the camera.,0
"Project Manager: and who we all are, stuff like that, get bit more of an idea together of what is going on.",0
User Interface: we just chose simple shapes for all them.,1
Project Manager: for many reasons.,0
Industrial Designer: That happened to me all the time though.,0
"User Interface: there is an a athe aesthetic value, but not functionality.",1
"Marketing: Then And the second thing, some companies they think that they should have more, more functions of the users or in their remote controls, but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want, what they operate, rather than making it too complicated.",1
Marketing: It is gotta be lowcost or highcost with special design features.,0
"Industrial Designer: Well y you have also the language problem,",0
"Marketing: Actually had a cable between it, the TV.",0
Project Manager: so we have this at the moment.,0
Marketing: Sometimes they play a movie.,0
Industrial Designer: Do you want to present it?,0
"User Interface: Yeah, like up, down, left, right.",0
"Project Manager: But you have to fill in this column, huh?",0
"User Interface: So if you lift up the panel, you can see the lovely yellow LCD display.",1
Industrial Designer: Deadlines were sometimes very short.,0
Marketing: And you need a you need a speaker.,0
Marketing: is that appropriate? You are saying the triple A batteries are small or the surrounding it?,0
"Marketing: And we do not w I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical,",1
User Interface: So remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station.,1
Industrial Designer: there is also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things.,0
"Project Manager: we have new project requirements, we are not going to be using teletext,",1
Industrial Designer: and that is the back of the interface.,0
"User Interface: And then changeable fonts, so.",1
"User Interface: But th Yeah, that can be very simple.",1
Project Manager: I will for industrial design.,1
User Interface: Though it would have been nice to be able to transfer the transfer our n our paper notes onto the computer ourselves.,0
"User Interface: Or just leave it? could make an a volume button scroll, volume button.",0
"User Interface: Because So it works like good morning remote control, then the remote control says good morning.",0
"Project Manager: but only the I think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control, it makes it a lot easier as well.",1
User Interface: So you'd have to have like.,0
"Project Manager: Although I think we yeah, but we could still make a remote control that ap applies more to young people by giving it another colour already.",1
Industrial Designer: And three D curved is also in depth.,1
"User Interface: So we need to know all the different you know all the different signals, so that will require some memory as well.",0
User Interface: No rubber buttons or something.,1
"Industrial Designer: and basically it can have a flat surface, a curved surface or a double curved surface, but I think if we wanna use standard components, we are gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that.",1
Industrial Designer: But you might as well do it in normal computer style.,1
"Industrial Designer: In fact, I will give it some more.",0
"Project Manager: one thing that we have almost not talked about at all, my apologies for that, user interface, we also need to maybe get the slogan in here, it is,",1
"Project Manager: we want to know to at the end to know the new project is requirement so we need to know the user needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the from the technical part we want to know how it going to work, third part I do not remember.",0
"Marketing: and if it is was not edible then Well, normal babies.",0
"User Interface: When you saw th li Earlier when we selected it, w I could not erase anything.",0
"Project Manager: well see you all in about thirty minutes, then.",1
"Industrial Designer: This one is, I suppose for the younger audiences.",1
Project Manager: Put it in there wire on it.,0
Industrial Designer: but the prices I read are high.,0
Industrial Designer: so that gives us a more trendy look as well.,0
"Marketing: But you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom, tells you what is on.",0
"Project Manager: So And after that we have to make decisions, what we will do.",1
"User Interface: Well, I do not ha really have much to add, because most of things we already said in the previous discussion.",0
"User Interface: with a m yeah, w if we dis, when we s discussed that we might like this flipping open thing, then I mean y you can use it as a normal remote control,",1
"Project Manager: Is the project evaluated? We are all happy that it meets all the criteria,",0
"Marketing: Yes, further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is, it is gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who is sixty.",1
"Project Manager: We could just have the logo in yellow,",1
Marketing: In the middle.,1
"Project Manager: General project, what is i in For example, I thou I thought we were pretty creative in what we created.",1
"Industrial Designer: Well the thing is, if it was had an alarm system,",0
Industrial Designer: There are a few buttons connected.,0
"User Interface: But if you are programming the colour of the TV, do not display twenty other options that are possible.",0
"Marketing: So what I have, wh where I have got my information from is a survey where the usability lab observed remote control use with a hundred subjects, then they gave them a questionnaire.",1
"Marketing: And again these are all things we have kind of already come up with on our own, but this just backs it up.",1
Industrial Designer: But do not we wanna make the background the bright colo colours? So th the total of the thing is very bright?,0
"Marketing: When we did f fashions, recent fashion our recent fashion update shows that.",0
"User Interface: Not that we actually know anything about it,",1
"User Interface: Would you be able to, put the little device anywhere? 'Cause is not our remote control for all TVs, so.",1
Marketing: You have to you have to Because some fat people with d thick fingers will press three buttons at same time.,1
"Marketing: Yeah, but then you have to choose the always with r universal remotes you have to choose the code.",1
"Project Manager: further yes we must think, do we stay to television only, the television as we as we all know it with broadcasting signals, you ca not go back h, or do we go further as Matthew indicated by supporting recording devices?",1
"Marketing: There were six true or ones, four pardon me, two s almost true or close to true, so that was four points, then one false, seven points, so seventeen divided by nine we are between one, two.",1
Industrial Designer: 'Cause if it is just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of a mobile phone.,0
Project Manager: I will go back to my own presentation.,0
"Industrial Designer: I also think that th f the feel of it is, when you hold it, is something that was expressed more in my design.",1
"Project Manager: We decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it, because we have international appeal, we said it is for all age groups, different functions of it.",1
"Project Manager: so another important part of the project is about money, about so about finances.",1
"Project Manager: It is more true than false, about a two.",1
Marketing: current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user.,0
Marketing: The second most important aspect is that a remote sh that the remote control should be technologically innovative.,0
Industrial Designer: With the articulators.,0
"Marketing: And neither did the older generation, but the younger generation who we are catering for, like who have most of the money nowadays, do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote.",1
Marketing: considering the little amount of input we had going in.,1
User Interface: So the s a button less.,0
Industrial Designer: So you are more likely to b.,0
"User Interface: a regular chip, which is like the medium porridge the medium expense.",1
Industrial Designer: another thing I think we d missed out on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design.,0
Industrial Designer: This would actually show the circuit diagram.,1
"Industrial Designer: And that would probably, I d, well what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design.",1
"User Interface: The bu the mute button to switch the volume on, o on, off.",1
User Interface: Well it is kinda both of us.,0
"Marketing: Now I think it'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all TVs, you know you s you click a button, it finds the frequency that works with your particular television.",1
User Interface: Because it it is not it is not it is not difficult.,0
"Project Manager: Pretty much kept to the company strategy, so I would go for a a one, as we not only kept it, but we were limited by.",1
"Marketing: I do not know whether it is one of those things that like sort of having all fruit shaped keys, that probably would go out of fashion very quickly,",0
"Project Manager: Well a worry that was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would e it would effect how long how long it took us to get this to market, so I th suspect it might be a good idea just to restrict our kind of our creative influence on this on the user interface, not worry so much about how we transmit it.",0
Marketing: Some things that I drew from this are that I think we were correct.,1
Marketing: Then we did some research to the most relevant functions.,1
"Project Manager: speech recognition potentially, flat screen interface, LCD interface we also want to limit the nber of buttons so we will pretty much take that one as read.",1
"Project Manager: Just give five with them, just in a box.",1
"Industrial Designer: which yeah would have all of all of the available functions for the remote on it, whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons, like the vo volume up, down, channel up, down, power on, off, things to that effect.",0
Marketing: And we can make special features.,0
Industrial Designer: There is a user interface here.,1
"Project Manager: Anyway, we will take this project in three steps, three pha three phase of design.",0
Marketing: We only actually needed one computer.,1
"User Interface: But is our research about bi large LCD sh display, or just a small one we want to use?",0
Industrial Designer: The one at the top.,0
Industrial Designer: It is not a microphone.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, you can also do that, but maybe.",0
Marketing: I mean working remotes we already have.,1
Marketing: That is my dic that is my presentation.,0
Industrial Designer: For a TV the most important feature which I felt was the locator which is a cool feature.,1
Industrial Designer: could put it at one or two I would say.,0
"User Interface: And use friendly, yeah.",0
"User Interface: I dunno if you should take that in consideration, or that you just should aim for the normal TVs.",0
Project Manager: There are a few but in general not.,0
Project Manager: So you are User Interface guy.,1
"User Interface: but they both say V on them,",1
Project Manager: Use pen format.,1
"Project Manager: But it can be battery consuming, no? To have the light always on?",0
Industrial Designer: I dunno what you were talking about but.,0
User Interface: I do not know.,0
"Industrial Designer: so push buttons for the traditional users so that they do not feel they are alienated, just a scroll button with push technology for channel selection, volume control, teletext browsing.",0
Project Manager: did we decide on a chip? Let is go with a simple chip?,0
Marketing: But I do not think that is really an issue any more 'cause Well might be.,0
User Interface: And everyone is gonna be satisfied.,0
Marketing: Yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five.,1
"User Interface: And were there any factors that were not important in the survey, that they said we do not want?",0
Marketing: then the methodology I adopted to find out all this was market survey.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah I know, but if I wanna go to say number like sixty five, channel sixty five, if I press the six it will go to channel six, then I will press the plus, then it will go to six, then put the five, it will go to sixty five?",1
"Project Manager: Few buttons, we talked about that.",1
"Project Manager: but what, what are other tef technical things we have to discuss?",0
Marketing: We already discussed that.,1
"Project Manager: But wha th our basic idea y I mean, you gonna we are probably gonna have like two type of materials, like the d b the plastic enclosure, then the pads that surround it.",1
Industrial Designer: It is not just straight.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, the they are big, clear.",0
User Interface: it but you actually got to write on the paper.,1
"Industrial Designer: and it is quite conventional, sometimes people do not like too much flashy colours like this one presented here.",0
"User Interface: and, I think that has given a proven ease of use, what not.",0
Industrial Designer: Plastic covered with rubber.,1
"Industrial Designer: Although customisation, because this is being done, you know, the on onorder basis, it might be the quantity wo not m wo not.",1
Industrial Designer: and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the TV.,1
Project Manager: Any other immediate thoughts before we move along?,0
"Project Manager: the only thing we have to look after is that we use different colours, different line width.",0
"Marketing: So you can say, you can.",0
"Project Manager: Well, this is the agenda for today.",1
"Marketing: Well that is an idea of course, yeah.",0
"User Interface: Not not yellow, but just a bit of light yellow.",0
"Marketing: Lose a little bit on the fashion, yeah, but.",1
"Industrial Designer: Well I think that is a very interesting idea, but I'm not a very good industrial designer, I do not know much about what these things cost.",0
"Project Manager: It was very productive day,",0
"User Interface: Well, I kinda think if we are gonna have the voice recognition for part of it, then maybe we should have it for the whole thing.",1
Project Manager: You have another meeting soon?,0
User Interface: Whereas I think the aim is to take away buttons.,1
"Marketing: PlayDoh wo not last very long everybody will go like, oops, it is gone.",0
"Industrial Designer: We'd also have to wor consider that who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes, we might wanna learn about labour laws.",0
"User Interface: personally wa what I want from a remote control is a device that is simple, it it is easy to use, it is got big buttons for doing the things I do most often, changing the volume, changing the channel.",1
"Project Manager: It is good to visualise everything, but I think the response time should could be a lot better.",0
Industrial Designer: So that is one the those are the choices we have to make.,0
Marketing: and then you can use it again.,0
"Industrial Designer: When the recharger has a has a bit what points out, we can place all on top of it.",1
"Industrial Designer: But we are thinking that, seeing as we are having it in interchangeable casing anyway, that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use.",1
"User Interface: so I did some research on the internet, what you know, the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users, commands, mechanisms for the operation, there are just kind of a variety of choices.",0
"Project Manager: first we going over the minutes of the last meeting, more or less.",1
"User Interface: Just the look like, the button part I will explain.",0
Marketing: but selling price is is that wholesale or retail? Like on the shelf.,0
"Industrial Designer: And when you push the button, it will will be sent to the chip.",1
"Project Manager: and we can make it yellow, that is pretty much banana like.",1
"Industrial Designer: Or you know you lose it, it lies behind the couch for a week.",0
Industrial Designer: Say it for the camera.,0
Project Manager: So that is something we can discuss as well.,0
User Interface: You have to decide.,0
"Marketing: y you lose the banana, you press a button, you hear like monkey screams or something like that to direct you towards the banana.",1
"Marketing: Technologically it should be like work, basically, I guess.",0
"User Interface: Are we still you say we are focusing on TV, but is it still a kind of like a universal remote in that it is a replacement remote control, or is this something for our own line of televisions?",0
"User Interface: At the same time, it is m more like it would be more interesting for people who are having this RSI, all problem.",1
"Marketing: And by making it multipurpose, it has a new feature, adds a new feature to the market, distinguish from from current products.",1
"User Interface: Yeah, that is a possibility,",0
Project Manager: I would say a two.,1
"User Interface: Then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep, 'cause that will feed into both Ed is work, Christine is work.",1
"Marketing: so if we add approximately two to three Euro per remote, now we are up around about twelve, twelve, a half as to what the company had initially requested.",1
"Project Manager: yeah I like that I like the idea of putting the logo in the boot up screen, nice.",1
"Industrial Designer: I think people who are maybe about I would not say thirty five,",0
User Interface: I have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect.,1
"Marketing: The younger market likes Well, the themes of this year are surprisingly fruits, vegetables, spongy material.",0
Project Manager: And then you can Yeah.,0
Project Manager: So we can discuss these points.,1
User Interface: I hope that is not too much.,0
"Industrial Designer: personal preferences, I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal, the company simply ca not afford this kinds of lawsuits.",1
User Interface: Instead of a stick.,1
User Interface: So we are under the budget.,1
Industrial Designer: Because infrared is not visible.,0
"User Interface: Yeah 'cause we wanna incorporate a bit of colour if we can, once we find out.",1
"Project Manager: No hand dynamo, right?",1
"User Interface: But I think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design, po possibly within maybe the budget that we do it, because you'd need to know all the spef specifications of a all the like electronic companies.",1
User Interface: what is the function? Yeah f for loading up the batteries.,0
Industrial Designer: I think so too.,1
"Marketing: And this would, could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep.",1
Project Manager: Yes of course it will be a we get a if it works we can get aftersales.,0
Marketing: I would give that a three.,1
Project Manager: S Any other questions or comments to be discuss?,0
Project Manager: We need the advanced chip.,1
"Project Manager: other things were we were hoping to use rubber, most likely gonna be double curved, etcetera.",1
User Interface: That th there is no display there.,1
"Industrial Designer: The case le that is what I wrote first of all, could be plastic our plastic.",1
"Marketing: One two three four five, si.",0
Project Manager: If you leave out the LC display.,1
"Project Manager: Well, welcome to the kickoff meeting.",1
"Project Manager: we have got the functional design, conceptual design, detailed design which basically is the three of you.",0
"Industrial Designer: I would not have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first, in like on the way to channel sixty five.",1
"Industrial Designer: we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet, so or something like that.",1
User Interface: We need to start by considering what a remote control actually is.,0
"User Interface: But you know we can we can discuss this, but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general, but done well.",1
Project Manager: And our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty.,1
"Marketing: So you can pick up, use it, than I think.",1
Marketing: furthermore the learning time is a problem.,0
"Marketing: then like a locator, so you know, kind of like you have for a mobile phone or.",1
Project Manager: Aquaintance is a point we have done a bit.,0
User Interface: I think possibly it might be more useful if Kate went next.,1
Industrial Designer: Under documents in the shared folder.,1
"Project Manager: I think you can email me, if there is any more questions.",1
"Project Manager: or maybe, you are my coordinator, am I right?",1
"Project Manager: Functional is not an issue, then easy to use.",1
"User Interface: And I thought the button for teletext apar apart because it is not really options, I think.",0
"Industrial Designer: I did get a bit more done than the last time,",0
Project Manager: So we that means we need a button on th on the on the basis.,1
Industrial Designer: People'd be real upset.,0
"User Interface: We could assign any button a command to any button, if we have enough processing power,",1
"Industrial Designer: So th I think this is just like gonna be the a very outer case, which we will decide on rubber.",0
"User Interface: A pi There is that box in the TV, so with the set box you can connect internet with your TV.",0
"Project Manager: It was a management decision,",1
"Industrial Designer: So, if finally the TV breaks, you get a new one, you are gonna have to be able to tune it.",1
"Marketing: Between the age of fifteen, twenty five, most people would be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software.",1
"Marketing: No, do totally.",0
Project Manager: because your finger is on top.,0
Industrial Designer: That is possible too.,1
"Project Manager: if you need any coordination in between compared to the maybe the some technical vendors or commercial vendors, depends if you want to have some marketing plan or technical plan, so you let me know.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah th yeah, the chip is the regular one.",1
Marketing: Would that imply video use?,0
"Project Manager: No, it was up there, but I could not see it down here.",0
"Marketing: Besides, you have four sides to a thing, so I mean does curved one side mean one side is straight.",1
"Industrial Designer: Well, the smartboard, the d drawing is just a pain in the ass, but The digital the digital pen is very nice.",1
"Marketing: I will tell something about the way this this test was, yeah, done.",0
Project Manager: so it is not quite But well I have to do it.,0
Marketing: I think so.,0
"Marketing: Yeah, I mean that is the thing is that it did not say in the survey, you know, whether, you know, these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control,",1
"Marketing: No, we have t we have to change the end cost.",1
"Project Manager: chip on print, case.",1
"Project Manager: means, whiteboard, digital pens, etcetera, what does that mean? Any ideas?",0
"Marketing: Put one option, then you have the all the buttons of that options, so the other options would be gone.",0
"User Interface: you can you can l let choose the customer which colour he wants, yeah.",0
"Marketing: so I suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price, we d or is it going to make our product look a cheapiecheapie option?",0
Industrial Designer: And then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition.,1
"User Interface: ID, UID work together on prototype drawing on smart board.",0
"Marketing: twenty five Euros, I think we can make it.",1
User Interface: Or combine both with a with one.,0
"Industrial Designer: cause we wanna appeal to the to the young public with fancy with flashy colours, with a lot of shape.",1
Project Manager: And what is the sample sensor slash sample speaker?,0
"Project Manager: So, it has to be soft?",0
Marketing: It would cost more than plastic.,0
Industrial Designer: Yeah well inside the remote control we use a couple of.,0
Project Manager: So it could be grey on the banana one.,1
Industrial Designer: And this one is producing normal light.,0
Marketing: It does look very cool.,1
"Marketing: But it all has to do with the budget, because it is not the bad idea we had, so.",1
Project Manager: nontechnically challenged people are gonna use it.,0
Project Manager: I used to have a remote that did not even go up past like fifty.,0
User Interface: Then I got a popups to go to the meeting.,1
Project Manager: So Well what costs a lot? The sample spea costs four.,0
Project Manager: That would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a foldout bay for more advanced functions for users.,1
"Industrial Designer: the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed, 'cause sometimes solar power fails, there is no way round that, we should install a small backup battery.",1
"Marketing: Seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly,",1
User Interface: Th then we still have too much.,0
"Marketing: You have got market range international, you did say earlier it is got to be a accessible, usable by sort of all age groups.",0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah now we can still talk about the material,",1
"User Interface: for the inside, rubber as a padding or for the grip, something like to add to the design.",0
Project Manager: Well it is i there is other things too there is you just ca not place it.,0
Industrial Designer: Yeah but I but it is impossible to to accommodate accommodate all the buttons on the s on the difference different televisions sets on one remote control.,0
Marketing: That is Yeah.,0
"User Interface: there is a problem that I have got couple of preferences for the end control I get 'em with the red colour button for standby, s the other examples of that The buttons should be large.",1
"Industrial Designer: and then tell them, we had to drop this, that, just that you know.",1
"Project Manager: We shou we could also, that was a would also be an idea, but I do not think it I do not know if it exists already, you should like make Alessi or something design it.",1
Marketing: So Now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale.,1
"Project Manager: Yes, the voice recognition we already decided.",1
User Interface: Colourful? That is not practical.,0
Marketing: Ah now I remember what is RSI .,0
"Project Manager: So, last question, will I change my rem change my remote control from Mando banana.",1
"Marketing: That is for incorporates current fashion trends, is easy to locate.",1
"Project Manager: It is That mean we should use the colour of our company, maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company, which is, we put fashion of in electronics.",1
Marketing: And the feel of the material is expected to be spongey.,1
"Project Manager: I would think is i is probably, you know, no more than minutes in its entire life.",1
Project Manager: And we had a special colour.,1
"User Interface: Yeah, so capsicum or pepper.",1
"Project Manager: do we have any ideas of maybe d let is just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have, then we can go into how we are gonna design it, how we are gonna do the detailing on it.",0
Marketing: And the digital the digital pens.,0
Industrial Designer: Maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then.,1
"Industrial Designer: I will give it a two, because at the moment it is not looking that way.",1
"Project Manager: changing the case would not be so much of a mmmm, nor would changing the case materials.",1
Project Manager: Ryan is our User Interface Designer.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, from the previous group.",0
"Marketing: about the screen, speech recognition, some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that.",1
"Project Manager: That'd be, that'd be good if we were going with our ball.",0
"User Interface: Where I think the largest portion of the market is just gonna you know they lost their TV remote, they need another one that will work with their TV.",1
Marketing: I will give it a two.,1
Project Manager: There is a good man.,0
Project Manager: First you can save the documents.,1
"User Interface: Yeah, if we make it into a four, as in neutral, because we did not implement it, so we ca not say that we that it is really not well implemented.",0
"Project Manager: Yeah, so what we will do is, we will stick with the simple design for time being until th Ed find outs about the how much it is cost to the extra, in case we go for the display.",1
"Marketing: a dynamo is ah, it is a bicycle.",1
"Marketing: That is the selling point, the thing that is gonna make it an impulse purchase.",0
"Marketing: so design preferences, we need easy to read like large buttons, clearly labelled so that, I mean 'cause we talked about that being a problem.",0
Project Manager: Were there room for was there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings?,0
"Industrial Designer: First one, we can use simple battery, or we can use traditional solar cells or the material we can have plastic, rubber which is good for this RSA.",1
"Project Manager: the remote control should only be used for the television, otherwise the project becomes more complex, which endangers the time to market, of course would make it more costly, I think.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, that gives you a younger, more hightech look, I f I figured.",1
"Marketing: And I think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger,",1
"Industrial Designer: But if you are a regular TV user, you just want to watch the Dutch television networks, well, you can you can use about ten buttons.",0
"Project Manager: It becomes a very dull remote control, I know.",1
User Interface: So let is carry on with this.,0
"Project Manager: But it is probably, I would say, probably not worth the investment at this point in time.",1
User Interface: a small speaker you mean.,1
"User Interface: What I feel is, customers never said anything about the battery.",1
"User Interface: but the problem is whether people need it, whether they do have a TV to use its full.",1
Industrial Designer: Well that does not bo bode well for it for it tats as well.,0
Industrial Designer: Perhaps we should make clear to our customer that we had to do this to stay under the cost.,0
"Marketing: Titanium, the really strong metal, titanium?",0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah because the batteries, those thingies last forever.",1
"Marketing: in my second sheet of personal preferences, we have to reconsider the speech function recognition.",1
Industrial Designer: I think I will just check it.,0
"Marketing: Has that not made any d if you click off that square now, has that not made any difference?",0
Project Manager: And setting buttons hidden in.,0
"Industrial Designer: Well, maybe it is good to do it anyway, because if we evaluate it, we can also determine if our objectives are good.",1
Project Manager: just take what I'm going to draw is an elephant.,0
User Interface: you have if you press them for a long time No.,0
"Project Manager: Because it is just some extra information,",0
Marketing: I think we have done very well to get within budget.,0
Industrial Designer: This energy source of course is connected to the user interface itself.,1
"Marketing: According to the frequency of use versus importance investigation, following buttons are most important.",1
"Project Manager: Do we go for maybe a remote contro sorry, we are gonna go for a remote control obviously, do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels, up, down, then, what, another button that would say that it is now being used to manoeuvre round the LCD.",1
Project Manager: well we have point three to get rid of somewhere.,0
"Project Manager: they have also suggested that we we only use the remote control to control the television, not the VCR, DVD or anything else.",1
"Marketing: say that we have a seven point scale, from one to seven,",1
"User Interface: Yeah I like that one, but that one is terrible.",0
User Interface: We could promote the banana one.,0
"User Interface: To be honest, we have the capa we have the design inhouse,",1
User Interface: And the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line.,1
"Industrial Designer: this is just off the top of my head keep in mind, but I think the voice recognition would they are both they are both gonna push the costs up, but, since we already have the technology inhouse for the voice recognition.",1
"Marketing: yeah, that is true.",0
Project Manager: You can you can change markets where by changing the front covers.,1
"Industrial Designer: I really appreciated those, yeah.",1
User Interface: So all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle.,1
"Industrial Designer: i it is just four buttons that are on a cross,",0
User Interface: I have a little problems with my laptop.,1
"Marketing: But it is only a plastic thing, r really, the thing on the wall.",0
Industrial Designer: depending on what the chip tells the infrared lan lamp.,0
Project Manager: That brings us to the chip.,1
"Project Manager: I'm not sure, if you can put some research into that, if it is possible.",1
"User Interface: It could be quite a good brand, like a good little object.",1
"Industrial Designer: if you mi one of one of my requirements was about needs t to tell you when it is done its job or not, because half the time, I keep pushing on the remote control, I do not know if it is actually understood my message, so I think it should give you some sort of an oral cue.",1
"Project Manager: You know, they have bit of expendable income to spend on this sort of thing.",0
"Marketing: 'Cause a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use, that was thirty four percent but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it is lost somewhere in the room.",1
Industrial Designer: And I used possibilities from our manufacturing department about current components which will have to be implemented in the design.,0
"Industrial Designer: O of course the more technology you stick in that, the more it will cost, so.",1
"User Interface: It is for, like, the ultimately lazy people,",1
"Project Manager: It is gotta scroll, push.",0
"Project Manager: Yeah, but do you think it will be easy to use?",1
Project Manager: Well this still is very bad.,0
"Industrial Designer: And then the sender, which is usually, I have found, an infrared device which sends a signal to the actual television.",1
"Project Manager: so you have had to meet with the marketing team, how they are going to market, what are the marketing strategic plan, when are you going to introduce, by the time you introduce the product, you know there would be a competition, so I need some kind of the plan in the writing from you.",1
Industrial Designer: So it means design should be similar to the traditional ones?,0
User Interface: Do they make batteries that last that long?,0
User Interface: I do not know how much that is going to.,0
"Marketing: They also say, that is about I thought it was fifty per cent, that more money will be spent on better looking controls.",1
"Marketing: It is definitely channel, volume, power.",0
"Project Manager: maybe how this can be achieved, we need the user requirements from the manag Marketing Expert.",1
Industrial Designer: It probably means this is probably double curved.,1
Project Manager: What are y What are your first ideas for the new product? What.,0
Industrial Designer: Especially for that kind of money.,1
"Project Manager: you know you get a lot of remote controls where you kind of flip the thing open,",1
Project Manager: You have a mute remote controller.,1
Project Manager: the agenda for now are there any prediscussion questions?,0
"Marketing: And definitely if it could have less buttons, still maybe the same nber of functions, but less buttons,",1
"Project Manager: The case material is gonna be soft, rubbery, changeable.",1
"Project Manager: but as the expert told us, most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels.",1
"Project Manager: think that might appeal I'm thinking kind of Japan, I'm thinking young, office people,",1
Project Manager: For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it.,1
"Marketing: I thought mo maybe we could make a clap system, so when you clap your hands it will beep or something.",1
Industrial Designer: Can you explain what you want us to write there?,0
"Marketing: Well th, the young, trendy, they they starting to like fruit, vegetables as a theme for n clothes, shoes, also products.",0
Marketing: We all have to keep in mind what has changed now.,1
"User Interface: Where is the remote control? We have all had it once, I want to watch some television,",0
Marketing: I'm not sure if this is legal.,1
Project Manager: Exactly so we have margin for that stuff.,0
Marketing: I wish I'd had my camera.,0
Marketing: But some of you had something to read about speech recognition.,0
Marketing: so question number two was is it techn technologically innovative? So I know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative.,0
"Industrial Designer: and w how much it is cost, maybe with a f cheap chip.",1
Project Manager: I do not think it is very expensive.,0
"Marketing: s functions that may be used by u the user in the current available remote controls, well the tables look very nice to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you use it only once per session, but it is very relevant.",1
"Industrial Designer: And where we had a few buttons, all.",0
"Industrial Designer: it might work for volume, maybe some of the brightness controls, stuff like that,",0
"Marketing: but with the little flipup, if you have a little display on the flipup that when you close it everything is locked.",1
"Project Manager: Then they can show you how it looks like, then we can submit to the I will submit to the management.? Then meantime you can come up with the price, how much it is cost as extra for the display.",1
"Project Manager: then we do some in individual work, then we have a meeting to discuss the results, etcetera.",1
"Industrial Designer: Well, I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling, by these kinds of sticks or something like that.",1
"User Interface: so you ca not have the televisions, information back to the remote control, at least I do not think you can.",0
"User Interface: And the numbers, that should be a bit larger I think it is not really on scale, so forth.",1
Marketing: It is cus spongy also.,1
"Project Manager: Yes but I can I think I think we can just use more cheap plastic for a kind of basic edition, then people can fancy it up with more expensive materials.",0
"Project Manager: then, you know, f for the next meeting Kate will be looking at the s the look, feel, design, Kendra the w the user actually uses it, Andrew of course the product evaluation.",0
"Project Manager: And our idea is to to make the new remote control device more user friendly than the previous one, to to be trendier, to be with it, therefore to to get a bigger market share, bigger audience.",1
"Project Manager: Sorry, I'm just trying to update my minutes.",0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, this is a LED too.",0
Project Manager: Then it is c then we are yeah.,0
User Interface: And here are is here is a s short summary that I summary that I compiled after the findings I found.,0
Marketing: My favourite animal is like A beagle.,1
Marketing: You pass it round to have a look.,1
"Industrial Designer: so we need some custom design parts, other parts we will just use standard.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, seven inch T TFT screen, which is good news for us, since we wanted to include a display there.",1
"User Interface: I thought we'd lunch right now, or not?",0
"Industrial Designer: titani is not gonna be possible, even though it just it beyond our budget really.",1
Industrial Designer: but in this case it will only be TVs.,0
Industrial Designer: The green one is a circuit board.,0
"Industrial Designer: and I will give you the, I guess, technical considerations for those.",1
Project Manager: so you are participant two?,0
"Marketing: And first off we should state that th the remote control is for controlling the TV, how do people use it? We asked them sort of which buttons were useful for them.",0
Industrial Designer: I mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours I think it would look quite fancy.,1
"Marketing: Yeah, you can put that on the two eight four, six or whatever.",0
"Project Manager: I'm Heather, I'm your Project Manager.",1
Marketing: And of course I did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon.,1
"Project Manager: we'd like to, to, make fifty million Euro.",1
"Marketing: We have the lightning, or.",1
Industrial Designer: The user interface.,1
"Industrial Designer: so I agree on using any kind of LCD, less buttons good for me as a as a designer of the circuit.",0
User Interface: No it is it is.,0
Industrial Designer: Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing? And then just put also on LCD on it?,0
"Marketing: for me personally it is everything fine, it may be having good design, it may be meeting all the requirements of the customers like technologywise, pricewise, but there is one thing which limits the customers, like we are having only two, three designs, like we are having one banana design, the other one is orange,",1
Project Manager: Because we do not implement a user history.,0
"Industrial Designer: The email I got said simple chip, but when we put in the speaker, the retriever device, it will cost a bit more, like I think the advanced chip maybe.",1
"Project Manager: I do not know, we have to ask these question.",1
Project Manager: so I guess now we just go to the project evaluation which I will allow Sarah to take over.,0
"Marketing: Three? well I say still two, but it has to be three then.",1
"Marketing: It is Yeah, so No it is one.",0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, that is what I was thinking.",0
User Interface: Or we have to delete this one or.,0
User Interface: So that is our concept.,0
"Project Manager: And, your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen.",1
Marketing: Material technologically innovative.,1
"Project Manager: So we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense, that were decision makers.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, I was thinking that as well, I think the only ones that I have seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things where they are,",0
User Interface: Having a little bit.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, I do I do not know that.",0
User Interface: who is giving who is giving who is giving our budget.,0
"Industrial Designer: it seems to make sense that we we'd just maybe stick with the standard rubber case,",1
"Project Manager: the buttons, what it does, that sort of thing.",1
Project Manager: Her personal favourite was it should be Tshaped.,0
Marketing: And seventy five percent of the users said they zap a lot.,1
"Marketing: Yeah, for the LCD.",1
Project Manager: What is the feelings of the group on the kinetic?,0
"Industrial Designer: and also with I do not know how to use PowerPoint, so it takes me forever to get something done with it.",1
Project Manager: You you gave it a four.,0
"Project Manager: but will there Like the first idea from You can buy it without, with parental contr control? Or are we going to put it in, just.",0
"Marketing: It was the I'm here thing,",0
"Industrial Designer: I just did s see that we were starting a new project together, there was going to be a four member team composed of these people, that is about that is.",0
User Interface: Scrolling through your favourites list.,1
Industrial Designer: It would be like going a step back in time.,0
Project Manager: So like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever.,1
User Interface: But the but the buttons have their own LEDs or not?,0
"User Interface: That? Right, technical functions design.",1
"Project Manager: or for it working, it just being good, reasonablepriced, solid.",1
Industrial Designer: Well this is really your decision but.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, that is true.",1
"User Interface: Seven is good, yeah, is not it? I ca not True or false? No sorry tr one is true.",1
"User Interface: I think it is, but I do not know what you think.",1
"Project Manager: If we could choose more than one, that would be my second choice.",1
"Industrial Designer: Special form also, it says.",0
"Project Manager: the case, what does it mean by single, double, do you know?",0
"User Interface: It is just got the essential functions of the TV changing the channel, play, stop, volume.",1
Project Manager: Well that is also design.,0
"Industrial Designer: I do not have any details to, when it comes to the cost but it will be a significant difference.",0
Industrial Designer: But you are the expert.,0
Project Manager: That is nice.,0
"Project Manager: So, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,",0
Project Manager: I see what.,0
"Marketing: The round shapes, soft material m materials like the rubber.",1
"Project Manager: No I think with our new radio button, I think it is I think it is better.",1
"Industrial Designer: I think, making it out of a nice material would be very important, because so many of those remotes that you see, these universal remotes look so cheap, low quality.",1
"Marketing: No, not n not too much focus, not too much focu not n not too s not too similar to a fruit because next year the ten the trend the trend will be different.",1
"Marketing: Yeah, that is right.",0
Marketing: And then some internet research.,1
Marketing: Voice activation might not be the best.,1
"User Interface: No we do, but it is not filled in.",1
"Marketing: We are here to design, come up with a nice product.",1
"Project Manager: So I think it would be a good idea to keep the curve to separate it from the rest of the remote control world, so to speak.",0
Marketing: It is not a vampire bat honestly.,0
Project Manager: when he is not here we will just we just have to continue.,1
Project Manager: Well we have a power button.,1
"User Interface: Just make through a remote as it is, but make an option to insert profiles,",1
"Industrial Designer: We need a power source, we are gonna need a smart chip if we are gonna make it multifunctional.",1
"Project Manager: So, I will open our functional design meeting.",1
Project Manager: so we only do this when we have enough money left.,1
Project Manager: Do you need to change anything on it? Because otherwise I will already open it.,0
Industrial Designer: and how It is an interesting concept to see to have voice control.,0
Project Manager: Rubber buttons require rubber case.,1
"Project Manager: So, with their all their useless requirements.",1
"Project Manager: So, now that we know how to use the whiteboard,",1
"Project Manager: So basically, even if you had a silver the same colour of silver on your display, because you have got effectively a double edging on the on the logo, it means that it splits off what your logo is from the from the product.",1
"Project Manager: huh? So it is curved, it is still that so we dropped the speech recognition together with the speaker.",1
"Marketing: but Yeah, we have we have the zoom option, right?",0
Project Manager: given speech recognition I think w you should go for the less fancy chip.,1
"Marketing: Or is it do you think it should be only voice recognition, gesture recognition? Or you still have the possibility to use buttons?",0
"Industrial Designer: And maybe it is also then thoughtful if we u use as different kind of shapes for the for remote control, that we then use the primary colours.",1
Industrial Designer: We have to make one design I th I think.,0
Project Manager: cause it is the top part that is.,0
"Industrial Designer: We have it, we design later where everything goes.",1
"User Interface: Well what I s propose is that you know a remote controller, i it could be a cube,",1
Marketing: So when you buy your remote you can buy.,0
Project Manager: No kinetic also.,1
User Interface: Well you are.,0
"User Interface: So then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range,",1
"Industrial Designer: anyway it is a it is something that can be used to fulfil a function, but at end of the day we do not look at the technology, but we look at the function first.",1
"Project Manager: It is not as fast as you w you know it, but it does work sometimes.",1
Marketing: Well it could just be simple instead of being a l mass.,0
Project Manager: Is not it bitter like that?,0
"Industrial Designer: Nah, but they just said we need it.",0
"Project Manager: Well, one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we are gonna be who is our target audience, our target market.",1
"Project Manager: we want it to hold up to somebody is child, you know, throwing it across the room or, as you said, people kinda throw it, so ballshaped, you know, if it were ballshaped maybe,",1
"Marketing: It the it might be perceived as tacky, glowinthedark.",1
"Industrial Designer: Anyway, we are not using really advanced technology, LCD has already been ruled out, ASR has been ruled out.",1
"Industrial Designer: whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way, it tends to get moved accidentally.",1
User Interface: I mean next channel.,1
User Interface: you wanna integrate everything into one like.,0
"Industrial Designer: Y Yes, I think so too.",1
"Marketing: So, one or two do you think?",0
"User Interface: but then again, the the menu structure to a considerable extent that is gonna vary according to the model of television, also any customisations that the user might wish to incorporate.",0
Industrial Designer: W why is the double curved two of them?,0
"Marketing: there was so much interaction, so much that we needed to bounce off each other.",1
User Interface: We have also included a button which is called as the swapping button.,1
User Interface: red it is is more attractive.,0
"Project Manager: I mean you have it for the portable phone, so why not yeah.",0
Project Manager: So we are just managing it really.,0
"Marketing: I do not I do not see it, to me if I'm gonna market a product for b for beauty for design I'm gonna I'm gonna try to market it at a much higher price.",0
"Project Manager: But we have to keep an eye that it is at the beginning of such a project, it is very cool to talk about, well, this would be cool, that would be cool.",1
Project Manager: We might possibly have done.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, we really like we really like that design,",1
"Industrial Designer: Eh, for th the vocal command yes, it is might be easy.",1
"User Interface: is a small device that looks like a cube, maybe you can just change the the buttons, if you ch turn one side you get one buttons, you turn the other side you get the other buttons, so for maybe new generation people who get used to the computer they want lots of controls.",1
User Interface: but nobody giving much idea to this.,0
Marketing: It is in the project documents.,0
Industrial Designer: but you ca not see an alarm inside the alarm system itself.,0
Project Manager: Of the of the process.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, that would cover it.",0
"Marketing: I mean we have done some research about sort of you know what the cutting edge sort of hand held devices are, a lot of them sort of use you know they are like they are like mini laptops.",0
"Industrial Designer: And the chipset, it says simple here, but it should be advanced, because we are using an LCD screen.",1
"Industrial Designer: when I put it in, is going to beep.",0
"Project Manager: Yes, I do not mind to convince the management,",0
"Marketing: And a teletext, but that is not of the question.",1
"Project Manager: We should bring new technologies for young peoples, as we have also requirements to use to push thr toward the internet.",1
Industrial Designer: The big chunky remotes are died in the eighties.,1
Marketing: We have to discuss about that.,1
"Project Manager: Yeah, that is it.",0
"Project Manager: Yeah, but then you do not have t yeah it that is not something i that is in the production cost a one it is a one time, you know s was it is a single cost.",0
Project Manager: Maybe waterproof would be very original.,1
"Project Manager: For example, a little TV guide.",1
User Interface: I think one in b bright colours would be good.,1
"User Interface: Well, there is sometimes combinations, I mean, like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power.",1
User Interface: And I think we should lose the curve.,1
"Marketing: Well, if I look at what is the most expensive things, it is the LCD.",1
"Project Manager: The scrollwheel, I mean.",0
User Interface: So here are options for our power sources.,1
"Project Manager: getting the external power source, that is quite true.",0
User Interface: so these are all options that the user interface guy can has at his disposal to put together a user interface.,0
"Project Manager: that is also good with the fashion, everything,",0
"Industrial Designer: the subcomponent, I suppose that you understand what a subcomponent is, is f in this example it is the button.",1
"Project Manager: but it is something to think about, yeah.",0
Marketing: see what the market consists of.,0
Project Manager: But maybe we have to Yeah.,0
Marketing: So what do we do.,0
Marketing: But there is not really any other options unless it is like a keyboard.,0
Marketing: that the layout of the remote controls did not match they way that they used it.,0
Project Manager: So First of all the functional design objectives.,0
Marketing: Yeah ind of structure into layers.,0
"User Interface: If you have some presentation, you have some f.",0
Industrial Designer: And then you get to the circuit.,0
"User Interface: For TV, you are always in the neighbourhood of a TV, so I do not think the range should be a problem to that,",0
Project Manager: It th this is whole concept.,0
Project Manager: I think we still have to fit in one more questionnaire.,1
"Industrial Designer: So it is a speech synthesis kind of thing,",0
"Industrial Designer: and it is also much more likely to not work if we add these bells, whistles.",0
"Project Manager: Well, w as long as we know that issue is.",0
Industrial Designer: If it drops to the floor then it starts to scream.,0
"Marketing: so yeah I was thinking something easy to use, especially for older people.",1
"Project Manager: No, I keep the re Yeah.",0
Marketing: finger grips just on top of the plastic?,0
User Interface: Yeah you can you can embed it microphone here.,0
Project Manager: But it is for the next team.,0
"Marketing: What is hot, fruit, veg.",0
Project Manager: Well do you want colour differentiation here?,0
"User Interface: But in the present scenario is that you have certain keys, you press it like your mobile phone, it sends a message to the TV.",0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah alright, yeah.",0
Marketing: How do I hook my screen up?,0
"Marketing: Because when you have the LCD onto the television screen you miss the picture in the background, we are most focused on the commands.",1
"Industrial Designer: Now I have all about circuits, chips, transponders, I wrote it all down, because I thought it would be relevant, like all the different parts of the inside of a remote control, but then they are like, you do not actually need this you just need to talk about the case.",1
"Marketing: and it is a bit weird at first, but it is actually very like fast.",0
User Interface: You have to use your imagination a little bit.,0
Industrial Designer: So that is all about the buttons.,0
User Interface: so I would actually give it a three.,1
"Marketing: Well, if you save Perhaps s tiny buttons are not userfriendly, then we would not im implement that of course.",0
"Marketing: But as far as production I'm putting up a question because we are talking about profit also, in mine you will see the problem with our survey, the p the possibility that how many units can be sold, what percentage of the market, etcetera because that has to be taken in into consideration.",1
"Project Manager: Just kind of young professionals, th like if we are going to include speech recognition, it is kind of between fifteen, thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that.",1
Marketing: We have to make it grey or s or black.,1
"Marketing: Yeah, let is give it a six.",0
"Project Manager: that is Yeah, go ahead.",0
Project Manager: Yeah I know I d it seems like it would suffice to have just the RR on there.,1
"User Interface: what is my opinion about what is most important to combine the design, technical possibilities, the user friendliness in one, so if you going to design a remote that looks good, that should not weigh over the if it is possible to make, of course, but also the user friendliness, so tha that is some of the main points.",1
Industrial Designer: The use of the laptops for receiving everything.,1
"Project Manager: Well, so we have got one special button form, which was the apple.",1
User Interface: Yeah well iPod is trendy.,1
"Project Manager: Well it is looks fancy, especially with the green colour.",1
Project Manager: That has a lot of that has a lot of appeal but I think I'm talking about the functionality now on it whether we are looking at different groups.,0
"Industrial Designer: So if you want the spongy feel, you need to make these buttons all of rubber.",1
"Industrial Designer: Somebody else has go to use this room,",0
Project Manager: that is my name.,0
"Project Manager: About the project itself, not about the product.",1
Project Manager: then we have fifteen point eight Euros.,1
User Interface: To the thumb yeah.,0
"Industrial Designer: And when a button gets pressed, its goes to the chip.",1
"Marketing: So, we give it seven, we write.",0
User Interface: So I mean there are I.,0
Industrial Designer: it is obviously an a sort of clamshell design.,0
Project Manager: How much time do we ha we have left? M more than thirty minutes?,0
User Interface: Could drop the speech recognition.,1
Marketing: The remote control has m remova removable from Multilux.,1
User Interface: S definitely an option technically.,1
"Project Manager: the the UID, the ID were asked to go ahead, start developing a prototype for us to look at.",0
"Industrial Designer: You can have your own designs, you can feel simple designs.",0
"Industrial Designer: and the LCD, the scroll are inside.",0
"Industrial Designer: Think we just need to come up with a nice black, red interface on the touch screen.",0
Project Manager: I would have to agree on that.,0
Industrial Designer: So it wo not be too expensive to build it.,0
"Marketing: Yeah, I think I have.",0
"Project Manager: These are not very much, but, see you have to do it real slow.",1
"Industrial Designer: I think if you look at most controls, they have got more buttons than this.",1
Marketing: That does not say we got we can leave ninety percent off.,0
"Marketing: Well like, maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm pilots.",0
Project Manager: and then they got these little pyramidal type of speakers.,0
"Industrial Designer: Are we seeing as that was the most popular thing that came up out of your market research, I thi I think we should keep to that rather than moving to animals or something, because even if that may not seem obvious to us, if that is what the surveys brought out, I think that we should probably go along with that.",1
"Project Manager: So hav having seven buttons, instead of twelve.",1
User Interface: Maybe sorta spherical or something.,1
"Project Manager: So our target group is You mentioned older people? Would it just be universal for everyone, you think?",1
Marketing: Having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always.,1
"Industrial Designer: too much metal is used sometimes, people pick up radio signals, the like, there is also the possibility of the remote catching on fire, injuring the customer, just think of those lawsuits, that'd be really bad.",1
"Marketing: I did not miss, I saw that the fruit, there are many fr pictures of fruits, vegetables in the clothes.",0
"Project Manager: Eight, eight point two.",1
Marketing: The the product or the project?,0
Industrial Designer: That is the thing.,0
"Industrial Designer: I was computing all the all the things related to the speech recognition, it is to use just two batteries, solar cells, so.",0
"User Interface: The onoff, sound onoff, sound higher or lower, the nbers, zero to nine.",1
Industrial Designer: And dunno know why but looks like nice to me.,0
"Project Manager: Black is probably the normal colour you'd say,",0
"Project Manager: 'cause well, the designs are very bright, so you are right, they are gonna stick out, but.",1
Marketing: So welcome to the marketing presentation once again.,1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, s speech is a important extra feature I think.",0
User Interface: y yeah so we can have a s like you know moulded according to your.,0
"User Interface: I think that, if we are gonna put in more technology, that you need to be able to switch it open.",1
Project Manager: So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place.,1
Industrial Designer: And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals.,1
"Industrial Designer: which obviously it looks better than the single curve, but you ca not have it in titanium, which is a nice material.",1
"Marketing: No, that is n It is not relevant.",0
Industrial Designer: Yeah kinda like that yeah.,0
User Interface: And you can straight away see there is less buttons.,0
Industrial Designer: So it is b should be regular the second.,0
"Industrial Designer: But that is of course a bit more expensive than the basic calculator design, with the scrolling text, that kind of thing.",0
User Interface: We need to find that out.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, but does it fit with our design?",0
"Marketing: so we have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.",1
"Marketing: and if we think that what we are w our nber one marketing motive is the look, feel.",0
"Industrial Designer: The firm supplies a simple, a regular, an advanced circuit board.",1
"Marketing: Y you saw it in my marketing report, they like the new fancy stuff,",1
"User Interface: Like I have got one at home that has well, apart from the obvious, channels, channel up, channel down, volume,",1
"Industrial Designer: Well, the kinetic thing, yeah.",1
User Interface: That sort of thing.,0
"Marketing: So, on a scale of one to seven, one being true, seven being false.",1
"Industrial Designer: We are talking something more complicated of course, it is going to be more expensive as well.",1
"User Interface: Now as an interface designer, I would give more emphasis on the interface, how the remote looks like so that it is sellable, it is attractive to customers.",1
"Industrial Designer: Sh Yeah I was thinking one means no points, you know, all the way up to the top.",0
"Project Manager: No, this is very sophisticated technology.",0
Marketing: but they are used.,0
"Marketing: Yeah, I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal normal project without laptops without these devices.",0
Industrial Designer: that power source is important because it ties you down to how long the device will last.,0
"Project Manager: So I think we can take that option, just with with the idea in the back of our head that you can customise your remote control.",0
"Project Manager: But as it is now, I w would say, six, something.",1
Industrial Designer: 'Cause it has only one button.,1
"Project Manager: Maybe you, but we do not know much about production cost, but when you you can imagine that when you spend twenty five Euros on a remote control, it is a basic remote control, then the then the money there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know, rechargeable units.",1
"User Interface: W we will have a screen with a back light which can change colours,",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, draw it on the board.",0
"Project Manager: Because, if they do all the time the same gesture, as you said previously in the last meeting, maybe they will get injuries because of that?",1
Industrial Designer: Yeah of course of course.,0
"User Interface: You cou You could draw on it, but not as main function.",0
Marketing: in the same colour as the side.,1
Project Manager: First I wanna hear from you.,1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, it was a little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it.",1
"Industrial Designer: Well, there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them.",1
Industrial Designer: Is there a schedule for this meeting?,1
"User Interface: E the unique style, maybe have it light up so it is visible in the dark, the changeable faceplates, the lighting up, visible I was when we were talking about havi losing it, maybe to have a button on the television that you press, it maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that, so it is easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that.",1
"Marketing: I think if you can have the base station with a with a locator, I think those are two very strong features,",1
"Project Manager: At the end of the day, the company wants to make at least the fifty million Euro.",1
User Interface: Did not receive it.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, but just not on the top, but on the side of it.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, I think so, yeah.",0
"Industrial Designer: the rubber case requires rubber buttons, so if we definitely want plastic buttons, we should not have a rubber case.",1
"Project Manager: Just to let you know we will probably be quite tight for time as well,",0
Marketing: maybe you ca you can look at that.,0
"Project Manager: No, we ca not make a docking station anyway.",0
Marketing: It is a necessary evil.,0
"User Interface: Maybe I think i industrial design is, it is the function design.",0
"Project Manager: But well as you saw that had not made no sense, because we had to drop it.",1
Project Manager: w wait a sec wait a se.,0
"Project Manager: I dunno, I'm feeling like a big boy.",0
"Project Manager: After that we have to make a conceptual design, then after that a detailed design.",1
"Marketing: It s it saves us four Euros, it costs us two, a half.",0
Project Manager: But does it make any difference for the energy you use? You got still one LED.,0
"User Interface: But you also have to d start watching out for the weight, 'cause depending on how much the flip screen will add to the weight of the remote control, you do not want it to start getting too heavy.",1
Project Manager: Otherwise it is just saying I'm the secretary.,0
"Marketing: So we should take into we should consider this factor as the most important factor, because this factor is twice as important, the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as the third factor.",0
"Marketing: then if v we do have them illuminate upon contact, they could illuminate yellow.",1
Project Manager: Yeah so maybe you can hide them or something.,1
"Marketing: I give me a lower price, give me a higher price, give me some new technology, do not give me the same thing that everybody else is putting out there on the shelf it is f at the same price.",1
Industrial Designer: Th then you will see it on the television.,0
"Project Manager: Cause that is something to consider, I guess, if we are if we are using more advanced technology, it might increase the price.",1
User Interface: But as for actually arranging them let me go back to the to the picture of the kiddie one.,1
"Marketing: If we have a menu, how do we choose other options?",1
"Industrial Designer: so w what you see here is so this is the outside of the remote, right? If you open it, you have a circuit board here, right,",1
"Project Manager: The Industrial Designer is going to work on the working design, components design, a bit of the look, feel design.",1
User Interface: See if it is there.,0
"Industrial Designer: So But you could have a whole new the back the depth, you could you could just play around a bit with.",0
"Industrial Designer: scary, strong, yeah that is about it I think.",0
"Project Manager: yeah, well like a cat, you know, soft yeah.",0
"Industrial Designer: And it flips open on the side, so it opens like that.",1
"User Interface: We, we also have to keep in mind when we are designing our, more userfriendly remote control, that a lot of interfaces consist of a clutter of buttons, that, that their functions, colours, forms are not always helpful.",1
Marketing: People are only using ten per cent of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote.,1
"User Interface: so what I had been thinking was something chunky, yellow, plastic with black buttons with a logo on it.",0
Industrial Designer: So it has voice control.,0
Project Manager: But I think we will find out more about cost afterwards.,0
Marketing: And we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires.,1
"Industrial Designer: We can use plastic, which is very slippery, maybe not so nice, but you can give it any colour, which is the same for rubber, but it is not slippery.",1
"Industrial Designer: So the working design, I have got a very quick presentation on this, so I have no, you ca not see a thing.",0
Project Manager: Well you two created that wonderful specimen of a PlayDoh model.,1
"User Interface: Well smart board would be very nice to work with, if it worked really well.",1
Marketing: Well the first point is the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user.,1
Project Manager: So I will need to hook up the PowerPoint again.,0
"Marketing: well this is Yeah but this is here the question was, would you prefer it.",1
"Project Manager: But do we want the curved design,",0
Industrial Designer: Well put it there.,0
Marketing: We would have to look carefully into the design though.,1
Project Manager: In the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser.,1
"Project Manager: Like a phone yeah, like the backlight in a phone.",1
User Interface: For personal preferences I think that to make a babyproof remote control it got to be a titanium.,0
"Marketing: Here, think about removable covers, as seen in mobile telephon telephone market.",1
"User Interface: Actually that ca not be right, can it? well, no, they might see yeah, they might see this pointing down, think right that is gonna turn the volume down,",1
Marketing: What I found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device.,1
Industrial Designer: Pop pop up the champagne.,0
Marketing: The average is a two.,1
User Interface: So we have to make it s more It has to be.,0
Marketing: And eyecatching is important.,1
Industrial Designer: It is a good idea.,0
Industrial Designer: So th an ASR decoder we can have things in.,0
"User Interface: Having just listened to what Corinne just said, I will draw on some of the things as well.",1
"Industrial Designer: In th, but that rules out a universal remote control.",0
Marketing: Yeah but what if you lose your clickon device?,0
"Marketing: Maybe they are un they are in a little area but covered up,",0
"User Interface: I dunno if they are maybe a little bit more, but.",0
Project Manager: which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well.,0
"Marketing: Yeah just push it in for th for three seconds or something, then.",0
"Project Manager: So we have the project team, which is to basically to come up with a new r remote control device.",1
"User Interface: The o the o the other dis design constraint I think we should bear in mind is that people are you know very much used to using a remote control one handedly, so we need to make sure that e even with the joystick, you know something that can just sit comfortably in the palm of the hand, have the joystick just controlled by the thb.",1
"Industrial Designer: So it is half of the selling price, if I am good in mathematics.",0
"Marketing: And thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control, remote control.",1
Industrial Designer: It is rather hard to draw on the whiteboard.,0
Project Manager: I guess you two are on plasticine duty or whatever.,1
Marketing: the shape of a banana is not it is not really handy.,0
"Marketing: and if I'm coming in with a with twentyfive Euros, which is midmarket price, then what am I going to give these people for this?",1
"Industrial Designer: What the first thing question I asked was what are we trying to design? Well, a device which basically just sends the signal to the TV to change its state, whether that be the power, or the channel or the vole, everything is just some sort of signal to change the state of the TV or other appliance that it is sending the signal to.",1
Project Manager: Just a normal battery.,1
Industrial Designer: They are cheaper.,0
Project Manager: any questions at this point? Or suggestions?,0
"User Interface: Yeah, the voice recognition, we can use that ca not we, just to find it.",1
"Project Manager: if we wanna choose for wood or the black, grey.",0
"User Interface: No, you can you can just And then not a straight line but some sort of wave or something.",0
"Project Manager: Where is my mouse? Then We have got a general idea of the concepts, the materials we are going to use.",0
"Marketing: You know the other thing I thought about was you know, do we go to something like this? Make a remote that does not look like a remote.",1
"Marketing: About you said one, the television turns on one.",0
"Project Manager: even if it is a physical, you know, a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote, even something like that, then yes,",1
"Industrial Designer: The case, the options that I have gotten from headquarters about what we can do, there is the shape of a case, we could do a flat sh a flat case, a curved case or maybe even a double doublecurved case.",1
"Marketing: The if we are gonna do this touch pad screen thing, it would be still, do we know if that is an option technically right now to that?",1
Marketing: I between the round of the R.,1
"Marketing: they, you know, seventy five percent of the people we did the experiments on, found that rem remote the remote controls that they'd used in the past were ugly.",1
Industrial Designer: latex is tricky.,0
Industrial Designer: you need some power source.,1
Industrial Designer: so buttons definitely in but shall we try to draw a prec.,0
"Marketing: I think that goes against the whole fancy something, a new line,",1
Industrial Designer: it does not consume much power.,1
"Project Manager: well, it is simply filling no, it is it is also filling out no, I'd do it after lunch I think.",0
"Marketing: With the LCD screen it is easier because you only have to wipe the screen to for fingerprint,",1
Project Manager: Is there anything have I forgotten anything?,0
Industrial Designer: the cost of that is very high.,0
Project Manager: The b we will sell the t at twenty five Euros.,1
"Project Manager: Yeah well in fact we use a little bit the white board, the digital pen, not that much.",1
"Industrial Designer: you know, well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees, some nice woods.",0
"Industrial Designer: the user interface, the buttons, I guess we talked about this already.",0
"User Interface: When a users using a remote control, he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places.",1
"Industrial Designer: So we we will put some extras, if there is something.",1
Industrial Designer: This you so did you.,0
User Interface: And other buttons can may be displayed here if that is necessary.,0
"User Interface: but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway,",1
User Interface: but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black.,1
"Project Manager: No? Sebast nee, Roo? Roo, do you have any other.",0
"Project Manager: Just to do research into both, w what it costs, what it takes for space.",1
"Industrial Designer: There was a step about drawing something in the in the board, I do not know.",1
"User Interface: but it should be th I think normal batteries,",1
"Marketing: fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons,",1
Project Manager: But that is the end of our meeting.,0
"User Interface: No, this is the third slide.",0
Industrial Designer: And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote.,1
Industrial Designer: So maybe we should think about wood finish.,0
User Interface: Is it gonna work?,0
Marketing: and then others that are concealed.,1
"Project Manager: Or an isolated magnet or something like, or you know something that would not interfere I do not know that'd be the technical thing.",0
User Interface: It is a very good point.,0
User Interface: But I do not see anything.,0
Project Manager: Yeah everybody is got a mobile phone right? Except for me now.,0
"Industrial Designer: Not embed Yeah, but then with something like a touch screen could could make more menu up pop up or something.",1
Project Manager: the next meeting will be in thirty minutes.,0
Industrial Designer: that is me.,0
User Interface: And less functions would have to be included.,1
Project Manager: Yeah 'cause then ha you would have to who all.,0
User Interface: When it has an LCD screen.,1
Project Manager: and we'd have to have some room for future such channels.,0
"Industrial Designer: well, I would th think that depends on how much money you give us.",1
"Marketing: Well, this is my report, which is going to be based pretty much on a survey that I was sent.",1
User Interface: that is It changes things.,0
User Interface: if you have got small hands.,0
Project Manager: So we will get back th on that.,1
Marketing: Yeah three quarter of the of the.,0
"Industrial Designer: so I will list things, then we can come back, discuss what we think from everybody is perspective.",0
"User Interface: it is easy to press the other the big buttons, but, it is not that difficult to press the channel buttons either.",0
Marketing: I was just gonna say mayb maybe it sh like maybe we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost.,1
"Project Manager: h, because we have to have a design, that is within the budget.",1
"Marketing: yeah, did we achieve that.",1
Marketing: But VCRs Yeah.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, I think we are I mean before we close the meeting, we are supposed to come up with some ideas for.",0
"Industrial Designer: So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote, input which would probably be buttons, although we just talked about voice recognition, processor to take the information, something to transmit it to the TV, we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal, have an output, like possibly a beep or a vibration.",1
"User Interface: I think it would be helpful to find it, but I do not think it'd.",0
"Marketing: Even if we were to increase this entire thing by seven, we were to go down a grade to four, we would have to do I mean we did not we were not that kinda optimistic too optim overly optimistic.",0
Project Manager: Well they do not own tellys anyway do they?,0
Marketing: teletext is less relevant but also important.,0
Marketing: That does not c that does not co.,0
User Interface: Why ca not we stay here?,0
"Project Manager: I think we are gonna have to narrow it down, to say let is target these people, give them what they want.",1
Marketing: takes time to learn how to use them.,1
"Industrial Designer: And let is see I had to focus on the working design, which you said.",1
"Project Manager: we want it to cost, absolute maxim of twelve Euro, fifty cents.",1
Project Manager: but I'm going d I'm not going to.,0
Project Manager: what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype.,1
"Project Manager: so you are gonna have the three different sets of functionalities, I mean do you wanna group them into s head of the snowman, body of the snowman, inside of the snowman, is that what you are thinking?",1
"Industrial Designer: I think we all have a presentation again,",1
"User Interface: Yeah, everyone got enough input, I think.",1
"Project Manager: Let is see one, two God damn it.",0
"Project Manager: No I, no I dunno, I d I dunno,",1
Project Manager: So I will have to put that no wait we w many colours have we got there?,0
Project Manager: I will have to restore my my desktop.,0
"Project Manager: how many do y do you need, solar cells? Do you think one would be enough, or such as as number of branches?",1
"Industrial Designer: Like for example, voice recognition, right.",1
"Marketing: My slides were all blank, they'd have a title maybe.",1
User Interface: So lets you then you have less buttons.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, we could skip the numbers.",0
Industrial Designer: just talking to the manufacturing division.,0
Industrial Designer: It is like a gun.,0
Project Manager: thank you for your participation.,0
User Interface: But you should make sure that you have every button they need on it.,1
"User Interface: like 'cause if you just have like one menu button, that works like with a you know, or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the TV.",1
"Project Manager: Make them No, just make them black or grey or something.",0
"Marketing: if you are pressing enter, the thing would already be on, so maybe when you press power, initially it turns it on, press power again, use that as an enter.",1
"Industrial Designer: They just want it to be on, ready to go.",0
"Marketing: I'd go for a I ca we can adjust the volume on that, just as we could volume on TV.",0
Marketing: I do not think so.,0
Marketing: The target group.,1
Industrial Designer: well this is the basic function of a remote.,0
Industrial Designer: So something with give to it.,0
"Project Manager: the User Interface Designer is going to do the technical function design, user interface concept, user interface design.",0
"Industrial Designer: the menus Things like brightness, those kind of things we have put in the menu,",0
"Project Manager: Nah, I do not think so really,",0
"Marketing: Picture from scanner, clipart.",1
Project Manager: let is see.,0
"Industrial Designer: No what I maybe think is it seems the technology would be quite advanced for that, they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for the speech recognition.",0
"Project Manager: Yeah, yeah, but maybe you s yeah, maybe y you do, but I have never heard of it in the first place.",1
"Marketing: So we have the three birds, we have the design, that we have the fancy bit, right, the voice recognition is fancy, it is cool, it is different, it is radical, so, then we have an extra bit I do not remember so I'm pretty sure people will buy the remote, but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control, I think is a big question.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, yeah, the PlayDoh was best, I thought.",1
"Industrial Designer: Well we are not, sadly, going to actually be producing this, so.",0
"Project Manager: We need we need to have remote control which is fanc fancy, which is which is easy to hand not too small, not too big.",1
"Project Manager: So, you can draw a Yeah.",0
Project Manager: so we only need a simple chip.,1
User Interface: Is that manageable? 'Cause it sounds pretty expensive too.,1
Project Manager: And then a new blank document for.,0
"Industrial Designer: one would be video controls, the other one would be a device.",1
User Interface: So I think it'd be better maybe to concentrate on maybe just a universal one for TVs.,1
"Marketing: Because they use the remote control often more often, are more technical than the ol older people.",1
"Industrial Designer: the main energy will be taken from batteries that we can And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there, we must use additional source of energy, which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can supply everything.",1
Marketing: So maybe we should just refocus.,1
"Project Manager: And I have come up with the management come with the new proposal, I have to discuss a few points on this.",1
"Marketing: An, this you can yeah you can say that.",0
"Marketing: one is with LCD, without LCD.",0
"Project Manager: that must be made, but I do not know, here is standing whoa, we can celebrate now, but the end report is.",1
User Interface: I mean to certain cues.,0
"Marketing: I also have a f very simple presentation,",0
"Industrial Designer: That is just off the top of my head,",0
"Marketing: Colour, I gave it a one.",1
"Project Manager: Well, what I can suggest to you, Christine, if you need some the technical feedback, or some training, about this facility, especially for the speech recognition, I can recommend you some companies like Intel or IBM, because they are already in this speech recognition part.",1
User Interface: Just so you know I think I mean it was my understanding that before we were gonna stay in the midmarket range.,1
"Industrial Designer: And it if it is not, you just shake it a bit, add with power up again.",0
Project Manager: You are going to redesign something.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, but it is it is is a dif it is a fact that the th that bigger market you are talking about, we already cover that.",1
"Marketing: I think the whiteboard, for me, is the kind of thing I would use all the time, but it is not quite as useful as to us as it could have been, maybe just in the way that we use it, in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings, that could have been up on a board you know as opposed to in like in text.",1
"Marketing: So we got some the bad stuff we got, remotes are often lost.",1
Industrial Designer: I will do some research for the next meeting.,0
Marketing: but I will I will personally wo not give it beyond three.,0
Project Manager: with that we are aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros.,0
"Marketing: Whereas channel selection, which is very high relevance.",1
"Industrial Designer: Or we can have something that looks a bit nicer, I think it, wo not necessarily l look like a pineapple, but that may or may not be a good thing.",1
"Marketing: I do not know if that is something we are ready to look into technically, that is up to the design people, but it is s something worth thinking about, especially since the younger demographic is obviously the one that is gonna keep growing, so if that is the direction we are headed in it is something to think about.",1
Marketing: remote controls are bad for RSI.,1
Project Manager: It will be about the conceptual design.,0
User Interface: so I think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good.,1
"Project Manager: more interesting for our company of course, p profit aim, about fifty million Euro.",1
Project Manager: Well also we have to decide so it should be lightening in the dark I think because most people lost their remote control.,1
Project Manager: Because he is now have a scrollwheel that you can push in.,0
"Project Manager: the most functions we will use will be to add a new page, to go back, forward between pages, of course to save it every now, then.",0
"Industrial Designer: like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins,",1
"Project Manager: I liked the fact that we could say an idea, it'd be suggested that was not the best idea, but no one felt like shot down,",1
Marketing: I told about the home station.,1
"Marketing: it flips up, then you have got another layer of buttons underneath.",0
"User Interface: so, I mean, we are sort of beholden to them.",1
"User Interface: My name is Hamed Getabdar, I'm going to be Interface Designer in this project.",1
Marketing: Well it would certainly make a fancy design.,1
"User Interface: It is actual speech, so then you have to make sure that the speech recognizer is good enough to filter out the TV speech, the user is speech.",1
Project Manager: I think we are gonna have to wrap this up.,0
"Project Manager: Well I'd be inclined to say, if we can make the design better than any comparable remote while reducing the cost, then that is the way we really should play it.",1
"Project Manager: after the meeting we are gonna each complete a sks a questionnaire, a smaries smary.",0
Project Manager: Something that should be addressed later We should we should go to other for the other topics.,1
"Marketing: Yeah, the sample sensor will have to go, 'cause that is the most expensive thing on there.",1
"User Interface: n next I will explain one by one, the first is Google controller.",1
User Interface: You do not know why?,0
"Marketing: So, should we maybe say f a five.",0
"Marketing: This is basically talking about just the feel of it, so probably not the smell of it, but the bright colours, eyecatching, really bold designs, a spongy feel.",1
"User Interface: But, it it is not making any sound,",0
"Project Manager: you know, things like that.",1
"Marketing: World Cup soccer,",1
Marketing: I mean that what you are sayin that is what the design.,0
"Marketing: The fruity colours, the autumn colours, like red, brown, dark red, brown.",1
"Marketing: Yeah, I mean sort of taking upon that idea, w the way I see this i is that it is the s the structure in which we have approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork because the tasks were d sort of divided, then the work went on in isolation.",1
Marketing: So now I'm gonna scare everybody out of this project.,1
Marketing: than the screen.,0
Industrial Designer: yeah we should summon the different aspects of the thing.,0
"Industrial Designer: No, I did not.",0
Project Manager: New ideas found.,1
"User Interface: It is unbreakable, it is very universal.",0
Industrial Designer: But we d Then we have to lose the LCD screen.,1
"Marketing: They like spongy material,",1
Industrial Designer: You say familiarity is not important but .,0
"Project Manager: I al like I said, I lost the speech recognition, I lost the special colour,",1
"Project Manager: The little lightning bolt in it, very cute.",1
"User Interface: And here you just have one, few buttons.",1
"Project Manager: So what we could do perhaps, a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells or take out the backup battery.",1
"Industrial Designer: It is not been seen before, so it could be quite a, a novelty factor, attractive as well.",1
"Project Manager: The front side, no l no slogan.",0
"User Interface: A special form, right?",1
"Project Manager: And the functions are volume, channel to choose channels, an onoff, a mute button, a text TV button.",1
User Interface: I thought that was th.,0
"Marketing: Where the engineering ones, the boxes, tend to make it look more complicated than it really is.",0
"Project Manager: Because I think even if something has large buttons, as long as they are not childishly large, like even technically.",1
Project Manager: Do the also with the thumb.,0
"Industrial Designer: So maybe as you are discussing things, is it if we just keep highlighting things here?",0
"User Interface: I have never come across it before, but it sounds fantastic.",1
"User Interface: because it has an LCD screen, a mi microphone.",1
User Interface: Well I drew this.,0
"Industrial Designer: So, I have this.",0
Industrial Designer: But we will return to that.,0
"Project Manager: So people will use it more, especially for the help functions,",0
User Interface: You can display actual buttons on the touch screens.,0
"Industrial Designer: Should we make it a button, or some something which would be.",1
User Interface: But with all with logo on it.,1
Project Manager: You can st throw it at your little brother is head.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, what does the market want? I do not know.",0
"Marketing: As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without LCD it is going to reduce the cost also,",1
Marketing: I think stop function is very useful.,1
"Project Manager: because when I got the when I got the input for the financial results, initially of course I wanted to contact you.",0
"Industrial Designer: no I do not know anything, but maybe anyone else.",0
Industrial Designer: You can do it with your thumb.,1
Industrial Designer: And also for people who are a bit colourblind.,0
"Industrial Designer: One more thing I'd like to say, let is give this a name, not like some vague serial number that no one understands, like with cars.",1
Project Manager: And much cheaper as well.,1
"Project Manager: Cause my problem was, you guys had access to like they'd put send you to sites, stuff right?",1
Project Manager: Just think of the problem.,0
Industrial Designer: Single nee single curved.,1
Industrial Designer: And then we have the m The m.,0
Industrial Designer: But now button supplements.,0
"User Interface: What I was thinking about is just a menu structure, when you do not use it is simple.",1
Project Manager: I think it was good.,1
"Industrial Designer: But that will be very costly, I think.",1
"User Interface: Like, I think we are looking at something that could be, like even maybe like a cir I'm f I'm seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld like thing.",0
"Industrial Designer: I think the main thing is the usability, that is where we can make it a special product.",1
"Industrial Designer: I do not have any personal p preferences so far, except for the materials to be used light, that they are light.",1
"User Interface: and they are kind of awkward to hold onto,",0
"Marketing: Well, we ca not do that.",0
"Industrial Designer: There is no wood, so plastic just only, I think.",1
Industrial Designer: So I think this is the best of two worlds.,1
"Marketing: So if we stay away from it, s you know stay away from it, but if we are gonna go along with it then it does not necessarily have to be like an apple or something like that, or a kiwi fruit.",1
"User Interface: This is like a scroll, but they are push buttons, they enter takes you into the different menus.",1
"Marketing: But since we are conten concentrating on the younger group, I think we should use soft materials, make it colourful or like cell phones, exch exchangeable covers.",1
Industrial Designer: Just old fashioned kinda blackboard style.,1
Industrial Designer: And then you have something like th this under it.,1
"Marketing: We can make it smart like an iPod, you know, make everything menus.",1
"Project Manager: I find it really confusing, I kept getting lost in the phone, I di I have not got a new one but my friend got a new one.",1
Marketing: This is to do this I will not remove my microphone.,0
"Industrial Designer: For the buttons, we have an integrated push button, which is just to say all these are supplied by Real Reaction.",1
Industrial Designer: infrared beams an infrared beam I think.,1
"Industrial Designer: well, the to have the ability to write something to the navigator, maybe directly, or.",0
Project Manager: We wanted a standby function.,1
Marketing: And this one was sixteen Euros.,0
"Industrial Designer: Titanium would be be heavy, too,",1
"Marketing: But if we do have the voice recognition thing, there is a lot of stuff that you can get rid of.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, just th other buttons like text TV.",0
Marketing: Depends how much we sell.,0
"Project Manager: you always have in the centre an button, for your menu.",1
"Marketing: so our average there, five, six, eight, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fifteen, nineteen, twenty one, divided by eleven.",0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, I do not think it will work, Or we can also use solar cells.",1
"Industrial Designer: A yeah, otherwise it will be mis means you do not get b any feeling then.",0
"Industrial Designer: one issue for the buttons is, depending on which material we use, if we use rubber buttons then it requires a rubber case, so we have to take that into consideration.",1
"Industrial Designer: It is just, you know, it is not the most important, but it can be a part of.",0
User Interface: I like it a lot.,0
"Project Manager: just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project, I could I'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls, your first ideas about creating a new r remote control, what would be the best like you what are the features that you really like what are the features that you do not like, etcetera, so.",1
User Interface: here we go.,0
"User Interface: it is that I do not know, 'cause it is not my field.",0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, it most of the ones we have had have had the menu button, 'cause it is not like you need to have a button access to like change the contrast or something.",0
"User Interface: it is not the colour, so maybe you should make two, but it has R, R.",1
Project Manager: You will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches.,1
"Project Manager: I'm not sure if it costs a lot, that that is what he r.",1
"Project Manager: Well, hold on.",0
"Industrial Designer: So the batteries, I will start with the battery, right?",1
Industrial Designer: Or should be.,1
"Project Manager: Current colour, you can choose another colour.",1
User Interface: so that is very easy.,0
"Industrial Designer: So yeah, I have The only the only remote controls I have used usually come with the television, they are fairly basic.",0
"User Interface: Well, we work together on a project, but everybody has his own task.",1
"User Interface: sorry, I got it wrong.",0
"Project Manager: but there is a chance it is not, so.",0
Project Manager: We had a lot of the otherwise the technology today was kinda cool.,1
"User Interface: We have a menu button,",0
"User Interface: Yeah, it is possible, yeah, yeah.",0
"Project Manager: especially if you do them on too tight, you ca not get the leverage on them to undo them.",0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah? That is right, whether it is left hand or right hand,",0
"Industrial Designer: I am the Technical Designer,",0
"Industrial Designer: Sorry, but What do they mean with the curves?",0
User Interface: Is that included? In the twelve Euro or.,0
"Industrial Designer: And, does it have to work only in English, or in Dutch too or.",0
"Project Manager: But it can be in maybe in an a gradable version,",0
"Project Manager: I mean are you gonna have any buttons on that besides power, this thing? Or.",0
User Interface: And the eraser was another problem.,1
"Project Manager: Yeah yeah, p Exactly.",0
"User Interface: And do we have to have a normal black one, or.",0
Marketing: So that is gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like Spring is finally here.,1
Industrial Designer: The cost price is very low.,1
"Project Manager: During each step of each design we wi you will work s separately, individually on your specific tasks, will m we will meet to to discuss, take decisions about what you have you did, what we will do next.",0
"User Interface: yeah, second question is like, a mobile you can change the cover, you call it a skin or whatever.",1
"Industrial Designer: So, speech recognition well, LCD it is because it is common nowadays to use LCD,",0
Project Manager: It is an certainly a different colour from your average.,0
"Marketing: that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market, we should sort of concentrate on the channels, sort of power, also vole, that sort of thing, as Louisa said.",0
"Marketing: Audio settings, screen settings, even teletext, channel settings.",0
"Project Manager: It blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side, for example the possibility of having a USB connection is definitely not viable now.",1
"Project Manager: So no LCD, so for we have no button supplements, right?",0
Project Manager: Well we are to go for the international market rather than a local market but that would not necessarily preclude.,0
"User Interface: I think yeah, the battery should be in here, because it is just nothing,",1
"Industrial Designer: If you took away that, that will make it twelve point three five.",1
Project Manager: And of course we should have our image in the in the design.,1
"Industrial Designer: And even if it does does not match, it will People like colours that do not match.",0
"Industrial Designer: And these latex cases, there is just the plastic ones wo not allow the use of solar cells as an energy source source.",1
"Marketing: No, you have to put, switch channels at the top, because that is the most used function, teletext at the second.",0
Marketing: it is very innovative.,0
Project Manager: Not in mine.,1
Project Manager: yeah comp completely pointless for the inter for from the interaction point of v point of view.,1
Industrial Designer: Yeah I think it pretty much everything is covered.,0
User Interface: I think that might be back to the start.,0
User Interface: So you also need a menu button.,1
Industrial Designer: To change covers.,1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, there w there was enough room, but the finance.",1
"User Interface: But I mean, I d I do not I'm not sure I see the value in these.",0
Project Manager: b but I think we will.,0
Project Manager: That is fab guys.,0
"User Interface: that is so this is if you ask me personally, I would make fliptop with a trendy design, s maybe we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after continuous use usage, all that.",1
"Project Manager: That is what I always do,",0
Project Manager: Right so desert island discs.,0
"Project Manager: But it does not really matter, we just make it plastic.",1
Project Manager: Summary of the project.,1
Project Manager: Just n normal plain buttons.,1
Industrial Designer: Or you need to get the user to plug it in.,1
"User Interface: Well, volume, something like that.",0
"Project Manager: Twelve, a half Euros.",0
User Interface: It is a bit large.,0
"Marketing: A cross, or whatever.",0
"User Interface: Well, I have your PowerPoint presentation, I can get some inf information out of that.",0
"Industrial Designer: And as I said, I have no idea how PowerPoint works, so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal PowerPoint presentation.",1
Project Manager: let is have your let is get have the presentation?,0
"Project Manager: But yeah, stick with the same kind of kinda yeah, the same basic nonremote kind of remote design.",1
"Marketing: There is gonna be somebody going home, say sh this thing does not work for my DVD, my but I like these other things, so they keep it, they do not take it back.",1
"User Interface: It sounds really easy, what does the user do, what does the th remote control do, but there are quite some issues.",0
Marketing: I think it is most cheap or cheapest to just do the updates at the service centre or at the shop.,0
"Marketing: Again, we have already discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic buttons.",0
"Marketing: So as far as we know, a single function television remote control is us usable internationally?",1
"Project Manager: Make it kind of ergonomic kind of to hold,",1
"Industrial Designer: no, but I think that is something for Roo here to think about.",0
Project Manager: There is no We have a technical problem.,0
"User Interface: I think everyone has agreed that it is that it could be quite a useful thing, so.",0
Industrial Designer: This is gonna be flat.,0
"Industrial Designer: You have to it means that if it is sitting there for a long time it probably wo not work, but you have to sort of throw it between your hands every now, then, it will work.",0
"Industrial Designer: no, no, no, the Yeah, it is you you have put in three for the nber of kinetic cells, there should just be one.",1
"Industrial Designer: So probably double curved surface is the way to go, yeah.",1
Project Manager: We have to something special.,0
"User Interface: but when the o older people go in the shop, they see an orange remote control, it would be less appealing than a white one.",1
"Marketing: Yeah, we can have a sp like a spongy skin on it.",0
"Industrial Designer: We could make it that shape but just have different colours, call 'em the different fruits.",1
Marketing: The Real Remote.,1
"Marketing: No, we have sample speaker.",1
Project Manager: We put the fashion in electronics.,1
Industrial Designer: I read I read it on the.,0
"Marketing: See, you could there are two options.",0
"Project Manager: Also from a user, but all these things together.",0
"Marketing: So for the first one, we need to decide, did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote? .",1
"Marketing: Because if we make a ha whole new product, our own style, we c this is so difficult, a difficulty I think.",1
"Project Manager: but using how many batteries, for example? Are what Maybe what is the size of the battery.",0
Project Manager: But if we are bundling it unless we are selling their telly with the remote.,0
Industrial Designer: It is probably not sending.,0
"Project Manager: Every every one of us must draw our favourite animal,",0
Project Manager: you should all be getting an email pretty soon.,0
Marketing: but we have to take care like.,1
"Project Manager: And that way, because we are attaching what would be a small button to the TV, again say what, it would be a small transmitter, watch battery type scenario I would say, or something that if it was problems enough you could actually even just I do not power that might be something that we could look into.",1
Industrial Designer: Just kind of the squishy feel.,1
Industrial Designer: Right? the chip basically includes the infra infrared sender.,0
Marketing: and I do not know if yellow is gonna really be a hit.,0
"Marketing: N nothing, no costs at all.",0
"User Interface: o I was thinking something some smooth, sleek, little remote control with big userfriendly buttons, a menu that you can access.",1
"Project Manager: And you can also delete an entire page, but we ask you not to do that.",1
"Project Manager: well if we can do that, great.",0
Marketing: Maybe two years it is dead.,0
Marketing: Materials that people find pleasing.,1
"Industrial Designer: 'Cause sometimes look at this computer, th this laptop, it is all black,",1
Industrial Designer: But sometimes you put a.,0
"Industrial Designer: and it acts like the previous one,",1
Marketing: It is not it does not say.,0
"Marketing: and provide you ways of using them, I dunno, somehow,",0
Project Manager: This is the most simple.,0
"Marketing: So I guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing, people do not like that, the repetitive use, I guess, caused a strain.",1
"Project Manager: it is optional, somewhat optional, Ed wants the chip on print, that is what we were talking about that.",0
"User Interface: So I mean maybe this is excessively heavy, but I think it needs to have some weight,",1
"Marketing: and if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience, they will probably watch more channels than the older people.",1
"Industrial Designer: All it said was it gave sort of relative, some chips are more expensive than others, sort of things.",1
Project Manager: we have to we have to we have to move forward.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah I mean with that many options, you'd I'd think that the screen would be better,",0
Project Manager: So we keep the curve.,1
"Project Manager: something where you can read an fair amount of information, traverse maybe quite a few menus, if we maybe used mobile phones as a good example, they usually incorporate they have the keypad, then evr all the other functionality is usually associated inside by traversing around.",1
Marketing: Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user.,1
"Industrial Designer: And I have some pictures of the inside workings, but I do not want to get too technical,",1
"Project Manager: so we will have to investigate how much that will cost us, cost the company,",1
"User Interface: And then lastly, it is just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include, how simple, complex it should be? And what functions it needs to complete.",1
"Marketing: The most important things on a f on an on an remote control are channel selection, volume con selection,",1
User Interface: Well I actually did think about it myself but I thought you know because you could potentially you know you could be pushing it down as you scroll it for a instead of a turbo button.,0
"Industrial Designer: But you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone, or like a little cradle for your iPod.",1
"Project Manager: Well, we could say, well this special colour, that is not that is not there,",1
"Project Manager: So the cost is in the budget, the evaluation is, so I th I think we can now open champagne, make a huge party.",1
"Marketing: So they want something s really very simple, easy to use.",0
"Project Manager: and instead of colours, sorta colour options, they want corporate colour, slogan somehow implemented in the new design.",0
User Interface: But you cannot display all on a LCD.,1
Industrial Designer: So the chip knows what button you pressed.,1
"Marketing: But if we wanna make fifty million, have everyone want this remote control, we should maybe stick to the basics.",1
Industrial Designer: but in a sub submenu or something like that.,1
"User Interface: we have been focused all this time on the on the technical aspect, functional aspect, but also the simplicity.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, or how about I just click?, here is our agenda for this meeting.",1
Project Manager: And having meetings so that we can during the course of the day come up with a better inst implement than we had before.,0
Project Manager: I would give it a two still though.,1
User Interface: I think we discussed a lot of things about it.,0
"Project Manager: But also things like menus or p how about preferences of your with configuring your remote control for favourite your favourite channel for example, how do you configure that.",1
Marketing: cause otherwise your fingers ca not move around.,0
Marketing: So you'd know where it is in the room.,1
"Industrial Designer: and then it maybe buzzes to somewhere else, wherever the remote actually is.",1
"Industrial Designer: I mean calculators you do not really throw around a lot whereas remotes you do,",0
User Interface: I make a cat of it.,1
"User Interface: and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful, fancy, as fancy as the one on the LCD,",1
"Industrial Designer: For the case of the remotes itself, they can be a general case, which is just a flat one.",1
Industrial Designer: We could use the basic normal battery.,1
Industrial Designer: basically the for the I will back actually.,0
"User Interface: And if you want to make to s twentyfive, you push on this.",1
Project Manager: I I will be the Project Manager.,0
User Interface: so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content.,1
"Project Manager: so very intuitive design, I guess.",1
"Marketing: So let is see, we drop the price by one, a half.",0
"Marketing: And hard materials like wood, titani.",1
"User Interface: Which colour, the colour of the phone or the colour of the.",0
Project Manager: I do not think the user interface guy wants to touch it anymore.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, we make it som Maybe we have to make it from soft material.",1
User Interface: it is gonna have to be plastic.,0
Project Manager: It is more of a su it is more of a supplement maybe.,0
Industrial Designer: with a with a regular chip.,0
"User Interface: If we can build on this with the speech recognition, that is not something I'd thought about at all, but it is also something we can discuss.",1
"Marketing: Yeah, but the p print plate of L LCD screen is more advanced than a normal print plate,",1
"Industrial Designer: And ther there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller, she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it is this is not a you know action, there can be no action taking to that so.",1
"User Interface: giving you every possible function that the that the device has, the remote control controls.",1
"Industrial Designer: Perhaps we should also make something like a flash on it, if you if it is lost, for people that are deaf.",1
"Marketing: That is why I was thinking, Bluetooth, 'cause if you like put up Bluetooth, it is like a Bluetooth remote control, everybody is gonna like, 'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays, like it really is, like people when it comes to marketing like that is what people go for, they do not really care whether, you know, at the end of the day whether it works properly or not.",1
"Project Manager: you can still have the main buttons that allow the people to turn the machine on, off, d up, down, it depends, I mean maybe we have the fol the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then, that there is just a small nber of as you were saying buttons that have already been defined.",0
Marketing: I will go go for two.,0
"Industrial Designer: But it is more longlasting, that the people do not have to ever buy batteries again.",1
Project Manager: if it were the ball you'd no longer have to have a flat space on it.,0
Marketing: moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury.,1
Project Manager: So that one can be put away.,0
Project Manager: I think it is still in my own documents folder.,1
"Project Manager: singlecurved surface, so that we can fold it.",1
"Project Manager: And it is in the, I think, in the sharing folder.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, my vote goes out to the right.",0
"User Interface: Tomorrow you might have a some more functions which might come through that, so.",0
Industrial Designer: then we should be able to accommodate fairly decent sized buttons.,0
Project Manager: Probably a four at most.,1
Industrial Designer: but I think that was gonna cost a little more.,1
"Marketing: Another thing about these figures is ninety one percent of the youngest age groups said they'd do it, but probably a lot of them that is actually their parents money.",1
User Interface: I'm sure this would be the unique design the market.,1
User Interface: I think we should go further with the idea of a removable front.,1
"Marketing: I had no real specific ideas for this, maybe we just, the basic idea of having your core functions big, at the top maybe, by themselves,",1
"Project Manager: But anyhow, still we are under control, so what I will do is I will try to negotiate with the vendors, to get the production cost less, so then we can save some money, to put into th our marketing or you know the promotions, whatever, so that I will look after.",1
"Industrial Designer: We we have not really integrated this the speech into the system,",0
Marketing: I will that would very nice.,1
"Project Manager: Right so, success on the whiteboard.",0
"Industrial Designer: It is up to you, means.",0
Project Manager: well plastic rather than rubber.,0
User Interface: I'd g I'd rate I'd rate this fairly highly from that point of view actually.,0
Project Manager: We need the advanced yeah.,1
"User Interface: maybe then our market should be TV manufacturers, rather than the public.",1
"Marketing: Yeah, but we are we have yellow, red, black, titanium.",0
"Marketing: but I think I will just keep it simple,",0
"User Interface: Yeah, it should be easy to work with.",1
"Industrial Designer: And as the trendwatcher presentation showed, people like wood, but it raises the price, it does not really fit the image, unless we would start two product lines.",1
"User Interface: well, this is the total interface that f of the LCD screen.",0
"Project Manager: if you just click that it will go ahead, one at a time.",1
User Interface: I think two or three.,1
"User Interface: It sh it should be there, the manual.",1
"Industrial Designer: Because sometimes whe when you watch the TV in fact, you have a big display, maybe you do not need one more in your hands? I dunno, I'm just asking.",1
Marketing: I think many of us would associate those with fancy.,1
"Marketing: I mean if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds, we could go for the fancy stuff.",1
Industrial Designer: Hey it is back to the original.,0
"Industrial Designer: it says user interf so I'm supposed to do the components concept, supposed to work on the user interface concept,",1
User Interface: Looks a bit like a Game Boy now.,1
"User Interface: could I use the mouse, or.",0
"Project Manager: Yeah, we already have the th base station gadgets,",0
User Interface: at the same time as general voice commands if you want yeah.,0
"Project Manager: So, so first have to show you, maybe you can come here to have a look how it works.",1
"Marketing: I suppose we need we need to find out what circuit board that requires, maybe before we m make a decision.",1
Industrial Designer: Then the buttons?,0
"User Interface: Yeah, But, I mean, do you need that? If you can get to, you know if so long as you are able to bring up the menu on the TV screen.",0
"Marketing: Yeah, buttons are the standard buttons.",0
"User Interface: Right? Form curved, kind of smooth, handheld, makes it feel nice to hold.",1
"Project Manager: I al I I have filled that in a the questionnaires each time, so.",0
Industrial Designer: But how wi how will you be able to handle a whole market? There are a dozen of dozens of remote controls that have.,0
Project Manager: We have twenty five minutes.,0
"Marketing: How do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating, sharing information?",0
User Interface: that is the infrared thing.,0
Project Manager: Well it is not the yeah.,0
"Industrial Designer: Because you are obliged to put it in the charger, not to leave it in a couch between some cushions.",0
User Interface: So simplification of symbols you could think of.,1
"Industrial Designer: But I think we have to make the case transparent, otherwise the back light wo not work.",1
"Marketing: because just going back to mobile phones, I mean this the first change in remote control devices that I can really, you know, say is obvious, visible.",1
Project Manager: Because we do not have those customers a lot at th at this point.,0
Industrial Designer: Well but well e every possible word has a probability to come about of the TV so.,0
"Project Manager: mean we can look into using the s, you know, the little tiny weeny batteries, all like special longlasting batteries.",1
"Project Manager: I think we decided on the pushbuttons, right?",1
"Industrial Designer: round corners, but s but square, yeah.",1
"User Interface: I think with wood though you'd run into the same types of problems, would not you, I mean it chips, it if you drop it,",1
Project Manager: Then we go to fourteen point six.,1
"User Interface: Although the danger with that is, it could look a bit cheap.",0
"User Interface: Y you know, instead of remote control it is doing the some searching for you, so you do not have to look for the channel you want.",0
"Marketing: and Marketing Expert, it is me.",1
"Project Manager: what is your experience with remote controls, what kind of ideas do you have to design a new remote control, maybe for which market segments should we aim, or should we aim for all segments.",0
"User Interface: Advanced chip on print, right?",0
"Marketing: like you know what I mean, then it is like you would not need a remote you'd just talk to your TV.",0
"User Interface: And, this is rubber.",1
"Industrial Designer: And after that I put up a scheme about how these things are organised, I will show it to you in a in a few seconds.",0
Industrial Designer: So it is basically the concept we discussed before.,0
Industrial Designer: If if I run into any problems in my other projects it might be six months.,0
"Industrial Designer: in fact it could use it could mean, not.",0
"User Interface: Childfriendly, I thought this was good, as you pointed out the the bit, it often goes missing especially with children, but it is a good shape, the organic is kind of we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape, I think.",1
"Marketing: you know, i, I think I'm envisioning more like, you know, the material that you have when you sit on like a bicycle,",1
"Project Manager: Two minutes of drawing, yeah.",0
"Industrial Designer: And Of course that is controlled, the chip itself is controlled by the user interface.",1
Project Manager: And of course it should not be very costly.,1
Industrial Designer: Because they do not have anything to do with what you see.,0
Project Manager: It wo not get lost.,0
"Marketing: Yeah, like the shape of it almost like a mouse, with a.",1
"User Interface: and the market research has been on that side of things, has not it?",0
"Marketing: it incorporates current fashion trends, now that is particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior, the fruit, vegetable design colours.",1
"Industrial Designer: Good, well th that'd be something that manufacturing would have to explore more.",0
Project Manager: And that is because of cost restraints is it?,0
User Interface: That is just wrong.,0
Project Manager: given the state of the technology we want something that we kno we know will work.,0
"Project Manager: if we could hear from our Industrial engineer, or Designer.",0
"Marketing: we just go through these, rate them as a group, then at the end we will make an evaluation based on that, so just average the score of those items, so These are the things we identified as being important.",1
"Industrial Designer: And on the main board we have the interface to the microphone, which is somewhere, say here.",1
User Interface: Integrated with push buttons or you may have scroll button instead of p just the push button.,1
"Marketing: So I mean, I'm taking this to mean, you know, curviness.",1
Project Manager: I mean calculators for example.,1
"User Interface: I'd s I I'd give it a six, to be honest.",1
Project Manager: Not special colours an interest in?,0
Project Manager: Do have you guys found out if we can if we can email stuff to each other?,0
"Project Manager: If you press something, it lights up for a few seconds, so you can see what other but buttons there are,?",1
User Interface: We are using just a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic.,0
User Interface: It makes look more fruity as well.,1
"Project Manager: I do not know if it is a gimmick or not, but have any of you ever seen those odd little key rings where if you whistle, it will beep, you tell you where it is.",1
"Marketing: Because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons, so there is no point of having ninety percent buttons making the remote controls too bulky, too complicated too expensive a because I think I believe that technology is useful only if the consumers they want to use it.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, but we are gonna have to we really have to think I think colours is very important, because it has to be flashy, but, but it d it does not have to be annoying, that when you, know, some things is just over the top, when you have it on your table for more than two weeks, you it just gets annoying, because it is so big, flashy.",1
"Project Manager: Lot of good ideas, good facts to have.",0
User Interface: But the integrated button? How many func functions can it have?,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the remote control.",1
"Project Manager: So just from last time to recap, we said we were gonna have a snowman shaped remote control with no LCD display, no need for talkback, it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power, battery with rubber buttons, maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal LEDs to shine through the casing, hopefully a jogdial, incorporating the slogan somewhere as well.",1
User Interface: And also the cost for the speech recognition.,1
"Marketing: Maybe the display also makes it easier to use, because sometimes when you are looking for buttons, maybe if you see a display.",1
Project Manager: do not know how lo much longer we have got.,0
Project Manager: how are we going to do it with those numbers?,0
"Industrial Designer: If you press select once, they become channel changing buttons.",1
"Project Manager: And you are Francine, right? Would you like s like just to see how it feels, so that you have a little idea?",0
Industrial Designer: I thought of an idea like this.,0
Project Manager: To be replaced with a.,0
User Interface: The functionality in the future.,0
"Industrial Designer: I mean, you wanna ch flip the channel.",0
"Marketing: Ours has to be look really great, it has to come out before the others, so that we have a leg up on time to sell it, push it before other people get out their Christmas item.",0
"Industrial Designer: So like you press a one, that circuit is closed, Then the chip produces a pattern.",1
Project Manager: we do not sesh especially have the lightning.,0
Industrial Designer: we have The functions are just basic.,1
"Marketing: Yeah a audio settings, mono, stereo, pitch, bass, treble.",1
"Project Manager: so I think it is maybe if we can give me some kind of your the sales plan, including the technical what she is going to talk to you within the team, then it will help me to discuss with the management for further, put it in the proper project plan.",1
Project Manager: So that means redesign.,0
"Industrial Designer: I think it yeah, you will do an.",1
Project Manager: Banana is also yellow so you ca not lost your remote control then.,0
"Project Manager: That is a good idea, that is very original, that is can improve.",0
"Marketing: Yeah, that will be for the future, I guess.",0
"Project Manager: Well our functional design meeting, that is the stage we are in.",1
"Industrial Designer: but people had gotten the throwaway, you know, paper cups, napki y all kinds of things that they had not so, you are right, timing is very important,",1
"Industrial Designer: When you have a more advanced, elaborate user, well, such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions.",0
"Industrial Designer: especially we looked at the form, material, the colour.",1
"Project Manager: And now just let have some discussion about what is a good remote control, well keep in mind this first point, it has to be original, it has to be trendy, it has to be user friendly.",1
"Project Manager: I do not know, what time did we start this meeting, I'm not sure.",0
"Project Manager: So the grip is No, that would not work either.",0
User Interface: So this guy this is another company that provides big buttons.,1
"Industrial Designer: The underside, that is pretty cheap piece of technology really top left side you can see the chip, which is the, what we were talking about, this was is the device to recognise the signals the input, it passes it on to a row of further transistors, stuff like that on the right side that actually amplify the signal, which later on is being, is being transferred to a infrared lamp which then of course shines infrared light onto the television which then will recognise what signal it is getting, will do what you tell it.",1
Project Manager: But old people are not looking for that.,1
Project Manager: We have to do that every time we make something.,1
"User Interface: what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple, not fancy but not totally minimalist, I mean just pretty simple plastic, probably, I was thinking, yellow, black, just because that is the company is colours, with very few buttons, but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen, like, you know, just small along the bottom instead of instead of having the iPod style display screen on the actual remotes, which is far too expensive.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, I mean basically we can make these things out of wood, titanium, plastic or rubber.",1
"User Interface: to add on Ruud is information, in this interface we can have hightech with the voice recognition, well, the fancy colours, so on, still have the ease of use, because we have an easy interface.",1
Project Manager: The LCD is still on disc is still open to discussion.,0
"Project Manager: So those are the three things, just not to worry about teletext, only control the TV, incorporate the colour, slogan of the company.",1
"Marketing: And we have to discuss about, if we give it a one or a seven.",1
Marketing: That is exactly what I was thinking.,1
"Project Manager: Now, I ask you to presentate the prototype.",1
"User Interface: No I think rubber, since it is being used just as a casing,",1
"Industrial Designer: The push button are usually extremely cheap, but I just have one problem, this is related with the wheel sensor, which seems to be quite expensive.",1
"Industrial Designer: And if we if we are going to add an an LCD screen to it, it wo not look anything like this, but This is very basic basically the shape of of a remote control.",0
Industrial Designer: This I was thinking.,1
"Project Manager: as a team we are going to be designing, creating a new kind of remote control.",0
Project Manager: Should be a good point.,0
User Interface: Especially after the first meeting.,1
Project Manager: The keyboard shape.,1
"User Interface: Cause I'm pretty much accustomed to it right over here, at least in general,",0
"Project Manager: Steph gets the user interface design, you get product evaluation.",1
Project Manager: Launch different lines at once.,1
Marketing: People with more money.,1
Industrial Designer: It is quite goods.,0
Marketing: Yeah I think that think that is a good idea.,0
"Industrial Designer: Could you use perhaps one button for multiple functions, like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function for example.",1
"Marketing: The box is gonna sell it I think, the outside, the casing.",1
"Project Manager: If I had a cool new TV, this was r looking really slick, it had the dock, it had the scroll wheel, which I think is a really cool idea, that would sell me on it a little.",0
"Project Manager: Yeah, but we want to make the wood colours, that.",0
Marketing: Does it have legs?,0
"Project Manager: so do we wanna go for that, or do we want to go for an older demographic, my thought is we have got w if we are gonna go for a sleek look I mean we are putting the fashion in electronics.",1
Industrial Designer: Sure why not why not.,0
"User Interface: No, eh? I do not know.",0
"Marketing: From what I had in mind we are supposed to be marketing coffee, is that right?",0
"Marketing: Well, I'm going to tell you something about functional requirements.",1
"User Interface: what we can do is, well you know that batteries throwing a aw remotes run through batteries like crazy.",1
Marketing: there was some research on new features in a remote control.,0
"Project Manager: Y we want to it is simplicity, w you have two big buttons, you can do whatever you want with these two buttons, so you do not need an LCD.",0
"Project Manager: I wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition, given that the now the age structure we were looking at I mean w we had usage by age structure, what we did not have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups.",1
"Project Manager: And what people just think about, well, I will never have to buy any r batteries again, so y b because it is very annoying when your battery is empty.",1
"Marketing: Yeah, th that is another really good point.",0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, so it is just like the same products, but just put together in a different way.",1
User Interface: As for the design maybe we c should hire a designer to help.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, maybe some some text next to the scroll wheel, that it is volume.",1
"Marketing: criteria B, criterion B, technologically innovative.",0
Marketing: This would also greatly increase the production costs but I think these are just some small factors we could consider.,1
"Project Manager: I think it is I'm not I'm not sure,",0
"Project Manager: Industrial Designer, you are the one, you know, you are gonna be working out kind of box it goes in, I guess so, whether it is what goes into the box, somehow.",1
Marketing: Even if it were their covers.,1
"Industrial Designer: Right? This is the user interface, there we have the chip.",1
User Interface: We will have more money if we keep it simple.,0
Project Manager: The user interface design.,1
Project Manager: Then we will look at the finance.,1
"Project Manager: So the components of the thing should be button, bulbs, infra infrared bulbs, battery, chips, wires, maybe some kind of a holder for the for the item.",0
"User Interface: and maybe use a touch screen, or if that is will become too difficult just like televi some o older telephones use a l maybe it is possible to flip them open, just expand the number of options that are normally visible.",1
Marketing: Yeah again I'm not sold on the product because we do not have a product in my opinion yet.,0
Project Manager: it is just sold as a package.,0
Marketing: So Alright? Any comments on all of that?,0
"Project Manager: so if you say something about marketing, right, sorted, y is.",0
"Industrial Designer: You can go into you in you main menu,",0
User Interface: If he makes it a four.,0
"Marketing: And this bit is this one easy to use for visitors or for anybody? I guess it is just the same as saying easy to use interface, so it is kinda condensed into one.",1
User Interface: Something that you know it would sort of fit in the hand better.,1
"Project Manager: And I know all your names again, Courtney, Fenella, Amber.",1
"Project Manager: I have one thing about it, but it is a small thing, but it'd mean we'd have to make a righthanded one, a lefthanded one.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, more expensive.",0
Industrial Designer: Because I remember when I was a young child with my sister we yeah we always want to w to watch different emission at the at the same time.,0
"User Interface: I I prefer remote control working with radio waves, because remote control working with infrared rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction, then try it hard to tune.",0
"Project Manager: And as well as that, the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we have just come up with using modelling clay, you will get extra instructions from your personal coach.",1
"Project Manager: So for this first part here powerwise, have we got battery?",1
"Project Manager: Now we kind of have to come to some decisions, I figure we can just go down the line, all three of us can have a chat about it.",0
User Interface: Does not say.,0
"Project Manager: Maybe we could have key buttons, like discovery channe like documentary channel, movies channel,",1
Industrial Designer: It is a common stan standard way.,0
Marketing: And they wo not like it.,0
"Project Manager: It is a very nice elephant, you can see.",1
Marketing: That there was a lot of room for it.,1
"Marketing: we have to have something completely different.? Easy to use, has always has become has become another major interest that, with the whiteboard we can see that it is a remote that is easy to use.",1
Industrial Designer: I wi I wo not.,0
"Marketing: Yeah, the drawings are hard to make, I think.",0
Industrial Designer: You can just put it somewhere.,0
"Industrial Designer: So we can have pushbuttons, like most remotes do, our company is an expert in making pushbuttons.",1
Industrial Designer: I think the supplement can be the voice.,0
User Interface: Bu but stressful.,1
"Project Manager: And we have talked about there being an alarm or something, a beeping for being lost.",1
Industrial Designer: We are burs bursting with creativity.,0
"Project Manager: So, it just helps me summarize them.",0
Project Manager: I think that might be a little impractical though.,1
"User Interface: I think it would be good to know if there is any leverage in that any leeway in that that twenty five Euro because for twenty five Euro I think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control, that seems to be kind of against the philosophy of our company which is you know putting the fashion into electronics.",1
"Project Manager: So then I will ask the User Interf Interface Designer to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons, the fact that is lighted or not, things like that, what would be convenient for the user.",1
"Marketing: Yeah, which is the next big thing, so that is not gonna hurt us either.",0
"Industrial Designer: But there will be some additional buttons, I guess.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, but we which makes it kind of really big, yeah.",1
"Marketing: cause we all needed them separately, kind of on the whiteboards in this room.",1
"Project Manager: it is vibrating, that is strange.",0
"Industrial Designer: Cause that is the the biggest expense there, right.",0
Project Manager: If we are aiming for fifty million Euros we are gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them.,0
Marketing: And it kind of just went down incrementally.,1
"Project Manager: Are the costs within budget? Yes, yes.",0
Marketing: Just Before I bring this up what I will just say is what I have what I have done is tried to collect some information so that I can then relay this to you guys so that it is now becomes a collective thing.,0
User Interface: yeah you should present that.,0
"Project Manager: Something which you when you press that, it would beep to give its location away, on the remote unit.",1
Marketing: I think we can make a docking station.,1
Marketing: Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use?,0
User Interface: it is fairly standard.,0
User Interface: and all the buttons are accessible from your thumb.,1
User Interface: Just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like having multiple face but it is.,0
"Industrial Designer: I did learn something new, PlayDoh is useful.",1
User Interface: We need some kinda of power d power source.,1
"Project Manager: Like how much does, you know, a remote control cost.",1
Project Manager: So we have got our sort of keyboard kind.,0
"Marketing: And also go for a spongy feel, so the question of our technology whate is Industrial Designer.",1
"Project Manager: How much would you give on the fancy aspect, on the fashionable aspect?",1
Marketing: And if I am a German then I would like to have the my options in German.,1
"Marketing: But think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control, in a way.",1
"User Interface: And I think, 'cause we do not have that many buttons,",1
"User Interface: Well I missed the option to to email,",0
User Interface: But we do not want it to be Yeah.,0
"Marketing: Yeah, but I Here I have the s the homepage of our internet,",0
"Industrial Designer: then we have on back on the front the logo in the upper corner,",0
Industrial Designer: These are kind of next generation functionalities.,1
User Interface: And you could page the remote if you lose it.,1
User Interface: so that is easy to use.,0
"Industrial Designer: But yeah then the information came, it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that I had to follow, so I was trying to organise them for myself.",1
"Industrial Designer: So I have been looking at the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate, I have had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division, who have told me what is actually available, you know, what the current state of the art in components is, some of the exciting new things they have got, but I'm not sure that it is quite what you want.",1
Marketing: say eighty commands or so.,1
"Project Manager: It think we we have done good job, as the cost is.",0
"User Interface: we are not going to be able to sell it for twentyfive then, with an LCD screen.",1
Industrial Designer: And the joystick away.,0
"Marketing: hence our motto, we put the fashion in electronics.",1
"Project Manager: It is impossible, I think.",0
"User Interface: So, in terms of the functionalities that we need, you obviously need to be able to turn the TV on, off.",1
"Marketing: And, what else? The RSI compares to the current standards,",1
User Interface: It is a pussy cat.,0
User Interface: It should be easier with that.,0
"Industrial Designer: So what I'm gonna present here is very yeah basic knowledge about the all the components that are inside a RC a remote control, how is it manufactured h what is the process, just to explain you.",1
"Industrial Designer: Does not need to be completely yellow,",0
"Marketing: And, maybe, yeah, a b a banana is is n not easy for a remote control, but m yeah.",1
Project Manager: We will look at.,0
"Marketing: This is now talking about who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control, who would pay more for it.",1
User Interface: And it is practical.,0
Project Manager: The only snag about this is that the cost is probably kind of important.,0
"Marketing: look, feel? Where one is I have broken the pen again.",0
Marketing: And then teletext was the next.,1
"Project Manager: This one is for the presentations, the PowerPoint presentations or the Word presentation of whatever you you had.",1
"Project Manager: Now, w we have to decide Well, we have to decide on the concept.",1
Project Manager: Then our agenda.,1
"Marketing: A minus here, plus over here.",1
Project Manager: We going to try it.,1
"User Interface: my own preferences, I prefer the clunky one.",1
"Marketing: Yeah, no not forgetting about the fruits, vegetables trends.",0
"User Interface: It is a difficult choice, either here or there.",0
Project Manager: I do not care.,0
Industrial Designer: so you can mass produce 'em pretty cheap.,0
"Marketing: Yeah, but you can save it u the under another name.",1
Project Manager: And our profit aim is fifteen million Euros.,1
"User Interface: I no I think that i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality, of course comes with reasonable cost.",0
Project Manager: Maybe it is a little more curves or whatever.,0
Project Manager: Specific instructions will be sent to you by your person by your personal coach.,1
"Marketing: We have more, we have got those the scroll wheel on the side.",0
"Industrial Designer: Final prototype, yeah, ye yeah.",0
Marketing: I have some figure.,0
"Project Manager: So have a wheel for incremental, have the digits on the lower side that can be closed so as you say protected,",1
Industrial Designer: But I think you can read it.,0
Marketing: Since it is the only one of its kind on the market it is obviously gonna be ours.,0
User Interface: Is this for the project or.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah you click the button, it is gonna send out a signal, I was thinking, IR is line of sight, so unless the remote is like actually in front of the TV it is not gonna work, so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone.",1
Marketing: And probably a power one as well.,1
"User Interface: So but I'm saying like, does it make sense to have like some kind of a button, so like you are if you are on TV, like you can switch channels, but then if if you are on DVD then like the channel bu like the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks or s you know, to different I mean do we need to think about that,",1
Marketing: So it is advanced integrated circuits?,0
"Project Manager: yeah, I thought we all worked very well together.",1
"Marketing: Yeah, yeah, most th they want to spend money for a better system, for better remote control, so we can do a l a little nice things with it, they use yeah, they use zap a lot, fifty percent say they only So that is the most important things.",1
"Marketing: So you count one degree, two degrees, no.",0
Marketing: Yeah the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit.,0
"Marketing: Actually, I'm ready to sell it.",0
"Project Manager: Maybe we should reevaluate the product, but we did that before, we also evaluated the project.",1
Marketing: sixteen plus six.,0
User Interface: I think that was the m biggest problem.,1
Project Manager: This is our agenda.,1
Industrial Designer: Yeah but they base that on the user specifications.,0
Marketing: What do you say? Easy to use? Five or a six?,0
User Interface: I can hold it like.,0
Marketing: So we can pretty much just do whatever we want.,0
"User Interface: But if we use a battery station, which I think we will use.",1
"User Interface: Well I was just wondering about if we are gonna do a product evaluation then what about time for redesign if the users come back, tell us no this is bad, this is bad, we want this done differently.",1
"Project Manager: then we will see what will be our product, what will be the different step we will have to design it.",0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, singe single side curved or double side curved does not say too much, does it?",1
"Marketing: Where does it says we have to make a remote, because I presumed She did not know who.",1
Project Manager: Yeah th I think they count the materials.,0
"Project Manager: you know, both individually, as a team.",0
"Project Manager: we have half rubber, half plastic.",1
"Industrial Designer: I think we take into account what you said about fruit, vegetable you know.",0
Marketing: That is really usable.,0
Project Manager: Yeah it is the right shape is not it?,0
Marketing: And a scrollwheel.,1
"Project Manager: The the further work to be done is i the the functional design, what it what it must actually do, the conceptual design, how we actually present that to the conser, th the detailed design i is how we get that into production.",0
"Marketing: We brought up the idea of having two pieces, which we could discuss further.",1
Industrial Designer: so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about fifteen dollars.,0
"User Interface: So it could be like, where is the remote, the remote answers I am here.",1
Project Manager: So we have to decide on the different remote control functions.,1
"Industrial Designer: i it kind of depends if we are gonna have the speech recognition, we'd have to probably get an advanced one.",1
Marketing: but you can To make it more trendy.,0
Marketing: It is very fancy.,0
"Industrial Designer: No, I'm not talking about that cost but the one that g has given us the order to design this.",1
Marketing: I think it'd definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext.,1
"Industrial Designer: I think another point is that the meetings are more brainstorming sessions than meetings,",0
Project Manager: Next meeting is called the detailed design.,1
Marketing: we should plug it in.,0
"Industrial Designer: And speech recognition in remote unit, it will be very e expensive.",1
Project Manager: Yeah I got it by.,0
"Project Manager: So I already calculated that, it is still in the budget.",1
"Industrial Designer: for the casing, the manufacturing department can deliver a flat casing, single or double curved casing.",1
"Marketing: Yeah maybe we could have used the whiteboard a little bit more, yeah,",0
"Project Manager: I think between the two, somewhere between the two is true.",1
Project Manager: That was that.,0
"User Interface: Well you can have the basic things on the same place, like on off button on top, the TV channels one two three four as a block, then the vole obviously on t on top, so you can see.",1
"Project Manager: The new remote control is to be original, trendy, userfriendly.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, simple, 'cause we have just got push buttons, so we can do it all with simple which is the ch should be the cheapest.",0
"Marketing: With seven being false, we did not achieve that.",1
"User Interface: so the method, we looked at existing designs, what are the what is good about them, what is bad about them, I looked at their flaws, so we are going to look at their flaws, everything.",1
"Marketing: And voice recognition, the software, open source software exist already.",1
"Project Manager: So, draw us your favourite animal.",1
"Industrial Designer: But should it really be clickable,",0
"Marketing: So we want to have a product fancy look, feel, technologically innovative, easy to use, fashion, easy to find in a room, robust,",1
Industrial Designer: I think it wo not be a big problem.,0
"User Interface: I'm not sure if it is a good idea to have a two sided remote though, 'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it.",1
"Industrial Designer: first in the power supply, we have the option of just the standard battery.",1
Project Manager: New products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty.,1
"Industrial Designer: chip on print, I think what they mean with the regular rubber buttons that you got, it is always clear for the remote control when you press a certain button.",1
Marketing: You have found it all?,0
Industrial Designer: It is like a sponge.,1
Project Manager: so just finish it.,0
"Marketing: but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising, I'm thinking the teenager, the someone fifteen to thirty five would go out, get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers.",1
"Marketing: Up to three for that,",1
"User Interface: and it gives a lot of functionality, in this way, so all we have th you see there are only six keys, but do not worry they are ma they are doing the job of twelve keys actually here.",1
Industrial Designer: but it can be a crocodile now actually.,1
"Marketing: But I think that with the current price that we are searching for, we are well within, even on the lower end, of the of the market.",1
Marketing: that is how the fashion guys state it.,0
User Interface: So you are display on the screen.,1
"Marketing: the scroll button, from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button.",1
"Industrial Designer: Seven, eight, ei eight Euros.",0
"Project Manager: plastic for some reason incurs no cost, which I have had to very much make advantage of, despite the fact that rubber is only got a value of two Euros per unit.",0
Marketing: A one a one.,0
User Interface: but the pro I think the problem with a lot of the sort of user focused designs that are about is that they sort of make assptions in advance about what what a given user is going to want mo want to do from want it to do most.,0
Industrial Designer: Well we We j we will just give them an.,0
Marketing: That is a one for me.,0
Industrial Designer: I think it does.,1
"Marketing: How far we actually want to go along, sort of follow the trends, do we think the trends are particularly important for this type of gadget, or you know, do they not matter that much?",1
Project Manager: And what were the other points to improve this whole process?,0
"Industrial Designer: To reduce the cost, it is.",1
User Interface: So So I'm working on the technical functions design.,1
"Marketing: I mean, what functions do they have.",1
Industrial Designer: But speech recogniser can be possible.,1
Project Manager: So I call the meeting closed.,1
User Interface: so very brief presentation.,1
"Marketing: Well, it was on, but.",0
"Industrial Designer: Maybe almost like a hairbrush, like you could get the about the width of that end of the pen, then it widens up top.",0
"User Interface: We have choices in materials, choices in the general shapes that we can do.",0
"Project Manager: talk about? when we move on, you two are going to be playing with playdough.",1
"Industrial Designer: or you can change your batteries,",1
"Industrial Designer: But solar energy is not very practical inside a house, because you do not have a have a lot of sun.",1
Project Manager: So first I wanna ask the Industrial Designer to tell what he did.,1
"Marketing: And one is going to mean true, that we did actually achieve that.",1
Marketing: well I received an email.,0
"Project Manager: The requirements, the target market.",0
"Project Manager: It is still it is still got to get within our twelve fifty, you know.",0
Marketing: and the demokraphi demographic of the second one?,0
"User Interface: By the Perhaps you can save this one, then copy or something.",1
"Industrial Designer: The switch if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor, that thinks over a Morse code, that is how you should see it.",1
"User Interface: Yeah, that is probably a better one, to discuss it straight away.",1
"Industrial Designer: But when you got a LCD screen, with no with not the buttons are not always on the same place,",1
"Project Manager: In i in my opinion purely feel is very good, is very good in your hand,",1
"Project Manager: Kate presented a working design of going after going over the basics on the whiteboard that it should be a simple massproduced device, because of the twelve, a half Pence cost.",0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, this is actually two curves, yeah.",1
"User Interface: And, it is on the back is cover or back lid, because if you flip it open, you can still do the scrolling here.",1
"User Interface: and so if you say hello coffee machine, it say hi Joe, or something like that, you know,",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, that is true,",1
Project Manager: I was thinking if it was like this.,0
Marketing: style is nber one thing in the in the market of who we are selling to.,0
"Marketing: these long, brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface.",0
Industrial Designer: Yeah it says right here.,0
"Marketing: It is a little bit I lost it,",0
Industrial Designer: But I do not know how much higher.,0
User Interface: And these these s these buttons are more triangleish shaped.,0
Industrial Designer: I mean everything speaks for itself I guess.,1
"Project Manager: Well, it looks yeah, well.",0
Industrial Designer: I think you have nice colours.,0
Industrial Designer: I will have to research.,0
Marketing: I wondered why yours always looked so more complicated.,0
Project Manager: I think the LCD is cheaper than speech recognition.,0
"Industrial Designer: So, maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges, stuff for strawberries, different colours.",1
"User Interface: And as for as for well budgeting as well, if we are gonna have lots of different interchangeable components.",0
"User Interface: Yes, well this is it.",1
"Marketing: So, that is one thing to keep in mind.",0
Project Manager: We do not have all the options.,0
"Marketing: basically what I wanna do here, before we get into it too far, is I want to show you all the background information I have that I think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful.",1
"Marketing: But that is seven basic buttons right, seven buttons without any addson, without special colours or form or material.",1
"Marketing: from the marketing yeah, from the marketing side, just to give an idea what the management is looking for, I was looking for a remote control to have a s.",1
"Project Manager: energy what do you think that is suggesting we are how we are powering the thing? I really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the backup of the battery, but have kinetic power,",0
Project Manager: our next meeting will be in half an hour.,1
User Interface: so this is the technical functions design.,1
"Project Manager: But, were there buttons on there as well?",0
"User Interface: Well, just give it a two.",1
"Project Manager: Then I'm going to talk about the project management, what I'm going to do, of course, I'm doing the project management, secretary both, to take the minutes of the meeting.",1
"Marketing: This would definitely be different enough, I just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more.",1
Industrial Designer: So Type of m maybe another market segment.,0
Industrial Designer: And the chipset really should be advanced because otherwise it would really be a simple remote control.,1
"User Interface: Then your lights would go off, though.",0
"Marketing: I will explain myself here now in the sense that in a in the recent surveys, from the ages fr from fifteen to thirtyfive, eighty percent are willing to spend more money for something as fancy as trendy.",1
"Industrial Designer: But yeah I think we need to compromise between those two, somehow we will do that.",0
Marketing: I agree on that.,0
"Project Manager: So, that would that would work out fine if as assuming your correction are assuming that one change covers all the buttons, then that would be fine.",1
Project Manager: I dunno about you guys but I felt like a bit understimulated on the whole thing.,1
User Interface: You ma can make an especialised extra gold version.,0
"Marketing: And it should be customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language, something.",0
"Project Manager: I think of in the end, ideas that can be used sadly.",1
"Project Manager: or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five, I think they will be bored after a while.",1
"Project Manager: Or you know However, however you wanted to go about it, the holder could also be the charging unit.",1
Project Manager: Just for television.,1
Marketing: I think that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper the than the LCD.,0
Industrial Designer: is not it? do we have.,0
Marketing: But not a real sponge.,1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, just a lemon TV it'd be yellow lemon.",0
Project Manager: yeah well we have some time.,0
"Project Manager: I do not like the, you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windowsbased running system.",1
"User Interface: Al all circuit boards are pretty much the same, I think.",1
Marketing: of put it in a recharger.,1
"Marketing: On the wheel, like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute.",1
"Project Manager: So if you scroll to a number, then you wait a half second, then it g turns to that channel.",1
Marketing: cause of course they ca not give you anything comparable to the internet for the.,0
Project Manager: when I my personal taste is that I want it to fall over my hands with a thick But In the market.,0
Marketing: we might come to that later.,0
"User Interface: I was saying that titanium, if we are being restricted then I would probably lean away from that.",0
Project Manager: The Sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or.,0
"Marketing: different parts of the world too, if we are if we are marketing internationally.",0
Industrial Designer: you said something about visibility in the dark.,0
Industrial Designer: Because we might need it to be curved for the thumb to use the joyst joystick easily.,0
"Industrial Designer: And by closing that certain circuit, the chip knows what bu button is pressed.",1
Project Manager: It could even be one of our selling points.,1
"User Interface: I do not want a banana on my living room table, a banana remote.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this, if you have an object.",1
Project Manager: Then you go away.,1
"Industrial Designer: And when it is switched off, you can push a button as it is working now, so And then he saves that setting.",0
"Project Manager: Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news, we have twenty four hour news channels now too, so Those are our new product requirements.",1
User Interface: is not possible to make combination with kind of rubber is or bendable remotes where you have got a.,0
"Project Manager: And then we can report back at the next meeting, say right yes, we have achieved this or we have not achieved this, this is how far we have progressed.",0
Project Manager: So we have seen the prototype.,1
"User Interface: As it turned out, the whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly well from the point of view of operating the function buttons, joystick, though it might be an idea to be able to a adjust the positions for the base of the joystick just a little bit for.",1
User Interface: It will make a difference.,0
Marketing: We should have an LCD on the rem remote control.,1
Marketing: Well we ca not no we ca not do evaluation 'til we have a design.,0
"Industrial Designer: An LED, which is a light emitting diode, contact discs for the buttons, plastic for the casing, a powersource, whatever powersource we have actually determined we want.",1
"Industrial Designer: But whether that would be too much to incorporate in production,",0
"Industrial Designer: the basic way is to use a an integrated circuit, some transistors with an that aims at communicating the message, to send the message to the to the led that will transmit to the receiver.",0
Project Manager: so we will go back to our own work.,0
"User Interface: so things that seem like absolute musthaves would be a vole control, so updown keys for that, channel keys updown, but then also a nerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want, rather than doing updown, a mute button.",1
"Marketing: I do not think we have to be, we have to agree on that.",1
User Interface: That is one piece of rubber but it is gonna have twelve button things underneath so.,0
"User Interface: search for the buttons, which one is which.",0
Marketing: less important functions should be discarded from the remote control.,0
Industrial Designer: I was thinking titanium myself.,1
"Marketing: I think we should we could that we could also implement a audio settings, screen settings, channel settings, but as submenus.",1
Project Manager: So we will close this meeting.,0
"Project Manager: And it sounded like we had set like eight or nine buttons, including five preset channels.? Let is do the look, feel design presentation first.",0
"User Interface: So yur user interface, guys, is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear, or otherwise perceive.",1
User Interface: Like a like a mobile phone?,0
Project Manager: Do you Do you have this information on the web page you said?,0
"User Interface: Yeah, our method is going to be, provide simple.",0
"Marketing: And in the end, we will c count an average of all rating.",1
"Project Manager: And that is selling them on the international market, not just in the UK.",1
Industrial Designer: If we want to make it.,1
User Interface: And so an elder designer picks up th the of.,0
"Marketing: So double curved is like this, this, this, or.",1
"Marketing: You really did a good job on that, my little designers.",0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, but is not it hard to remember? Like favourite one,",0
"Industrial Designer: So tha yeah, we definitely need to operate within our constraints,",1
"Project Manager: the next, thing we need to address is our financial department, to meet our budget, or not meet our budget but more, like what kind of, selling range we will be looking at, wanna make this selling price of twenty five Euros.",1
User Interface: but unfortunately it does lack the advanced functions which I quite like having on the controls.,0
Industrial Designer: Maybe you should another pen.,0
"Marketing: And also it helps in terms of people not losing this,",1
Project Manager: I have some instructions now to do that.,1
Project Manager: it is literally that will come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text.,0
"Industrial Designer: But I think w you will use the switch channels buttons more often than the normal channel buttons, like one two three.",1
"Industrial Designer: And if we put an LCD thing on it, then the costs will be much higher.",0
"Project Manager: But then still, when we there is no room for a docking station or something.",1
User Interface: shou should we make a list of the of all the functions we want.,0
Project Manager: So well we are under the cost.,0
Industrial Designer: Yeah it is just a logo.,0
"User Interface: It has fastforward, stop, play, all relating to movies.",1
"Industrial Designer: I think we can do it if we use conventional batteries, not have solar cells or kinetic.",0
"Marketing: Because it has to be something totally different, has to be total totally new.",0
"Marketing: I think, unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the LCD display.",1
"User Interface: Yeah, how much is it?",0
"Project Manager: The market range is international, so it is gonna be sold worldwide, the production cost should be a maximum of twelve Euro fifty per remote control.",1
"Project Manager: Until you have got the right nber, then you push it.",1
"Industrial Designer: but when the banana is curving like that, with the wheel on the top, to control,",1
User Interface: cause you have to add it.,0
"Project Manager: We have a Back, a button.",0
"Project Manager: So maybe we have to keep it like a square, just normal remote control.",1
User Interface: We have a slight problem.,0
"Marketing: And I will see what the user wants, what we can do with the new produ project product.",0
"Project Manager: I just say Can you s just say it again, because I was just looking There is just a short.",0
"Marketing: So, we are going for a titanium back, a plastic front?",0
"Project Manager: if I'm right, there are three presentations, I guess each one of you has prepared one? Good.",1
Project Manager: So lack of information about prices.,1
Industrial Designer: I will go first.,1
Marketing: And the menu button does also does the function then.,1
Industrial Designer: cause w our meeting time has run out.,1
"Project Manager: Under the shared folder, I do not know it might not even be under yours as well.",0
"Marketing: Using the using the d swi the power switch to switch on TV is a high relevance of nine, but it is not frequently used.",1
Marketing: How to select the next or.,0
Project Manager: I dunno if it can fit with the technology.,1
Project Manager: well I think the meeting will be over within a minute.,1
"User Interface: I th I think I would largely want to actually steer clear of the whole sort of fruit, veg thing.",0
Marketing: Though I did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day.,1
User Interface: Ea easy to use.,0
"User Interface: Second is we checked into competitors, the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here.",1
"Project Manager: So, depends on the LCD, the scroll.",1
Project Manager: we have to stop it now.,1
"User Interface: because, I'm not sure exactly where we are gonna sell this, but I presume it is not gonna just be English speaking countries.",0
Project Manager: or maybe a yellow light for the keys.,1
"Industrial Designer: I mean watermelon, you know, m probably appealing to the.",0
Project Manager: I think it is a five.,1
"User Interface: so, want me to draw my favourite animal.",1
"Industrial Designer: Well we can still design a twopiece remote without having a base, having one of them be a base station,",1
"User Interface: You can Just like a mobile phone, you can make different fronts on it.",1
"Industrial Designer: Wood, do you think wood will be a good idea?",0
"Project Manager: So, I will present myself, I'm Ada Longmund, as you may know it, I'm the pr project manager.",1
"User Interface: In analysing these we can consider what things what is good about them, what things do they get right, what is bad about them, what is wrong with 'em, how we can improve on the designs that I found, what can we do to make our product stand out from the large majority of remote controls.",0
Project Manager: Just takes so long.,0
User Interface: Yeah m perha yeah.,0
"Project Manager: The production price, twelve, a half Euros, approximately.",1
Project Manager: that I think that is the next meeting.,1
"User Interface: If you are in the market for this ultimate remote, you are not gonna go for just a television remote.",0
"Project Manager: And, the next presenter will be Tara.",1
"Industrial Designer: I have to check that out,",1
"User Interface: So it would be curved, single curve.",1
"User Interface: That, I think that is good, yeah.",0
"Project Manager: yes sorry, four point three.",0
"Project Manager: I'd like to do it in this order, first do the conceptual specification of components, properties, materials, then the conceptual specification of user interface, finally trend watching.",1
Industrial Designer: Save as project.,1
"Project Manager: Yeah, we should do a little thing about design, because it looks boring really to me.",1
"Project Manager: Maybe for the DVD pla player or something,",0
"Project Manager: Alright, thank you very much.",1
Industrial Designer: Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction.,1
"Marketing: Yeah, I think whiteboard is useful.",1
"Industrial Designer: It is useful, in conceptualizing, in being creative.",1
"Industrial Designer: I think you can if you have a scale, so.",0
"User Interface: And then here you'd have your sort of standard, telephonish number pad.",1
Project Manager: It wo not does not Maybe we should start with the technical functions.,1
Project Manager: The scroll wheel is on the side.,1
Marketing: you are I mean you are Project Manager.,0
Industrial Designer: so I was thinking maybe instead of doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be.,1
"Project Manager: Button supplements, they will be in a special colour of black.",0
"Project Manager: Yeah, I was just kinda going by the web page, 'cause they did not give me any clear, like yellow, grey, or.",0
Industrial Designer: when you throw with titanium with your remote control.,0
"Project Manager: Except for the yellow of course,",1
Marketing: That they only use ten percent the buttons.,0
Marketing: Simple is beautiful.,1
"Project Manager: Then then you better do not yeah, d.",0
"User Interface: Then they are small cute, furry, when planet of the apes becomes real, I'm gonna be up there with them.",0
"Industrial Designer: The buttons should also be not too small, not too big, of course,",1
Marketing: So it would need twelve buttons.,1
Marketing: It is a field programmable gateway arrays.,0
"Marketing: So does this I think lik information was a bit low I think, sometimes,",0
Project Manager: that people might want it as in addition to their existing remote controls.,0
"Industrial Designer: And possibly the thing about the about the remote being lost we could have You know with your mobile phone, you lose that, you can ring it.",1
Marketing: My name is Freek Van Ponnen.,1
"Marketing: Right, they said they wanted voice recognition.",0
"Industrial Designer: It can be a bit, yeah, overwhelming.",1
"User Interface: Actually when you are watching the TV, when you are watching anything or listening to them, you hardly care about what is getting displayed here,",1
"Project Manager: It should have nine channel buttons, a next button, vole buttons, subtitle buttons, switch to control features, colour contrast, sharpness etcetera.",1
"Project Manager: if our primary consideration is to get it there in time, time is short,",0
"Marketing: it is more about the protecting the LCD, which I think is where it came from.",1
"User Interface: I already wrote some down, some ideas.",1
Project Manager: I have now got evaluation criteria.,0
Project Manager: I think it was a good collaboration.,0
"Marketing: Well, we, I have thinked a few evaluation criterias, based on our marketing strategy, on the latest trends, on user preferences.",1
Project Manager: You are the Marketing Expert.,0
"User Interface: No, because you see now all the TV programmes are available on the webs.",0
Industrial Designer: You take one? What do you give it?,0
"Marketing: yeah, frustrations of like people losing remote control.",1
"Marketing: so few buttons for main things,",0
"Industrial Designer: or there is solar power, which we have been considering inside a building, which is where it is gonna be used, might not be quite so useful.",1
"Industrial Designer: And, course I never wanna replace the battery.",1
"Marketing: Ja precies, ja precies, ja precies.",0
"Project Manager: So like a normal cheap plastic case which can be covered up in, for instance, a wooden case.",1
"Project Manager: Quite how the best way to do this is, I'm not sure,",1
"Project Manager: Is that all? And anyone who has not put their presentation in the project documents folder, it would be good just so in case we have to refer to it.",1
Project Manager: How c more creative can you get?,0
"Industrial Designer: and yeah, just a no, one reg v.",0
User Interface: The green are the channel changing.,1
"Project Manager: so we can start today to have a first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control, any idea? So, if you have some experience, good or bad, with remote controls you can share it, say what you f what is your idea.",1
"Industrial Designer: And after a while they start to develop some skills in the voice recognition functions, then they will not use this dial as often.",0
"Marketing: Well I'd say shop around but with our time constraints, is that really a feasible option?",0
"Marketing: It should only cost twelve, a half Euros, of course.",0
Marketing: I do not say it is specially I do not say it is special.,0
"Marketing: And a trendy look, well, although seventy percent of the market is consists of elderly people who do not really care for trendy looks or whatever, I guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, but it is th I thought would, that would be the same.",0
"Project Manager: We are talking about the project plan, we are going to discuss about st our first ideas, so on, yeah.",1
Project Manager: And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach.,1
"Marketing: So fancy, technologically innovative, easy to use, trendy, buttons, excess buttons, good buttons, ugly, sellable, other.",1
Marketing: I'm the Marketing Expert.,1
"User Interface: It is hard to decide for us, but yeah.",0
"Project Manager: The ID is going to do the look, feel design, the UID the user interface design.",1
"User Interface: So if you have a universal TV controller, you needed one button that has two stripes.",1
Project Manager: let is go to lunch.,0
"Marketing: Focusing on their desires, people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly, seventy five per cent of the a hundred subjects noted that, that they more importantly though, eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote.",1
"User Interface: Yeah, they are less important, but I think they should be there,",1
Project Manager: And what makes it very expensive is for example the solar cell.,0
"User Interface: We seem to have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad, but when you look, technically, at how it works, sometimes that is not the case.",1
"User Interface: So depending on what we want our functionality to be, the chip could be expensive or it could be cheap.",1
Marketing: The meeting is over at least.,0
Industrial Designer: Your usually your remote sits on that.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, I think we will go for a single curve, no?",1
Marketing: Which is not very userfriendly though.,0
"Project Manager: But if you put it on the on the flip, then technical I do not think it is feasible, 'cause most of the time you speak then it will be recognised.",1
"Industrial Designer: And then you have on the sides to make it a little bit more threedimensional, you have your channel changing, volume changing buttons, your menu button right here in the middle.",1
Marketing: So what mark should we give for that?,0
Project Manager: I think we might have to drop the voice rec.,1
"Project Manager: The next phase, Sebastian, is the design of the look, feel.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, that is the one.",0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah it is f kind of fun, it was.",0
Industrial Designer: th So you are the marketing.,0
Marketing: On our corporate site I saw a new DVD player we are gonna produce.,0
"Industrial Designer: what we could use is, or what I was offered, or what we could use, is a basic bateer battery.",1
"User Interface: I guess you could build that in, you could you could link the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on the remote control.",1
"Marketing: We see it in mobile phones a lot, tha that is where we have borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from.",1
"User Interface: Well maybe it can have two shells, a hard shell inside, a spongy shell outside.",1
"Industrial Designer: because a lotta you can make a very sensitive microphone, so it makes it possible to just put it arou underneath it or on the on the bottom of the remote.",1
"Industrial Designer: so everybody i including our grandmothers can use it,",1
Marketing: the LCD touch screen is feature.,1
User Interface: So these are just a few ideas.,0
"Industrial Designer: And these were the findings which I saw with the web, that user wants to have control more than one device wants to control more than one device from the same remote control, so our TV remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like VCR DVD players which are usually attached with the TV, because users are like this, they do not want to have one remote control for everything, so with this additional little, we might be having slightly better market for us.",1
"Marketing: Yeah, interesting thing about discussing production of a remote control for me is that l as you point out, I just do not think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits.",0
User Interface: Now the most important feature I would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature.,1
"Project Manager: So then we have sample sensor, sample speaker, then we have the wood material, then special colour, push button.",0
"Project Manager: We need to have the the user function the functions decided, our target audience.",0
"Marketing: People want it to be that, but s still they care more about the way it looks than what it does.",1
"User Interface: You say programme start, then type in.",1
Project Manager: How do you call that?,0
Marketing: So an interesting element was the would you pay more for speech recognition question.,0
"Project Manager: Ju just make two designs,",1
Project Manager: See what our roles are in this project.,1
"Marketing: Good leadership, I think we stayed on task.",1
"User Interface: Vole up, down.",0
User Interface: And what is interesting is the icons on the buttons.,0
User Interface: Do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff?,0
Project Manager: You can see them there.,0
Project Manager: After that we have thirty minutes of individual work.,1
"User Interface: Yeah, the sound signal.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, but they are built in, so it is one.",1
Project Manager: we just talked about it looks.,1
"Marketing: I do not know what that creates cost, or.",0
Marketing: They liked square shapes with round edges.,1
"Marketing: Like I see lots of websites, things that seem to associate with like lemon, lime,",0
Marketing: Or I dunno if you could have a battery pack.,1
"Project Manager: we have certain decisions to make, we have forty minutes total.",0
Project Manager: well we have got five minutes before the end of the meeting.,0
User Interface: It seems to be falling over.,0
"Industrial Designer: And then, it will say hi.",0
"Marketing: the speech recognition is a very good innovation I believe it,",0
"Industrial Designer: And the materials? I have heard several things, so I I will have to change that on the way.",0
Project Manager: we have got more like fifty.,0
"User Interface: They look like they did when I was in elementary school,",0
User Interface: I would say thirty five to forty.,1
Project Manager: Alright so so we are going to go through three of your individual presentations.,1
Project Manager: Only be used for television.,1
Project Manager: So possibly it might be worth the investment.,1
Marketing: You wanna have both options.,1
"Marketing: Yeah, if you want to adjust, like for example, adjust the audio settings, you press audio on the touchscreen.",0
Industrial Designer: What do we think a good size would be for this?,0
Project Manager: I think it So One second.,0
"User Interface: we also found that there is inconsistent layout, which makes it confusing.",1
"Industrial Designer: Well, if the button was actually on.",0
Project Manager: So this is out of discussion.,1
"User Interface: Yeah well, 'cause I mean it is so hard to describe what you mean just with words, pointing at photographs, saying, well we quite want this, but imagine it rounder.",1
Marketing: No it is It would still write.,0
"Marketing: If we'd had that sheet at the beginning should have been like, so we can have that lot, let is just throw it together, do what we can.",1
User Interface: Cause you will have to like.,0
Industrial Designer: The chip on print? you gotta f Yeah.,1
"Project Manager: Can you go back one page? For the menu, what do we use for that? We do not have buttons for the menu.",0
Project Manager: I do not know.,0
Marketing: And they had a lot of findings in their report with statistical thing with statistical proof.,0
"Industrial Designer: maybe a special colour for the buttons, so maybe four again.",0
Project Manager: Where did you go to uni Nathan?,0
"Project Manager: my gosh, this is disastrous.",0
"Project Manager: I guess, we are gonna discuss the project financing later, making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget.",0
Project Manager: j just get jaw ache.,0
Project Manager: we are down to the prototype presentation.,0
"Project Manager: some of the oje objectives are that is has to be original, trendy, userfriendly.",1
"Industrial Designer: So, this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab, you can shake it if it is out of power.",1
Project Manager: so that is it I think about the concepts.,0
Project Manager: Should stay in the square here.,0
"Marketing: But I mean the yell yeah d yellow is ugly though,",0
"Project Manager: Yeah, maybe you have you have to when you use teletec teletext, you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one, or to go to the previous one.",1
Industrial Designer: And we wanna go for simplicity.,1
Project Manager: The LEDs can be surprisingly bright now.,0
"Marketing: She uses it to make phone calls, that is it.",0
"Industrial Designer: And if we want something fancier, I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice,",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, that is not a cheap thing to get.",0
"Industrial Designer: They are trying to ship the DVD player, the video player, the TV.",0
"Project Manager: Let is see what I think this should these are always on top of the of the control, so they should be here.",0
Project Manager: Do you have anything to say?,0
"Industrial Designer: We could use a basic battery, but that brings with it, like they need to be recharged, the bulk, the size of it as well.",1
"Marketing: now that is, I, I dunno exactly what exactly we'd put on there.",0
Project Manager: Next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes.,0
"Marketing: And we are still not then we do not have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either,",0
"Project Manager: And then we can we can still use the voice recognition, but maybe then for only the channels.",1
"Industrial Designer: As stable as it is, there must be a compromise between stability, design here, so.",0
"User Interface: we I know something, we need more cakes, more biscuits on the table while we have meetings.",0
"Marketing: And the third point there in this order if of importance, the third point, is a high ease of use.",1
Marketing: I do not need a SMARTboard.,0
"User Interface: So I keep in touch with the R, D department.",0
"User Interface: Yeah, if we build rocket ships why ca not we build lefthanded, righthanded remotes.",0
"Marketing: because whatever companies they launch their products in the shape of fruits, they give a range of products, a range of shapes, like if we see, look at the smallest thing, toffee chocolates, they give a variety of different things.",1
"User Interface: if we implement speech recognition, I think it would be better to implement LCD as well.",1
Project Manager: Do not looks nice.,0
Project Manager: And well it should work I have read it from my from some colleague that it should work with some kind of toolbar.,0
"User Interface: Of course mobile phones do tend to be more expensive,",1
Industrial Designer: The docking station is a is a little bit innovative.,1
User Interface: I wonder if it bounces when you drop it.,0
"Industrial Designer: And the And the second one is really state of the art, in terms of innovation.",0
"User Interface: I took the ideas that we were talking about last time tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch, volume, channel control, the menu access button, ergonomic shape, which I completely agree with Christine is idea to have it sort of molded, so it is slightly more ergonomic, comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls.",1
User Interface: Specially the R.,0
"Marketing: we would not say, I mean, those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me.",1
Marketing: And then lastly I thought that maybe we could discuss the idea of speech recognition.,1
Industrial Designer: They cannot work with doublecurved.,0
Marketing: And also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls.,1
User Interface: But I presume this is t I presume this is just for television.,1
User Interface: Yeah i so if do not buy now they can buy in the future.,0
"Marketing: And actually to go with that, I'm gonna give you some statistics on the relevancy of the buttons, how much they are used.",1
User Interface: I mean I have never bought a remote.,0
"Project Manager: so we will work up from there, then we will meet on, talk about it, then finally we will incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me tell us what is possible, then you tell us what we can hope for, what way to go take the take the basics, make it nicer, then ov obviously the UID, the ID you know you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible to try t of sync it all up.",0
Marketing: And I think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use.,1
"Marketing: but If you put your normal remote control under your bed, or you throw this remote control under your bed, is it better findable?",1
"Marketing: According to your distance to the angle maybe, if you have a stereo system.",1
"Industrial Designer: So, I in addition to looking at the the functional requir so all these devices are examples of where they represent examples that are available today which I think the one in the middle is r really something to keep in mind.",0
"Industrial Designer: So I'm guessing that the sample speaker is probably something like you know, as soon as you press a button, it give gives you feedback, one five or whatever.",1
Marketing: you said company colour yellow.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, special co but we took into consideration the fact that it is customisable.",0
Project Manager: Before we went on to the to the whole design.,1
"Marketing: I mean, they have got all these sort of, you know, high definition DVD, portable seven inch d lightweight computer screens,",0
User Interface: And then the other one is the power.,1
"Industrial Designer: wi with a button to retrieve it, so it will beep.",0
Industrial Designer: and because we ca not really say user to say same wording.,0
"Project Manager: Effort is three, ten, twelve.",1
"Project Manager: Ah yeah, just make it we will make it a two.",1
Project Manager: But you give the input.,0
Industrial Designer: Because we kind of tried to but we kind of failed with the budget that we have.,1
"Marketing: However, because the voice recognition software exists already, there is no need to spend money on research, development, but this does mean the need for microphones in the in the remote control, which is an unusual feature in my opinion.",1
"User Interface: Yeah, like they have for mobile phones.",0
"Project Manager: Which are most likely to be found somewhere in the house, you know.",0
Industrial Designer: The easy volume up button.,0
"Project Manager: and the time to market will be too big, if we wanna have it for more functions.",0
"Industrial Designer: It is a specially ugly colour, but it is not special.",0
Project Manager: If you make this Looks a bit like a cross.,0
Project Manager: you can draw on the board using this pen.,1
"User Interface: are not the features the microphone is feature, that you can change the channel is feature, that you can change the volume is feature,",0
"Project Manager: And in fact the way they have got that there even if you had that on a white, which is the predominant colour of the the Windows badge, you'd still be able to see it clearly from you know a white casing product.",0
User Interface: There were two for one big button.,0
"Industrial Designer: W when we had the wheely remote control, we it was on the top I think, if you held it like that.",1
"Project Manager: well let is go ahead,",0
Project Manager: The length is gonna be difficu.,0
"Project Manager: And UID, the technical fun functions design,",1
"User Interface: But Yeah, but the infrared, it is, well, a little bit oldfashioned, if you would call it like that.",1
"User Interface: So, make a click, please.",0
Marketing: So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other.,1
Marketing: So we have five minutes left.,0
"User Interface: And it would be easier to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices rather than other ent,",0
"Marketing: So the first one is, does the product look, feel fancy.",0
"Industrial Designer: I dunno, that might contribute to less people losing it too if it it stays in one place.",1
"Industrial Designer: we are n using kinetic, yeah.",0
"Marketing: so that is where we started, we used our usability lab, the company is usability lab, we did our usual selection methods to get a crosssection of the general public, male, female, all age groups from fifteen upwards, we observed them in the lab, just their general use of the remote control, you can see we had a hundred subjects there.",1
Marketing: but I would say there is more too much red.,1
Marketing: The first item.,1
Marketing: which you can recharge through the docking station.,1
"Industrial Designer: but of course, since it is a ball, it will roll, so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least, down here somewhere,",1
"Marketing: we gonna do the evaluation now, together.",1
"User Interface: The other key feature that that would be a good idea built into it is t is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic, something that just fits fits as comfortably as possible into the hand.",1
"Industrial Designer: which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value,",1
"Industrial Designer: I it is reasonable, s quite yeah.",0
Project Manager: Mael can you hand me over this?,0
"Marketing: But we will have to also avoid, you know, buttons responding to the slightest touch as well.",1
"Project Manager: Would we be the company that would break down these, or metals? Or would we contribute to another group?",1
User Interface: Ev everybody w was agreeing every.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, even harder to draw like this than black board style.",0
Project Manager: So it is yellow.,0
"User Interface: If you reuse the existing screen, we element eliminate the LCD, after all the LCD just to display.",1
"User Interface: Yeah, so we have to bake the ba back flat, then.",1
"Project Manager: Just before you start, to make it easier, would you three mind emailing me your presentations? Once we you do not have to do it now but when once you go back,",1
Project Manager: What do we scrap.,1
Project Manager: Do you think these pens can give you cancer of the hand?,0
Industrial Designer: I think we do not have that in our budget.,0
"Project Manager: You know, the battery will last know, five, ten years.",0
"User Interface: Yeah, but at the same time I think maybe we can we can just decide to have both of these groups as our target,",0
User Interface: There was a lot of synergy.,0
"User Interface: I think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy, I'd say maybe aesthetic.",1
"Project Manager: due to the fact that we have gone for such a nice, easy minimal design, normally.",0
Marketing: But it not really going very convenient.,1
"Marketing: Yeah, but only if they zap a lot, they watch over five hours TV or something.",1
"Project Manager: No, there is no painting, only yellow or But it is into the rubber.",0
Marketing: So the only option is an hand dynamo.,1
"User Interface: yeah, more trendier design, I think.",0
Project Manager: We have to have a look what they are.,1
User Interface: A metallicy finish we were thinking.,0
Industrial Designer: I figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually.,0
Marketing: Now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control.,1
"Project Manager: And so we have to, come up with a way to, to create a, a remote control, where we can like the price to create it will be significantly less.",1
"User Interface: so the voice recognition would be just an extra, it would not really reduce the size of the remote.",0
Industrial Designer: That is maybe the cup holder.,0
Project Manager: I hated to draw like that.,0
"User Interface: It is not something it is no information I read about it or so, but it is just from.",0
"Industrial Designer: So I was of the idea that we can have two kind of power supplies, one is the usual batteries which are there, they could be chargeable batteries if there is a basis station kind of thing, on top of that we can have solar cells, when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so it will be pretty innovative kind.",1
"Project Manager: I'm from Melbourne, I'm your Project Manager for today.",0
"User Interface: Or you could use this one, but I do not know if it is very comfortable, to use this one for the wheel.",0
Industrial Designer: I will put delay to allow multiple nbers.,0
"Marketing: I just know that I was identified as a we identified ourselves as as a developer, as a manufacturer, as as a distributor t to other wholesalers.",1
"Industrial Designer: You lose this one, you got eleven point five.",1
Project Manager: So wha what What wha what what document.,0
Marketing: I do not think that is really appropriate.,0
"User Interface: This button is like the mouse is like a joystick,",1
"User Interface: And one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use, so I think I'm not sure about the LCD.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, but just do some We.",0
Project Manager: Good morning everybody.,1
Marketing: But you have at least next produce.,0
Marketing: I would also say three.,0
Project Manager: something like that should reduce the size of it.,1
"Industrial Designer: I did not get a chance to complete this one, 'cause some of the tools that I was given were frustrating.",1
"Marketing: because they are critical, they want to have a fancy remote control.",0
"Marketing: most irrelevant, less used were audio settings, mono, stereo, pitch, bass.",0
"Industrial Designer: So, all the individual components could be easily separated, then some could be reused, some could be recycled, I think that would be very important for products now.",1
Marketing: But that was an overall point.,0
User Interface: We have to decide on that.,1
Industrial Designer: So maybe we can put that on the bottom.,1
"Marketing: Yeah, I do not know.",0
Project Manager: All of the components have been used in other things before.,1
Marketing: You Do you think you are gonna be able to do that with ti titanium as well?,0
"Project Manager: so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on, off, channel changing, volume, another rote remote with all the special things.",1
"Industrial Designer: Well I also have several examples of styles,",0
"Industrial Designer: If we w if we use only just one small penlight, then it will be cheaper than when we use two.",1
Industrial Designer: so it'd be kinda good to have them be feel completely different.,1
"Marketing: And in fact I hope that you all introduce some additional terms, because these are things that have been brought up, some of them seem rather close,",1
Project Manager: Do much apart from having a huge big.,0
Project Manager: another point is the LCD screen.,1
"Industrial Designer: And the case, yeah we already discussed the case,",1
"Project Manager: The next meeting starts in thirty minutes, although does it? It starts at three twenty one, the next meeting.",1
Industrial Designer: so we should keep this button.,1
Industrial Designer: Not sure how.,0
Project Manager: You all have to be paid.,0
Project Manager: You could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things.,0
"User Interface: They gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question, you program the answer, the machine responds accordingly.",1
Marketing: for the speech recognition you do not need anything.,0
"Project Manager: I think we should go for universal,",1
User Interface: Especially if we are selling into the US market becasue there is a lot of Spanish speakers there.,0
"Project Manager: the one before, the third meeting.",0
"Project Manager: Again, you will have to argue with the accountants on that one.",0
"Marketing: Third on the list, again innovative was twice as important as this last aspect, it has to be easy to use.",1
Marketing: So we have this.,0
"Project Manager: s y yeah but you can programme, so you can programme like your favourite channels, so like if you had a s.",1
"Project Manager: The quest the question to be addressed here is only who is the target group, how will it function,",0
Project Manager: So perhaps the joystick the keyboard idea might work better.,0
"Marketing: do not worry it is all said, I was just gonna say yeah, are we gonna make this as part of like a part of the f like it the fashions apply to furniture, so are we gonna make this part of the furniture?",1
Project Manager: so does anybody have anything they wanna say before we close the meeting?,0
Project Manager: So keep keep detailed functions hidden at the back.,0
"Industrial Designer: so no problem in energy, I think.",1
"Industrial Designer: personally I think we should infra use infrared, because otherwise our device cannot communicate with almost every TV set.",1
Project Manager: Something we could use with one hand.,1
"User Interface: There are remote controls like that, yeah.",0
"Marketing: for technologically innovative, we have talked about the tracking device.",0
Project Manager: Because you ne almost never use it.,1
"User Interface: and it is it is interesting, basically storing the channel through voice or other ways of programming your keys, on the display for the browsing.",0
Marketing: and we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that.,0
Project Manager: You are all get you are all getting a raise.,0
"Project Manager: and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself, made out of rubber.",1
"Project Manager: the project has been evaluated well, truly.",0
Project Manager: And it is a function we do not need in our remote control.,0
"Project Manager: You what if may be a little fancy but what if it had like a little screen, so it has less buttons but it still has all the functions.",1
"Marketing: So, things change all the time, every year you know they always talk about this year, this is the new black.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, I woulda said two would seem reasonable.",0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, we have some child lock or something, yeah.",0
"Project Manager: we can we will have to work fast, alright as you can see we have got thirty minutes until the next meeting, so we will have to try, decide on some of the basic functionality, how the user interface might work, that will be a key aspect especially if the idea of some kind of macros facility because you have to program it, you have to have a lot of response back, or at least some kind.",1
"Industrial Designer: You have the buttons, the case itself, the rubber, th.",0
"Industrial Designer: I think it will be a little more difficult, but not too much.",1
Marketing: From the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more.,1
Marketing: I guess no.,0
"User Interface: and you can use your time, it will take i some days to learn all this buttons, the LCD is going to be somewhere here, go back button, I do not know really where it is, maybe one of this buttons, power on, off I do not remember.",1
"User Interface: yeah if you are if you are z zapping with your yeah remote control, you can press the menu button, then you are suddenly into the yeah the display.",0
"Industrial Designer: An energy source feeds an integrated circuit, like a chip, that can compose messages.",1
User Interface: Room for creativity.,1
"User Interface: I really think we need to not only possibly even materials, like the type of plastic used, but everything including size, shape of buttons, positioning of buttons, the actual shape of the handheld device, colours, just every e yeah, everything to do with this has to be revolutionised.",1
"Marketing: Thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control, they want something that is easier to use straight away, more intuitive perhaps.",1
"Project Manager: So as we all agree to accept, under certain conditions, the prototype, we will have look to the final sh financial view.",0
"Project Manager: well just just for the next meeting,",1
Project Manager: But I'm not the authority to say that it is.,0
"Marketing: And with the little screen in it, which explains the buttons.",1
"Project Manager: according to Ruud, the market likes new flashy technology,",1
"Marketing: you know, people want something new, something technologically innovative, different, so the whole idea with the LCDs, the spinning, the colours, the voice recognition is quite like, quite the thing to go for.",1
Project Manager: so I think that is one group that is certainly important.,0
"Industrial Designer: s I guess we decided on material, right? So that spongy latex rubber everything feel,",1
Industrial Designer: and this is the chip that I was talking about last time.,1
Marketing: my personal preferences.,1
"Marketing: what would you say, we gotta give points to to all of these to evaluate that design, please forget the drawing skills of these guys.",0
User Interface: That way we could upgrade later.,0
User Interface: Can you just make it two? The first.,0
"Marketing: I would say the s the s the spinning goes at a high speed to th to the scrolling wheel,",1
Industrial Designer: If you hear some click.,0
Project Manager: First the functional design.,1
"User Interface: is that you then basically you can then basically put it I mean for T for TV remote alone, you could put I mean there are like I say the main things people do with a TV remote control is the vole, the channel.",0
"Marketing: Everyone has a TV remote, but then we add in the fact that they could each have their own individual fruit.",1
Project Manager: the two of you get to play with a Pla modelling clay to do a prototype.,0
"Marketing: overall we are getting two something, but we can round it as two.",0
"User Interface: I hope you do not like snakes, do you?",0
"User Interface: But And part of the thing is m a lot of people say that they do not like something that is too light, because they do not feel like they have enough control over it.",0
"Industrial Designer: If you go on to f findings, it is like two or three slides down.",0
"Marketing: So that is fairly fairly good, I think.",0
"Industrial Designer: One, the LC display.",0
Marketing: With some l with some layers in it.,0
Project Manager: Yeah I got another point.,1
User Interface: No you press the plus first.,0
"Marketing: my point is, well, I If we ma make a remote control for only television, I think it is hard to sell it for twenty five Euros.",1
Marketing: I like those printer cables that just have the two little butterfly clips like that.,0
User Interface: so the following are a bunch of different interface concepts.,0
"Industrial Designer: and then by the time I got to the last one I was like, you know, not very much.",1
Project Manager: I would say seven.,1
Marketing: But we ca not drop three buttons.,0
"Project Manager: Sarah, you presented a marketing research report which pretty much rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds it has to be handheld, power, channel, vole, nber keys, possibly a speech recognition.",1
"User Interface: just leave it, it is fine.",0
Industrial Designer: Did not we?,0
"User Interface: we have to decide on our user interface, which is his department, but the in user interface is also a major component.",1
"Project Manager: yeah, but you have an international market range, so you have I think a big range of.",0
"Industrial Designer: You think? And you could you could sell oils with it, to take care of it.",0
"Marketing: Right, the rem The remote control has recognisable corporate image, colour, logo or slogan.",1
Project Manager: I think you did an awesome job.,1
"Project Manager: The what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two, so you can show us what you have been working on so diligently.",1
"Project Manager: I think i Ruud, do you have any anything you would like to add or maybe thoughts or.",0
User Interface: Yeah well if we we have to get cheaper.,0
"Marketing: And the older people spend more money, easily on a remote control.",1
"User Interface: You would though, 'cause it is bit it is more interesting than other remotes.",0
Industrial Designer: it did not The voice recognition came as a separate piece of information.,1
"Project Manager: or solar that you'd have difficulty with it if it is a dark day, that it will die on you, no way to do it.",0
"User Interface: but also something that was gonna jp out at people, something that would be different, separate it from the other remotes out on the market.",0
Marketing: But how we we are gonna make many of those.,0
Marketing: Technology technical technologically innovative.,1
"Marketing: We are gon let is use elegant, although the people, the word on the street is.",0
Industrial Designer: But it is you have the lemon aspect of this th this this thing.,0
"User Interface: I'm just wondering actually, 'cause, you know, I this whole fruit thing with the banana, it is it seemed like it first seems a bit kind of niche, like only a few people would really want a banana,",1
"Project Manager: And we have therefore we have to do the final questionnaire, do the meeting summary, I have a final report to present, then we are done.",1
Project Manager: And repeat that process three times.,1
Marketing: So we will see whether this product meets all user requirements or not.,0
"User Interface: That is not a mousey, no.",1
"Project Manager: No, you do not.",0
Industrial Designer: So a spongy banana re.,0
User Interface: Here I present another version without the LCD.,1
"Project Manager: Yeah, well maybe that would make it even more easy to use for them.",1
"User Interface: Some of them are gonna be kinda slow switching, so you may like queue up like fifteen channel changes, it will be like flip, flip, flip.",1
"Industrial Designer: And there is not d it does not open up to the advanced functions? the advanced functions are still hidden from you, but they are hidden in the sense that they are not in use.",1
Project Manager: And then you can keep the curve.,1
"Industrial Designer: The colour, is the colour acceptable?",0
Marketing: which we have already probably discussed.,0
"Project Manager: See, it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning.",1
Marketing: It should have been two questions.,1
Industrial Designer: Yeah if you want.,0
Marketing: Important issues about the remote.,0
User Interface: But I mean the older so.,0
"Industrial Designer: Well I think both are really easy to use because there are few button buttons,",0
Project Manager: You could have different kind of casings.,1
Marketing: So that takes it down to thirteen Euros without the speech recognition.,1
"Marketing: and therefore we need to go for that if we want, you know, wh whatever our motto is.",0
"Industrial Designer: Well, I th I think you two, especially you, Daniel, you d you both had the less creative roles in the project.",1
Marketing: They are not really very interested in features.,1
Project Manager: Course that will then remove some of our ball.,0
"Project Manager: S so we can try to go in between,",1
"Marketing: LCD screen is easy because we have the LCD screen, we have the various options.",1
"Project Manager: I think to keep in mind, but not really for now is that they want the slogan, the, the logo to to be recognised more in the remote.",1
Industrial Designer: Are you happy with that?,0
Marketing: and the old people like plain wood.,1
Industrial Designer: but this is how the basic system works.,0
"Marketing: Yeah, but at the moment teletext is Yeah, th the best thing you can get on TV, like getting information.",1
Project Manager: Well we have to have buttons on it too as well.,1
Industrial Designer: We can we can make its I think.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, they have that little solar.",0
Project Manager: That is prototype.,0
Industrial Designer: So that is basically the total design of this piece of equipment.,0
Marketing: so we have six points.,0
"Marketing: yeah, there is lot there is lots of pretty mobile phones, not too many pretty remote controls.",0
Project Manager: Well we could make a compromise between that.,1
Marketing: So these this is the smary of everything.,0
"Project Manager: but it is getting used less, less.",0
Project Manager: They do not need special colours.,0
"Project Manager: Alright, so it might be very appealing if, we have very concise buttons.",1
User Interface: Why ca not I see the crazy.,0
"Project Manager: so that elderly people can use the remote control, at the same time look easily at the screen, because it is a bit, it has a bit of a angle.",0
"Marketing: well, I can send it to all of you.",0
Project Manager: We have to choose one.,1
"Project Manager: Maybe the holder, if we were to have a holder, it could be shaped like a fruit.",0
Industrial Designer: Y you may get the idea.,0
"Marketing: I think if we have an LCD, it will also sell a lot better.",1
User Interface: Well I think we do.,0
"Project Manager: It is something that we are supposed to sell for about twenty five Euros, you know, goals for profits are I think somewhere around fifty million Euros, what they wanna make on it, so.",1
Project Manager: It does not get lost easily.,1
Project Manager: making a profit of fifty million Euros.,1
User Interface: So I can take I think mine now there.,0
Marketing: and that they want spongy material.,1
"Project Manager: So, that brings us to the project evaluation.",1
User Interface: It is not on my screen.,0
"Industrial Designer: So to answer that honestly I would rather say like, we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly, definitely.",1
"Industrial Designer: so for the casing, this an email I got from our manufacturing team, you know, we have a bunch of options from wood, titani, rubber, plastic, whatnot, latex, doublecurved, curved.",1
"User Interface: basically which is what we d do in computer, have icons or touch pad or whatever,",1
"Industrial Designer: it is fundament well I mean I guess it it is something we have discussed since the sort of the beginning, so I th I think in our in our minds it is fundamental, but I do not know that the the upper echelons of the company would necessarily agree with that, so I think you have to.",0
Industrial Designer: But we th that should be design.,1
"User Interface: Yes, you need options to configure it, after that you do not need 'em anymore.",1
"Project Manager: like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones, yeah.",1
"User Interface: Let is try, think now, how much would you pay for.",0
"User Interface: I think my favourite animal would be a dog, but I'm not really sure how to draw one.",1
"Project Manager: it might be trendy to some, but I'm just not swallowing the fruit, so.",1
"Industrial Designer: then we could possibly have the scroll, the push, but no LCD, 'cause we probably ca not afford that one.",0
"User Interface: You could you could change the colours, that was also the idea.",1
"Marketing: So if we make a trendy design, we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market, which you can reach.",1
"User Interface: And the pla And a plastic b just plastic buttons, a plas instead of rubber.",1
"Project Manager: But maybe you can try to make a screen shot of this, so I can try to include it in the final report.",1
Marketing: But you can have an button for child lock.,1
"Marketing: The idea is simple, but with a display, so you can see what you are doing.",0
"Project Manager: Yeah, but we going to yeah, that is true.",0
Marketing: That is everything from me.,0
"Marketing: But my question is, I mean the stereotypically speaking, you kind of picture males with their remote controls, I'm not sure how they'd feel about having fruity logos on the outside.",0
Industrial Designer: And they are possible.,0
"Project Manager: And then we will evaluate it, given the criteria that that we gave it.",1
Project Manager: We have to stop it now.,1
"Project Manager: And friendly, so size does matter.",1
"Industrial Designer: well, not to implement it, but to well, to find a way to add to add this functionality in a yeah, in an in an easy manner, if is possible.",1
"Project Manager: we want it to be something original, something trendy, also something user friendly, so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product.",1
"Industrial Designer: Like your zap zapping device is just u channels updown, volume, onoff.",1
Project Manager: grand total of twenty five minutes we have here.,0
"User Interface: They wanted something that looks fancy, I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a too much of a gimmick, but something ergonomically shaped, organic, like good to hold, based on fruits, natural things like that,",1
Industrial Designer: How am I gonna do this?.,0
Marketing: And if you are a French guy watching an English movie you would like to have it in French.,0
User Interface: So there are several key features of our pr prototype.,1
"Industrial Designer: And the reason why teletext is outdated because of internet, the availability of internet over television.",0
User Interface: So I just got an email saying that.,0
User Interface: Yeah it is sorta like a joystick.,0
"Marketing: Obviously, we ca not make a remote into a computer, but maybe simple commands.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah keep it optional 'cause maybe you can you know go left to right, up, down in a in one menu.",0
"Project Manager: It'd be more a command interface, then.",1
Industrial Designer: Because you n almost never use menu button.,1
"Industrial Designer: That is yeah, is that.",0
"Industrial Designer: You leave it lying around, you first have to shake it before it starts to work.",0
Project Manager: Do you want to yeah.,0
User Interface: But I'm thinking I'm thinking kind of PDA design.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, there are some that they did not mention, because recharge is not on the list.",1
Marketing: Or with the volume selection.,0
"User Interface: so the The icons on the arrows, as well, you mean.",1
"Marketing: Kind of looks like a penguin, like with no eye.",1
Marketing: Eighty per cents of users would spend more money when the remote control would look fancy.,0
"Marketing: Yeah, yeah, some of them.",0
Industrial Designer: Be like a copper hinge or you know.,1
Marketing: Yes well fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost.,1
Project Manager: Especially since Kate asked to be last.,0
"User Interface: But in electronics, I think, it is not q always quite so you do not always have so many choices as with chocolates.",1
Project Manager: So you were saying the scroll buttons.,0
Industrial Designer: And then you also can scroll scroll in it.,0
User Interface: I think we can improve on the design.,1
Project Manager: See you in thirty minutes.,1
"Project Manager: the more complex we make it of course, the more expensive.",1
"Marketing: And if you have it li in the middle, your hand might be over it.",1
Project Manager: I think batteries sound good.,0
Project Manager: right well would not it.,0
"Industrial Designer: And the, the bells, whistles that we mentioned you know, they take more budgeting, more technical expenditure of effort.",1
Project Manager: it could still have the basic buttons on it.,1
"User Interface: I think we can get the quality materials then it should not influence the design principles too much, which you will see with my presentation.",0
Industrial Designer: I think that is not very.,0
"Project Manager: the new project requirements, first of all, we did not speak about it, but we should not support teletext in the remote, because our b board feels that teletext is out of date, internet is replacing teletext.",1
"Marketing: Well, so in terms of elegant, fancy.",1
"Marketing: you'd mentioned I was just gonna say, could you reiterate the new project requirements,",1
Project Manager: I'm gonna let you guys talk before we make decisions.,1
"User Interface: Yeah, that is what I was thinking as well.",1
"User Interface: Yeah, that you do not need a battery.",0
Marketing: Holding a remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero.,1
"Industrial Designer: A sign, yeah, just like, indeed.",0
"Marketing: How is that? w we had we do not have an manual,",0
"Industrial Designer: but we cannot add scroll wheels, we cannot add an LCD screen.",1
"Project Manager: 'Cause we have evaluated, we are within budget.",0
Project Manager: And also what you said.,1
Project Manager: but when you think you can give me like a kind of design on the functional design or the technical design?,0
Industrial Designer: we do not have any particular restrictions on that.,0
"Marketing: Looking for next generation of innovation, because all the remotes out there now, they are all very similar, they all do the same thing,",1
"User Interface: Yeah, maybe it is not easy if it is below.",0
"Marketing: So just by pressing the button with some code, you t you put a lock onto the remote, so that he ca not use even.",1
"Marketing: So you can use it maximum, because it is a lot it costs a lot.",0
Project Manager: So we are here for the detailed design meeting.,1
Project Manager: We all know each other is names.,0
User Interface: I have the mo mi I have a blinking light on my phone.,0
"Marketing: fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons, so again a big design issue there.",1
"Project Manager: but we do have to use the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour, our slogan, which is we put the fashion in electronics.",1
Marketing: that is the only that is the only drawback I see to this.,0
User Interface: Right from the start of the day.,0
"Industrial Designer: Do we will we use only two buttons, or like numbered buttons? I mean those nine plus one or two?",1
"Project Manager: So, see you in half an hour.",1
"Marketing: Like the amount of buttons,",1
Project Manager: then would it be one o'clock.,0
User Interface: And so I had a little less time to complete.,0
"Industrial Designer: You could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit, apple machine, they have like the blueberry, like all the colours are named after fruits.",1
Project Manager: I do not think that is an opportunity.,0
Industrial Designer: Why not a hand dynamo then?,0
"Marketing: the biggest user frustrations, as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere, so I think a tracking device of some sort would be a good idea.",1
"Project Manager: Alright, welcome back fro to the second meeting.",1
Marketing: so number one.,0
"Project Manager: but it well, imagine you are here you are with the ten people, everyone.",0
"User Interface: Maybe we could you were saying about solar power ma maybe not working indoors, but a lot of calculators, yeah, have solar power.",1
Marketing: I'm pretty sure people would buy it.,1
Project Manager: you ca not say record alias tonight at seven PM.,0
Project Manager: I thank you for this meeting.,0
"Industrial Designer: And what are just The bt buttons, we have twelve buttons, are you sure? Yeah.",1
"User Interface: touch screen interface, possibly having goto buttons being stuck into the system so those do not move away from the screen, the important ones like power, vole, jp between channels.",1
"Marketing: I dunno if you all remember from our kickoff meeting, we talked about our favourite animals.",1
"Project Manager: I think like speech recognit definitely they will agree, I do not think they will say no for that.",0
"Industrial Designer: so you would not be pressing down on 'em, w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is antiRSI.",1
Industrial Designer: Is she also our accountant?,0
"Marketing: for m for me the Marketing Expert, the user requirements specification, do I need to think as a user, as a only the looks, the.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, I have found that try, get it back.",0
"Project Manager: first I think energy it is a key problem because it depend what can we have as feature if we use only batteries, for example, or something like that.",1
Project Manager: And well then after some twenty five minutes I hope we can end this meeting.,0
Project Manager: The the voice sensor is expensive but we made a basic decision that was absolutely fundamental to the to the design so that has to stay.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, but it is more about the energy source, huh? Do you use a hand dynamo, a battery, kinetic or solar cells?",0
User Interface: so the concept of the interface.,1
"Project Manager: But if you want to download it to your computer, it is does not work.",1
"Project Manager: I got more master classes, anybody else wanna like take a master is class?",1
"Project Manager: Or maybe just stick 'em under a menu, like you said the the sound options, the surround, whatever, they are more complicated, just stick 'em under one menu, give it a just put it in s in a software piece, you can menu, you can select everything you want to set on your TV.",1
Project Manager: Yeah of g of course.,0
Marketing: But Maybe soft material or something.,1
"Marketing: Management Expert, you have to change that.",0
"Marketing: So the third being easy to use is probably a given, we have to try, incorporate, so.",0
"Industrial Designer: If you go for titani they can only do a standard box shape, whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more they can they can do sort of curved shapes.",1
Project Manager: Give me a good evaluation.,0
"Industrial Designer: That when you drop it, it wo not break.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah w we need very primary colours, like bright red, bright yellow.",1
"Marketing: If you do that, but I do not know if that is possible within the production cost of twelve, a half Euros.",1
Project Manager: So we will just have them standing there.,0
Industrial Designer: Yeah in my own in my own messenger.,0
User Interface: It does not necessarily replace the entire top.,0
"User Interface: You should able to feel the buttons without it mis you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons, so it should be as user interface for feeling should be good to understand.",0
Industrial Designer: but I think we have some technical problem or so.,1
Marketing: our market really likes really likes that.,0
"Project Manager: Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well,",1
Marketing: Do you want a chair maybe?,0
"Marketing: But only the numbers, one to twenty or something.",1
"Industrial Designer: it said it could talk to you, but it never said anything about being able to listen.",1
"Project Manager: Sarah, she is recommended that we go for simpler functions, so fewer functions but we need to decide who are we selling this to, you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted, thought about voice control,",1
"Project Manager: well, I do not want a full it is not necessary to have a full list, but I want the kind of functions, for example th the most important are vole, programme selecting.",0
Marketing: But then you are losing your fruity colours.,0
"Project Manager: you know like brightness, contrast?",0
Project Manager: Contains only the necessary buttons.,1
"Marketing: Alright, I will see you guys in a minute.",0
Industrial Designer: What what did you wanna say?,0
User Interface: So you need s special TV sets to do that? Or it is done via this remote controller? It is very complex.,0
"Industrial Designer: but in the dark it sort of, it is alive.",0
User Interface: I think we need not.,0
"Project Manager: then for Roo, as well important, the corporate image should be recognisable in our product.",1
Project Manager: And your role is?,0
Marketing: And next one was the size of the remote control.,1
Marketing: Should we think about how we are actually getting this hightech user friendly theme like what is it that we are u we are using to achieve those goals?,1
"Marketing: No, for the prototype.",0
"Industrial Designer: the p next, previous.",0
Industrial Designer: I think that is a three.,0
Marketing: A little upwards.,1
"Marketing: Well right away I'm wondering if there is th, like with DVD players, if there are zones.",1
Marketing: My handwriting is little bit yeah.,0
Marketing: It should be soft i it should feeling spongy or s Sponge Bob like things.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, example of crappy leadershi.",0
"Project Manager: But is it Does that break, a joystick? Or a small one just like in a laptop.",1
"Industrial Designer: It would be very new,",0
Project Manager: A graphical user interface emphasise the use of pictures.,1
Marketing: I'm pretty much against it.,0
"Marketing: From my point of view, yeah.",1
"Industrial Designer: Audio, we have like your basic y your base, your midrange, your high range.",1
"Industrial Designer: the buttons of course rubber, I think everyone agrees.",1
"Project Manager: If we can take it down to you know fifteen rather than twentyfive, make a low profitmargin on it,",0
"Project Manager: But, the DVD players, home cinema sets often double as stereo hifi sets probably.",0
Industrial Designer: and we got these large.,0
"Project Manager: I think it is, well, if the RR motto is, we bring fashion to electronics, I'd say that could be quite fashionable.",1
Project Manager: You all know I hope how it is about the new r remote control we are going to design.,0
"Project Manager: If everyone could do that as well, that'd be great.",1
"User Interface: And you might have a slight thing for to forward,",0
Industrial Designer: I will take this time just to apologise.,1
Marketing: Yeah so we should better choose one sh one shape.,0
"Marketing: W if you if you drop the cost, now if you make if you make go to the other side of the cost scale, you make it less expensive, then all of a sudden now we are going into an a new market area.",1
"User Interface: Put it in Project Documents,",0
User Interface: It is an integrated progra programmable sample sensor speaker unit.,0
"User Interface: Up, down, left, right.",0
"Industrial Designer: They are they are thin fibreglass with copper wires etched on to them, di I think they are quite easily printed on by machine, which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires, solders it all together for us.",1
"Project Manager: if you press if you press function, that again.",0
"User Interface: The channels buttons, one to nine, off zero to nine, the button to choose higher channels than nine.",1
Marketing: And our colour I think is great.,1
"Project Manager: Yeah, I mean you go on the location with your scroll wheel.",0
"User Interface: Even you h you have the controller, I can I can say channel three,",1
Industrial Designer: And whether we'd have a big enough market to have this kind of like secondary market of selling the cases might be something to consider.,0
Project Manager: Not quite sure what about.,1
Marketing: like a domed thing.,1
Marketing: that is so stupid.,0
User Interface: can I have the mouse?,0
Marketing: And the current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user.,1
Marketing: because it says below forty I mean.,0
Project Manager: I'm not sure if you are going to start right away to work together or I think you are going to fill in the questionnaires first.,0
"Industrial Designer: And so what I have found, after a lot of work actually I I draw this I draw for you this schema.",0
"User Interface: You can do a shipping centre somewhere, or strategically place shipping centres to minimise distance costs.",1
"User Interface: You think you ca not make a TV controller too small, 'cause then you will always lo always lose it.",1
Industrial Designer: it ca not be curved on the wood.,0
Marketing: yeah I think that would not work so well.,1
"Industrial Designer: basically what I'm gonna have to talk to you about today is component design, it is been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers,",0
"User Interface: So I think before we close, we are expected I mean the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer what our what our ideas where.",1
"Marketing: They need not to have any, much technical knowledge to see to know how to operate these remote controls.",0
Marketing: not everyone who is looking TV can go to internet when they want to see the latest news.,0
"Marketing: We had one hundred subjects, we observe their remote control use in a lab, then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire, see what was or not for them.",1
Project Manager: but on the other hand I do not know whether my superiors would be so glad with it because you have to introduce a complete new l line of of supplies.,0
Marketing: It needs to stand out.,1
Project Manager: And the Management Expert of the Marketing Expert.,0
"Project Manager: that the function we agreed was vole, power, nbers, enter, channels, a way to move between channels, easy to use, handheld.",1
"Industrial Designer: I guess the sample sens sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing, which puts up to four?",1
"Project Manager: I dunno talking about vo I mean obviously if you have got voice recognition then you can do it in that way because it will recognise the voice, you can give it a command, a set command whatever that happened to be.",1
User Interface: Sounds like it could be g a really good economical.,0
"Marketing: That is s that is sort of the But I I'm my hope here is that I'm putting out this information so that we can then say, well how do we collectively move on with it.",1
Industrial Designer: I'd give it a one.,1
"Project Manager: then you know they are gonna be fairly brightly coloured anyway, we can have sort of a trimming as well, of the glow in the dark material, just as gimmickyness.",1
"Project Manager: The power required, the ability to the cost, it seems like for an embedded system, this could cause us issues.",1
"User Interface: You might have some background noise from the TV which will make the speech recognition much harder, so.",0
User Interface: So I did some searching on the internet.,1
"Marketing: and then like one curve would just be like a single verticalish kind of looking thing,",0
"Marketing: Now the early adopters, those of us who grew up with technology, luck lucky for us have the cash to pay for it, the young age group without the mortgages, responsibilities, ninety one percent of them would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control.",1
"Project Manager: on the agenda for this, for this particular meeting, we will have your three presentations on what you have done since our last meeting, after we came up with some general ideas of our design.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, or we can ki do the kinetic cells.",1
"Industrial Designer: Do you think our two kind of overlap, because.",1
Marketing: I do think we have to put that underneath a clip.,1
Project Manager: It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons.,1
"Industrial Designer: Well I was gonna draw a cat too, so.",1
Project Manager: I'm just trying to make this pop up now.,0
"Project Manager: Mmhmm, that is the next one along, yeah?",0
"Marketing: We could also try to do the hinge thing, so it could like flip out that way.",1
"Industrial Designer: Well that can kinda tie into our changing face things, like we could have the fruit, vegetable theme this year.",0
"Marketing: Well, we have the logo there.",1
"Project Manager: otherwise becomes to complex, we wanna get this out very quickly.",0
Industrial Designer: And that is it.,0
Project Manager: The thing with I see would there not be a we'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen?,1
"Project Manager: Could you write the words, underneath it? Or more words.",1
"User Interface: sure my name is Agnes, I'm an user usability user interface designer.",0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, something that does not.",0
"Industrial Designer: and I will just make let is say fifteen buttons on it, we have three of those, actually just menus with submenus, with or subitems, subfunctions.",1
Marketing: Cause we are talking about eighty percent or ninety percent or ninetyfive percent of the televisions out there are teletext.,0
"Marketing: yeah, do did have nah y you have the black one.",1
Marketing: Do we is it necessary?,0
Project Manager: It is in the Well next I dunno who is next.,0
"Marketing: I will make this quick, since we do not have much time.",0
"Project Manager: you will receive some information by emails, i as usual.",1
User Interface: You just tu turn d.,0
"Marketing: Ah, a kind of snake? Cobra?",0
"Project Manager: I'm Fabien Cardinaux, I guess you can present yourself.",0
Project Manager: And do you see something else?,0
"Project Manager: Well maybe a two, because of the menu button or something.",1
User Interface: Or what will say? they will say it is splendid.,0
"User Interface: I think one of the things that we can put right on the box is, never buy another battery.",1
Industrial Designer: Yeah just explain the button Norman.,0
"Marketing: And, yeah, infrared might be an issue.",1
"User Interface: but if you want to get it working with a radio, you are in outside your garden with just one speaker, then maybe the range should be.",0
"Industrial Designer: The pr the problem with the button in the middle is, sorry.",0
Marketing: so on shape I gave it a one.,1
"Industrial Designer: Two million, yeah, two million.",0
Industrial Designer: I will rub that out.,0
"Marketing: So I will just give it a two, make this a one point five.",1
Project Manager: We are done.,0
"Project Manager: We did not bring it up yet, or at all in the meetings so far, but we are not gonna work with teletext because well it that is been taken over by the internet, so we are not gonna worry about we are not gonna worry about that.",1
User Interface: you want to st store your favourite channel.,1
"Project Manager: Yeah, I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting, not maybe too difficult to add.",0
"Industrial Designer: so do we need on the control different buttons to decide, or different light bulbs, would it be easier?, I dunno what we should decide on that.",1
Industrial Designer: but you d you were not paying attention as usual.,0
"Industrial Designer: Titanium is very No no, but you know b Titanium is very basic colour,",1
"Project Manager: everyone know what they are doing? 'Cause if you do not, you will I'm sure you will soon get an email about it.",0
Project Manager: But we might as well.,0
"Industrial Designer: I just want to make a summary of all things spoken, the different possibilities.",0
"Marketing: So what are you rating for this one, Paw?",0
"Industrial Designer: And for voice, limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required, we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote.",1
Industrial Designer: Which also makes a base station basically obsolete.,0
User Interface: D I do not know if that might cope with like the trendwatching.,0
Project Manager: Should be used only for the TV.,1
"User Interface: And actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea, is that people can actually do sort of quasimeasurements on their hand size, so if someone has larger hands, you have a wider remote control.",1
Industrial Designer: We went with shape because we were having fun with the playdough.,0
"Industrial Designer: Maybe if the, if it was just kind of a, more of a rubber coating which was on to a case.",1
Industrial Designer: but not for channels right.,1
"Industrial Designer: Well with the onehanded design you also have the problem of the size w 'cause you know from cell phones, they can be too small.",0
"Industrial Designer: That is possible, that is true.",1
"Project Manager: and we still on fifteen,",1
"Project Manager: discussion about that, a little closing at the end.",0
"Project Manager: Right so this meeting will be about the conceptual design, do not ask me s precisely what conceptual design is, it is just something important that we need to do.",1
"User Interface: then there is the latex cover, which is what you see as red.",1
"User Interface: So we are we will discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting, so for now we get the funct this is the functional designer? That is the first aspect.",1
Project Manager: So we get to know each other.,0
Marketing: so what this is a setup for us to use a kind of a like a.,0
"User Interface: It does scroll, but it is hugely complicated.",0
"Industrial Designer: and, so it could be in the television set, could be in the device, but somewhere you have to put the microphone, a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it is gets lost.",1
Marketing: like we are kind of what we are b sort of getting in into here is mating different design features together.,0
Industrial Designer: We do not control the TV set so well.,0
"Marketing: But then we should move to another target b because at twenty five Dollars,",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, I like that idea.",0
"User Interface: We can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition, I mean that I mean that you can kinda say would would fall under the user interface, the digital signal processing chip.",1
Project Manager: And w well functional design.,0
Project Manager: Not a lot thankfully to say.,0
"Marketing: Or something that has a turning dial, where at the far end is on or off.",1
"User Interface: Nah, I it is my opinion that I.",0
"Project Manager: So we we will wait for Anna, a few minutes.",1
Project Manager: Remote controls children proof.,1
"Marketing: So, well how we did do that?, well we made an investigation of the market, by Trendwatchers.",1
"Industrial Designer: You know, that picks up an input from a user, a logic a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device, the device has to r you know, based on you push button A, so I will do something with button A.",1
"Marketing: We are going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote, that m that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control, or just Yeah, the users, actually.",1
Project Manager: Finish the meeting now.,0
"Project Manager: and I think we do not need lighting adaptive, so the remote control should be only used for the television.",0
"User Interface: No rational changes or whatever, 'cause it revolutionary changes,",1
"Industrial Designer: Right, so, I'm supposed to draw my favourite animal.",0
"Marketing: Yeah, I think it is a beautiful.",0
Project Manager: And now we have to calculate the production costs.,1
Project Manager: to browse more easily the teletext.,0
Project Manager: as you can see that is what we do next on this thing.,0
"Project Manager: And the new product should reach new markets, which is the customers below forty.",1
"Industrial Designer: here again, that is my story about the different modes, if you do want to make remote universal, then the processor has to make up a different Morse code when some button is pressed.",0
Project Manager: What about integrating a scrollbar on this side?,0
"User Interface: Not to waste time, that is important.",0
Project Manager: So skip through this.,0
Marketing: You have to push hard.,0
"Industrial Designer: Well I think we have all learnt stuff from each other,",0
Project Manager: So do not m make a new file.,1
"Marketing: Style reflects a fruit inspired colour, design.",1
"Industrial Designer: So then the case material itself, so it can be either plastic or latex, rubber, wood, or titani.",0
Industrial Designer: Not that pen.,0
"Industrial Designer: And usually this so to do these functions we need an interface, which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that.",1
"Industrial Designer: The electronic components all of the electronic components have all those things like a chip, d diode transistors an Yeah, di can y you can see the TA double one eight three five labelled chip.",0
Industrial Designer: we are not using any of that.,0
Project Manager: So you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology?,0
"Marketing: I gotta I gotta flashlight,",0
"Marketing: shoes, furniture is fruits, vegetables, tha that there is a preference for spongy, tight material.",0
"Project Manager: get your own remote, or digital cable.",0
"Industrial Designer: yeah, y that is yeah.",0
"User Interface: yeah, but one thing we actually kind of forgot while designing, that one side was supposed to be rounder,",1
User Interface: So I think a scroll wheel is quite handy.,0
"Marketing: Our main audience, so that is people below forty, prefer the following.",1
"Marketing: So I'm kind of thinking, you know like those phones that they have, the new generation ones, where they do not actually have any buttons on them, stuff like that.",1
Marketing: but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment.,1
Project Manager: You have Not so difficult.,0
Project Manager: F I d I say five.,1
Project Manager: Whether you without hanging yourself.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, I would say definitely, I mean I mean I mean the idea of having it sort of articulated i th there would be basically two points of articulation.",1
Project Manager: That would be very handy.,0
Marketing: Just start summarising now.,0
"Marketing: Yeah, but it is an animal it is an animal that lives in the water.",0
User Interface: But it is very difficult to draw that in Yeah.,0
Industrial Designer: You e you only have one pen for that screen.,0
Marketing: we are going to look at these crite So.,0
"User Interface: And also the scroller button, how much will it cost.",1
"Marketing: second, I think you will get the most revenue from i from it.",1
Project Manager: Do you want.,0
"Project Manager: Now that would be one button, the question was that all buttons or is that just one button.",1
"Marketing: Of but I think What Is one false, or is t one true?",1
"Marketing: tha that was the main point, I think, from the trend in fashion.",0
"User Interface: Yeah, I think we could do l the logo in grey, as it is on the website.",1
"Project Manager: So I want each of your presentations to not be too long, five minutes, something like that.",1
"Industrial Designer: I mean like so what we could have is like three buckets, right, where we could throw things into,",1
Project Manager: Anybody have any experiences with remote controls that they can remember that.,0
Industrial Designer: Or something li like that.,1
Project Manager: then I'm gonna give it a two.,1
"Marketing: So you have a menu button, then you can go up, down.",1
Industrial Designer: still we need to cha.,0
"Industrial Designer: As an overall product which has to be quite cheap, we have just about achieved everything.",1
"Project Manager: well, it it is on the eraser now, so we click the pen button.",1
"Marketing: so y yeah you have you have it in your hand, the screen is below, the buttons are in the middle.",1
"Project Manager: we have our opening acquaintance, tool training, project plan description closing.",1
Marketing: Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality.,1
"User Interface: So just kind of minimise the clutter,",1
"Marketing: If you like held it down, that would be on off.",0
Project Manager: we I hope that next meeting we will we will take some decision that direction.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, but not too soft we have decided.",1
Project Manager: Th This is no chip.,0
Industrial Designer: The default spot for the onoff button.,1
Marketing: the joystick was not an option.,0
"Industrial Designer: so all of us got to express our opinions, yeah.",1
"Industrial Designer: so it can be some, you know, classic pushbutton like this one, or you have also some button like LCD where you know, the button the buttons are unlighted during the night,",1
"Marketing: yeah, that'd be fine, that'd be great.",0
"Marketing: I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire, to be honest.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, maybe we have m.",0
Industrial Designer: The display requires an advanced chip.,0
Industrial Designer: I see my bunny is still standing.,0
"Project Manager: anything else? You are also gonna have the channel tuner, as it were.",1
Marketing: Two point one seven.,1
Marketing: Yeah ma make it a special colour then.,0
"User Interface: So instead of opening the box you just kind of peel it, the remote control is inside.",0
"Project Manager: and we also have to find a, so, a fruit like pear or banana wit any others idea you have.",0
"Project Manager: I think we can kind of say we addressed it with colour, but.",1
Project Manager: But anyways we are here.,0
"User Interface: I'm hoping to go to the concert in Belgium, in Brussels in April first.",0
"Project Manager: Thank you, mister David Jordan.",0
User Interface: Yeah well pl the base station is made out of m many units of plastic.,1
"Project Manager: So I still think if it is cheap enough functionalitywise to include, it really should be in there.",1
"Industrial Designer: And then there are the pushbuttons, so you can have basic pushbuttons or a scrollwheels, like you have on a mouse, or you could have LCD, which gives you a display.",1
"Marketing: along with looking less ugly, if it looks better, eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it.",1
"Project Manager: And I know what you are all thinking of, my, because we are only given a forty minute time period to get it all in, including the production evaluation.",1
"User Interface: so that you do not have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it, especially if you have little kids around, they are not pressing the buttons while you are trying to watch a TV show, accidentally change the channel or turn it off.",1
User Interface: Would not give it more.,0
"Project Manager: I mean when it has speech recognition then i then it does not matter where it is, my well it is we should be in range,",0
"Marketing: But maybe just a little LED, I do not know.",1
Marketing: I'd probably go with three again for that one.,1
"Project Manager: We still want to have a recharger, do not we?",1
"Project Manager: our costs are below budget with recommendations that they the budget be increased, but I think I do not know, d what do you think? Do you think that is takes into account overheads like us being well paid kind of a thing? And the heating for the building, do you think our budget includes everything, all the costs that are going out?",1
"User Interface: But the second parts, like speech, etcetera, that will be harder to learn.",0
User Interface: W I will come to that point later on.,0
Marketing: The complexity should not be much higher.,0
"Industrial Designer: Just to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there, that we do have to fit the stuff in there.",0
"User Interface: Yeah, there is R, R in front.",0
User Interface: then that would be easier.,1
"Marketing: Well the criteria are based on the user requirements, the trends from the marketing research, the marketing strategy of the company itself.",1
"Project Manager: So Maybe, if it is possible, it is not too expensive, I think a joystick is better.",1
"Project Manager: it is short, it is.",0
"Project Manager: and we decided that it was gonna be nonrechargeable batterypowered, that we are gonna group our audiovisual, other functions into those categories.",1
"Marketing: Right, you take it apart, put on another face, take it off, put on another face.",1
Project Manager: We m have to make a new remote control.,1
"Marketing: Yeah I think the jog dial, you know it just after you drew that, what if it was flat, you just spun it,",1
"User Interface: ca not really see, but there is two possible ways, on the r left, if you see on th on the sides of the remote, you have the sort of scroll down, so you have that option right there.",1
"Marketing: And so I will show you some of the results from that, which I think will be helpful.",1
Marketing: I will just leave it there.,1
"Project Manager: But if you have got a if you have got a flipped thing, effectively it is something that is curved on one side, flat on the other side, but you folded it in half.",1
Industrial Designer: Export as J PEG.,0
"Project Manager: They have like removable plastic cases, so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one, or whatever,",1
Project Manager: So we need to tally up how much our w our product will be costing.,1
User Interface: I think the broccoli would be out.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, I think it is a really good idea.",0
User Interface: we would not even need the numbers.,0
"Project Manager: But anyway it would ha it has to have some kind of symbols, text or something so that people kn.",0
"Marketing: The trend is spong spongy, fruit or fresh.",0
"Industrial Designer: Production costs estimated by our manufacturing department, the research department, which is us, is fifteen point eight Euros,",1
Industrial Designer: Wh what is the limit?.,0
"Industrial Designer: it is I think it is cheaper if you if you already built the all the functionalities on the same module, but.",0
Industrial Designer: not that pen.,0
"Project Manager: but I think pretty much we have used cheap relatively cheap, simple things.",0
"Marketing: So just trying to answer all the questions, if the user would be happy to have something or something else.",1
"User Interface: having a look at the existing products, I found out that it tends to come in sort of two extremes, there is either a very complicated one that is got lots of buttons, lots of colours, very confusing, you do not know what you are doing.",1
"User Interface: especially the important buttons, if you want to switch channel, change your vole, use teletext, it it has to work at once, more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote, behind a little little thing or a touch screen.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, but suppose you got a cold.",1
Industrial Designer: I always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing.,1
"Project Manager: after the lunch break it is back to individual work, once again thirty minutes.",0
Industrial Designer: That is quite what PowerPoint does.,0
"Project Manager: So basically the I'm just gonna just recap what I said at the start, was that the whole point of this meeting was to f absolutely finalise who we are gonna aim this at,",0
"User Interface: It is leaning backwards, I think, in the in the docking station.",1
"User Interface: Alright, see you in thirty minutes.",0
"User Interface: and it is easy to use this, you have so this is a standard infrared eye, then you have a power button, which l vole, what you have,",1
"User Interface: changeable casings our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package to kind of set the idea that you can change it, you can try changing it.",1
"User Interface: Could you post some other essentials of what people want, so that I can work with some buttons, where to put it.",1
"Marketing: So I can go presuming I have, on my television, something that tells me what channel I'm on, I can scroll direct from channel five to channel thirty two.",1
Marketing: It is good for group spirit.,0
"User Interface: Well yeah, a colour of a wood style, a white c, a couple of h hip fruity colours.",1
Marketing: I could not understand it if it was fifty cents per per button.,0
"User Interface: If you have fifty functions you do not want fifty buttons t to be shown at the same time,",0
"Marketing: So, it, I think I will give it a yeah, yeah, yeah, a four.",1
"User Interface: I think we shall have a limited number of buttons,",1
"Project Manager: There was just too little information about what things actually cost, if you could use them.",0
"Marketing: so I think, you know, a screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that.",1
Industrial Designer: The case can be either spongy rubber or hard plastic.,0
"Project Manager: So you will be leading the team for your design team or how many members is working in the team, for the design?",0
"Industrial Designer: You can even if we are coming from mice, we can even add a click function, where you, in order to verify the information you just press it down.",1
Marketing: It is not an apple.,0
"User Interface: No, it is, yeah I understand.",0
"Marketing: but if you see elderly people, all these buttons, then they buy new TV because their previous one was stolen or whatever.",1
"Project Manager: by the sounds of it, with what we are suggesting so far, your design the user interface is still quite open, you could go for quite an interesting design.",1
Project Manager: We now can concentrate on the on the basic remote control.,1
"User Interface: So in the case of many user interfaces, they are just so full of buttons that it is actually hard to find the ones you really want to use, it is just confusing, it takes y know time to learn.",1
"Industrial Designer: It is possible, but you ca not use double curves for titanium.",0
"Marketing: So I guess what we are looking at here is people want this h technology, they tend to use the most simple controls, overall they find remote controls to be something they do not does not really appeal to them.",0
Marketing: I think these are the practical problems.,1
Project Manager: People do not buy a new remote every so often.,0
"Project Manager: we want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy, a completely new style, so that, can really appeal to a, to a generation that does not want a simple plain kind of, channelchanger.",1
Industrial Designer: And the video button.,1
Marketing: That would bring up the price of the scrollwheel also.,1
"Marketing: Yeah, plastic with special colour.",0
"Project Manager: We have five minutes left for the meeting, so.",1
Industrial Designer: May maybe that could be the backup.,1
Project Manager: Yeah it is handy.,0
"User Interface: So, I would be inclined to go sort of towards this, in terms of design, rather than this.",1
Marketing: Seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot.,1
"User Interface: multifunctional controls can be difficult to use, as the multitude of buttons can be confusing.",1
Project Manager: If it is fancy.,0
Project Manager: Sometimes it is under or equal.,0
User Interface: but it will be hard to configure I mean imagine i.,0
"User Interface: because some TVs have the possibility to adjust brightness, that kind of menus.",1
"Industrial Designer: Well I guess more realistically then, we need a product that is got some kinda nifty outer casing, cheap plastic, you know, that should be just like a tenth of the price maybe or less.",1
Marketing: Easy to use.,1
User Interface: And later we can d do the design.,0
"Project Manager: We take it to the other meeting,? I have a little w little chat to do.",1
Project Manager: I had speech recognition requires advanced req require.,0
"Project Manager: want it to look uncluttered, undaunting to the customer.",0
Marketing: they just make it look ugly.,1
"User Interface: So we'd either have a small LCD display on the device itself, or have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television, can b be controlled through the device.",1
"Project Manager: Then we have five, one.",0
"Industrial Designer: You can have a kinetic provision of energy, which is used on some watches these days.",1
Project Manager: we can just incorporate into the actual plastic on top.,1
Project Manager: The evaluation give satisfying result as well.,0
Project Manager: I think I would give a five.,1
Industrial Designer: Yeah you could squish it.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah you could do a colour change, so therefore you would yeah I mean that is effectively what they did with the with the mobile phones, was to have some in blue, some in red, some in rather than all in black.",0
"Industrial Designer: The question is when you are rolling it, how do you wanna roll it?",0
"Marketing: is the remote control fancy enough,",1
User Interface: 'Cause even if we have contacts we ca not really produce a remote control that can bring up menus on other companies' TVs.,0
"Industrial Designer: So, all the buttons has to have to be the same colour.",1
"Project Manager: The same as a telephone, or a mobile phone, or what do you mean?",1
Project Manager: that was a bit of a conflict.,0
Project Manager: Does not work.,0
Marketing: Apparently I'm supposed to use the whiteboard.,1
"Industrial Designer: So it is yellow, very a very ha it is very happy, so.",0
"Project Manager: But you guys felt that you could keep the, yeah, suspension of disbelief kind of like the role, the?",1
Marketing: So in addition remotes were not very functional.,0
"Project Manager: Because apparently from your survey people like colours, no?",1
Industrial Designer: We can also make a button with a menu button.,0
User Interface: Where is delete button?,0
"User Interface: The second concept is a fancy controller, so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive, they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products, so the u the user f the u user interface should be very cute, very g.",1
User Interface: G so what happens is you do not have to press your thumb too down like.,0
Project Manager: I still have the total report to finish up.,0
"Marketing: Cause it seems like an interesting option especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these you know four or five basic functions, you can have.",1
Project Manager: I mean maximum we have another four point three euros I mean four thirty.,1
User Interface: What we can change is to propose the customers with skins.,1
"Project Manager: If you two could both do that as well, in case we need to refer to it.",0
Project Manager: I do not know.,0
Project Manager: So thank you for your suggestion.,0
Project Manager: So we are going for the for the recharger.,1
"User Interface: And also in the numpads, there is also colour light behind it.",1
Project Manager: I'm going local.,0
User Interface: I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something.,1
"User Interface: Could it It would be good if it had the actual programme that was on, what was next.",1
"User Interface: It means that it can recognize, it can do like a match on a on a certain phrase that you speak, then can play back a phrase in response to that.",1
"Marketing: Yeah, but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to.",0
"Marketing: If you can find me, where I'm at.",0
Marketing: Sort of flat as possible.,0
"User Interface: So if you have got a combined system, it could be a combined remote.",1
"Industrial Designer: if somebody is gonna h talk to the device, you ideally want them to hold it to them.",1
"User Interface: or something for the elderly, where the remote is very large, the buttons are very large, there is only a few buttons.",0
Project Manager: then it is I think one.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, you have some more.",0
Marketing: or is this just ideas?,0
"Industrial Designer: also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use, so I was thinking perhaps a combination of solar cells with a backup basic battery, somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that will last the lifetime or the five to ten years, we could still keep that original idea.",0
"Project Manager: Yeah, m but a w n a calculator also works on r on solar cells.",0
Project Manager: Our selling price.,1
"Project Manager: Yeah, special material r also,",0
"Project Manager: Well, something else that you brought up was the ability to lose a remote, which as you said you have done, in fact we have probably all done.",0
"Industrial Designer: I think that might be a little too aggressive,",0
Industrial Designer: How did you get that in there?,0
Industrial Designer: it is a British thing.,0
"Project Manager: so fifteen to thirty five, look fairly young.",1
"Project Manager: Sorry? Yeah, you will have to look that up.",0
Project Manager: Anything else? Alright.,0
Industrial Designer: So maybe if you could have some kind of tracking device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was.,1
"Marketing: It is it is safer for them, I guess.",0
Project Manager: that is for the speech.,0
Industrial Designer: Well what are the options?,0
"Project Manager: did we find any, no.",0
Project Manager: And there are three presentations.,1
"Industrial Designer: Well you could come up with like novelty ones, like they have done with the mobile phones, you can get like different you know scenes from different movies, stuff on the remote control.",0
User Interface: Because tomorrow this will be more appealing because you can add lot of sophistication on that.,1
Project Manager: You did work together did not you?,0
"Project Manager: It is just for user customizable, for kids or old people.",1
Marketing: seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly.,1
Project Manager: I will give it a one.,1
"Marketing: S, I was gonna talk about the programmable remote control.",1
"User Interface: Not one colour, but the pattern needs to be recognisable.",1
User Interface: So I'd give it a four.,0
"Project Manager: Maybe you should hold your pen a bit more to the back, so that no, to the yeah.",1
Industrial Designer: unfortunately I do not have costing information.,0
User Interface: You can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company.,1
"User Interface: I think, people find that important,'cause then it is easy to use.",0
Industrial Designer: I will just be talking about the components design.,1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",0
"Project Manager: What do you reckon, five, six?",1
"Marketing: Or it could be like this, as the people say, if they have a LCD on the remote not on the television.",1
Marketing: And evaluation of the thingy.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yes, but some old televisions you have to click on a special button, then you go to a next level, you can push two buttons.",1
"Marketing: you have been in Milan a couple of times, so.",0
"Industrial Designer: findings, that is the point that I'm working on currently but so far I was looking what are the blue circuit, I mean radio wave radio frequency circuits are available now,",0
"Project Manager: An interesting point is that if the person does not have the computer, we can still make the process easier because instead of having to look up codes, maybe we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the LCD.",1
"Project Manager: Nah, there is some money left to be spent.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative, so.",1
"Industrial Designer: No, then we have to sell it for thirty Euros.",1
"Project Manager: Right, I'm gonna take minutes while, you guys express your favourite animals.",1
"Project Manager: And the production costs should not be more than twelve Euro fifty, so we should keep that in mind by w during the development, because, well, those are important nbers.",1
Project Manager: I would say no need for a talkback.,1
"Industrial Designer: like you just grab it, you do not have to s look at it, you know, which way around to point it.",0
"User Interface: Like, you want to find it, you shout.",1
"Industrial Designer: So basically going with our trend of vegetables, we selected the colour, approximate shape of banana.",0
"Project Manager: I started filling it in, but of course these are provisional, so we have to go down.",0
"User Interface: No, I dunno.",0
"Industrial Designer: So are we gonna are we talking we need to figure out what kind of buttons we are going to use, are we going to use scroll buttons? Rubber buttons?",0
Project Manager: So we can go to through to project evaluation.,1
Project Manager: Well I thought my leadership was crap personally.,0
"Marketing: and plus you can get you know even though we are using plastic, you can still I mean think of the designs you can get in plastic, we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior.",1
User Interface: they are just the very basics you could use for a TV.,0
"Marketing: well I guess, just from my findings it looks like we wanna minimise buttons.",1
Project Manager: a fair amount.,0
User Interface: Will you be presenting that in a bit?,0
Project Manager: we just have to see what it looks like.,0
"Marketing: You know some blend of silvers, blacks.",0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, a kind of joystick.",0
"User Interface: Yeah, I would say buttons,",1
Project Manager: we are actually doing this meeting to start a new project which is about designing a remote control.,1
"Marketing: If you have an LCD on the remote control, what would you think of it.",1
User Interface: Well we make it more expensive to buy.,1
Project Manager: I said uncurved or flat.,0
Project Manager: do you have trouble whistling?,0
"User Interface: Yeah, but it is it is not a picture or, well, is it?",0
Project Manager: Solar can do that.,0
"Marketing: And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use,",1
"Project Manager: I will go over what we decided last meeting,",1
Project Manager: Put that on the button bottom.,1
"Project Manager: You kn you know, Ruud, as well? About th.",0
User Interface: Well it is not on the desktop.,0
Project Manager: well according to our agenda it is then time to take a decision on the remote control functions.,0
Project Manager: you are going to have a presentation.,0
Project Manager: Teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet.,1
Industrial Designer: in the project I'm supposed to be the technic.,1
"Industrial Designer: But they really need the regular chip, you cannot use the sa simple.",1
"Project Manager: As you can see you have to move it a little bit slow, it is not such a fast board, it is a smart board but also a slow board.",1
"Project Manager: I'm just gonna have a little PowerPoint presentation for us, for our kickoff meeting.",1
Project Manager: So that does not really matter.,0
Project Manager: Not enough buttons you mean?,0
Industrial Designer: With a simple command like locate.,1
Project Manager: So you you'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can.,0
Project Manager: So what could I draw? Maybe I can draw like a very simplified cow.,1
Project Manager: I should I think I sh.,0
User Interface: You should you should have a black one.,0
"User Interface: but maybe that comes up, I do not know.",0
User Interface: so that it is always be there.,0
"Marketing: so do we just add it up, divide it by four? Is that what the company does?",0
Project Manager: We definitely should use it.,1
"User Interface: Do yous not find that, like, there is a lot of, buttons on your remote control, you do not know what half of them do.",1
"Marketing: So say with the f with the findings, with the research, easy to use something totally new.",1
"Industrial Designer: Well, that is the pushbutton too, right there.",0
User Interface: Cause it should be there.,0
"Marketing: Yeah, you do not know how much it costs, the LCD screen.",1
Industrial Designer: Richard is argument was very good.,0
Industrial Designer: most of them are powered by some form of battery.,1
Marketing: So I'd be up for seven for innovation.,1
Project Manager: If I have not overstepped.,0
Industrial Designer: So that the only the simple functions will be visible at first.,0
Project Manager: It is a bit off.,0
"User Interface: And then well personal preferences I would basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing where the we could have both the the f a TV, the remote video remote control because some of the keys in the video is remote control, the TV they could be integrated together so that we could aim for the like in the f coming future that type of applications with.",0
"User Interface: I'm just thinking you know with all these universal remotes that are out there, how many people how many people actually use every feature that ar you know i like these trainable remotes, things like that, where, you know, it is just so confusing to do to use all these functions.",1
"Project Manager: User requirements specifi Well, this one was already clear to us.",0
"Project Manager: programming it to use your TV, you might hook it up to the PC.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, or on the slide function, I do not know.",0
"Marketing: But even just a thing to attach it to the w you know if you had a thing, a pretty object attached to the wall.",1
"Marketing: you know, as it goes.",0
"User Interface: Well, maybe only a two or a three then, 'cause it is no we still have not decided about specific sponginess or specific.",1
"Marketing: We never were pushed for time, or sat around doing nothing, so.",1
"Industrial Designer: The kinetic energy one is that e they are usually modern watches, since our hand keeps moving, it keeps the watch ticking.",1
"Marketing: So that then you need five buttons, one integrated scrollwheel pushbutton.",0
Project Manager: Case material we said rubber.,1
Marketing: and I do not understand why it would be in separate meetings that you'd do that.,0
"Project Manager: yeah well th that is one I s that is one I sent you,",0
User Interface: So we made them a bit bigger.,1
"Industrial Designer: How Yeah, but how do I.",0
User Interface: I'd be happy with a two.,0
"Project Manager: And then you or the idea is that the whichever person is at the other end can point them in the right direction, show them where to either give them directly give them help, or secondly, point them in the right direction, either at the library, or or come back, or go, see Joe Bloggs, or whatever.",0
Project Manager: G go on ahead.,0
"Industrial Designer: But if you want to look at the screen, no.",0
"Marketing: And this size here, I'd suggest this be small, like quite small.",1
Marketing: then it w it could possibly sell.,1
"Project Manager: so, mister money, what is your opinion according to this remote control?",0
Industrial Designer: If we want to have more features than that.,1
"Industrial Designer: Well, we are only four Euro over budget.",0
"User Interface: One thing you have gotta keep in mind, keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time.",1
Project Manager: it says interface.,0
Project Manager: welcome to our detailed design meeting.,1
"Industrial Designer: The main elements of remote controls in general, therefore ours as well, are the case, the buttons, the circuit board with the chip, the battery.",1
"User Interface: Unfortunately they do not have silver fruits, vegetables.",0
"Industrial Designer: Well, maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control.",1
"Project Manager: so every time we we will do some individual work, get meeting, talk about it, then go into the next phase.",1
"Project Manager: Maybe a colour that remember some fruit, things like that.",1
"Project Manager: This is very straightforward, with the save, the print, the undo, the blank, the select, the pen.",1
Marketing: so do not overlap them.,0
"Project Manager: we are going to make a remote control, you already know that.",0
Marketing: Maybe the thing that convince me the less is the the multifunctional buttons.,0
User Interface: Which is not an option.,0
Project Manager: One with LCD.,1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, you have some TVs any.",0
Industrial Designer: We do not have the money to do it towards t f technology so we should we should aim at design.,1
"Marketing: But they will also really drag up the production costs, so think we will have to see about that too.",0
"Project Manager: Well, we are under cost then.",0
"Project Manager: If you, if we want the remote to do other things like or I guess the TV to be able to change the tint, the colour, you know all those kind of things that are built into TVs, we just have that under one standard menu button where you go in, press the menu button, scroll up, down to select it.",1
Industrial Designer: but you know we integrated them with different colour.,0
Project Manager: And we will turn to the next presentation.,0
Project Manager: Well maybe where the one hand.,0
"Project Manager: So the browse function, as you m mentioned.",1
"Project Manager: And it is the same thing what happens, a g remote control gives another signal after five seconds that is just one.",0
"Project Manager: you each have things to do, look, feel design, user interface design, product evaluation, you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay.",1
"Marketing: First of all, they find it very ugly.",1
"Industrial Designer: We can it is a veg a kind of vegetable,",0
"Marketing: Could be a red apple, yeah.",1
Industrial Designer: It is a wombat.,0
"Marketing: So, I would give this a two.",1
"User Interface: Well, I have here a couple of basic functions I could think of.",1
User Interface: basically there are too many buttons.,0
Project Manager: We could do that.,1
"Marketing: If you make people brandaware, they are willing to pay more.",1
"Marketing: But the logo the logo should not be exchangeable, when you get off the front.",1
"Marketing: Yeah but then again you still have a lot of buttons,",0
"Industrial Designer: And you can choose colours on your day for each day, or even many colours.",1
"Project Manager: in that like i withing menus there are submenus, so how do you get back to the main menu?",1
"Industrial Designer: maybe it can be one of those, if you press down, hold for two seconds, then it brings you back one level or something.",1
"User Interface: Right, I think they do want to do hand writing recognition on that, it is just the first step.",1
"User Interface: I would say I would agree with you on the colour,",1
"Marketing: w one is bad, seven is the best.",0
User Interface: I guess that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy.,1
"Project Manager: N, next meeting starts in thirty minutes.",1
"Project Manager: What we have to do now is to go back to our little places, complete our questionnaire, some sort of summarisation, which y you will get immediately by email.",1
"Project Manager: And your design whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple, so.",1
Marketing: we next wanna see if it has a spongy quality.,0
"User Interface: So maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit,",1
Project Manager: And one that way.,0
"Marketing: A blue, black zebra.",0
"User Interface: It is just yeah, yeah.",0
Marketing: It c it can go open.,0
"Project Manager: next meeting starts in thirty minutes, well, you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it.",1
"Industrial Designer: So if you sum up everything wi with the LCD, which costs two dollar, you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two.",1
"User Interface: We should only make a remote control, nothing more.",1
Industrial Designer: If we want to use the scrollwheels we need the regular version.,0
User Interface: I guess that is true.,0
"Marketing: so, do you think, since we This was a sign criteria, do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle then?",0
"Project Manager: I think we will be a bit a bit longer,",0
User Interface: Actually it is a flexible thing.,0
Project Manager: It is in three step as you know.,1
"Marketing: And especially I guess 'cause this has the speech recognition as well,",1
"Marketing: There are other aspects like LCD screens, speech recognition which were not I do not think, in my personal opinion, gonna be worth the extra expense, the extra effort that will go into them.",1
Project Manager: you choose a new colour.,1
"Industrial Designer: The energy source would be a battery, simple battery that you can find anywhere.",1
"Industrial Designer: So we have to make a chip that produces patterns to, y you know, to.",1
"Marketing: No, well, the agenda says evaluate now, so I think we.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, it is put F five.",0
User Interface: so move to the next slide.,0
"User Interface: cause there are already, like you said, so many controls out that support lot of stuff.",1
Marketing: Her speech recognition feature would be a supplement.,1
"Marketing: and you can always use a front on it, you know? You can use it just plain.",0
Marketing: Eighty hundred per cent of users would spend more money when the remote control would look.,0
"User Interface: I'm not sure if there is any other examples of that, but something to look out for.",0
User Interface: Minimise its size.,0
Project Manager: Zero to nine.,0
"Marketing: So, like, I wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market,",1
"Industrial Designer: The case is silver titanium, no?",1
"Industrial Designer: And sports, gaming device style characteristics.",0
"User Interface: It is you program it like you say, record, then, play, then, record, play machine, stuff like that, so that is And it is much Yeah.",1
"Marketing: Also huh uhhuh the buttons, are they easy to find? That was a big requirement of the old people.",1
Project Manager: Maybe this one? Then we can save this one in the folders group.,1
"Marketing: And I looked at the design reports from previous years, here at Real Remote.",0
Industrial Designer: Y it should be done.,1
"Marketing: So you got your buttons one to nine, your on, off, your volume on that.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, but if you u if you do that, you know that you are sending a signal.",0
Project Manager: this just to give us a rough idea of what we are meant to be doing for the next stage.,0
Project Manager: That is a very good idea And then maybe we can go a th Matthew is presentation because.,0
Marketing: I mean we have to look for a tradeoff.,1
"Marketing: I mean, it has a shape.",0
Industrial Designer: when you say when you press one it says one or it says hello.,1
"Project Manager: It is rubber as it is, yes.",0
"Marketing: So I think we should specify some prerequirements if we want to use a voice commands, say that it should be used in an silent homely environment or s something.",1
Project Manager: I think it would be a b.,0
"Industrial Designer: I was not really given any options, I was just given that this is how they are done.",0
"Marketing: This is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation, the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements, the hot trends introduced by the marketing department.",1
"User Interface: you are right, sorry, yes.",0
User Interface: I it is not possible.,0
Project Manager: Do not chip on me.,0
"Project Manager: well that is might be a unique selling point, huh for a remote.",1
"Industrial Designer: we have an even more advanced shape, which is curved in three dimension.",1
"Project Manager: straight to trends, then we can discuss it all at once.",1
"Marketing: Well y you know, it is this fruit, vegetable year.",1
"Project Manager: we have revisited the touch screen, more or less ruled that out, I think so we are more or less con we wh we are more or less in agreement that we want to have a a simple kind of function, you know, not too complex.",1
Project Manager: Here is what we looking at satisfaction on for example room for creativity.,0
Industrial Designer: It just seems kind of like a needless th.,0
Industrial Designer: And then I was just had a quick look at the external design but I d I left that mostly to the interface designer.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, I have one too.",0
Project Manager: then do not worry about that.,0
Industrial Designer: We are really having just pushbutton interface.,0
"User Interface: And then other menus for DV as well as TV, whether that means like we can go, decide the brightness of the screen, things like that, all the more complicated functions of menus.",1
"Project Manager: So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections,",1
"Project Manager: Well, I was more thinking about the fruit colours that the Ruud showed us before.",1
Industrial Designer: maybe sometimes people get scared with the number of buttons.,0
"Project Manager: And then marketing will look, see what what people want.",0
Marketing: And that would sort of maybe keep us close on the sort of the fashion type one.,1
"User Interface: I think we include mute, but apart from that I think we just we will go for the simpleness.",1
Project Manager: so the remote control functions.,1
"User Interface: sorry, maybe I should have should not have said it beforehand but.",0
"Industrial Designer: It is more advanced, but I'm I think you should combine it with batteries.",1
Project Manager: Or maybe we should m we could draw something a bit that has it on the bottom.,0
"Project Manager: I will I will send you a mail,? The project may be the project aim.",1
"User Interface: one thing I thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it, just like you have on flip phones,",1
User Interface: I think we had a nice time.,1
Project Manager: So we are this way around.,0
Marketing: Also the z the design should fit the hand shape.,0
Industrial Designer: I am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now after reading about them.,0
Industrial Designer: Although we could have made the Rs better had we had five more minute.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, the other one was the other one was a kinetic thing where you'd basically have to wind it yourself.",1
Industrial Designer: And when would you like that?,0
"Marketing: Free, I like the elephant.",1
"Industrial Designer: Not very complex commands, but easy commands,",1
"Industrial Designer: so five to ten, I think it is feasible.",1
Project Manager: I am the one who can say that.,0
Project Manager: So I guess we are looking at having a discussion at this point in time to help you folks design our new model as it were.,0
Project Manager: right now it is an elk.,1
Project Manager: Are there any questions for clarification of Maarika before we go on to the next one?,0
"Marketing: And yeah, I think the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons, 'cause wh if we got a remote that like well we will have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext, but we are going to see on the that some of the functions like audio settings are not h hardly ever used, used very are not considered relevant by the user.",1
User Interface: and these were just a couple examples of different kinds that are a little bit more unusual.,0
Industrial Designer: we want to follow general trend.,1
Marketing: Does anyone have costs on the on the web?,0
"Marketing: also, as opposed to last year, this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel.",1
Project Manager: 'Cause I think we.,0
Project Manager: so see you for next successful project.,0
"Project Manager: When you make it titanium, it becomes more like some kind of gadget you actually do not need.",0
"Marketing: You need a one to zero button, next channel, previous channel,",0
Marketing: And then are we going for sort of one button shaped like a fruit.,1
Marketing: So we should change this as well.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, w around the buttons, or in the buttons even.",1
"User Interface: everything is going t ergonomic, you know, there is you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic, keyboards, that could be one of our niches p sort of in the market, I guess.",1
"User Interface: I think it is pretty standard, these rubber buttons on the top.",1
"Project Manager: I think the p yeah, the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement, just make a button on your TV.",1
Industrial Designer: So you know it is just a matter of working out space.,0
"Industrial Designer: It, it stops it, I mean,",0
"Marketing: Maybe, it could it could be on the bottom, so you would not loo like if it is flat here, so it sits up.",0
Project Manager: The voice recognition are not.,1
"Marketing: You know you can say anything you want no matter how silly it sounds you know it should run your car, it should heat up your motor if should turn on your CD whatever you want it to do.",0
Industrial Designer: So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house.,1
Industrial Designer: It should be able to.,1
Project Manager: I'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those.,0
"Project Manager: So you will have to work on the look, feel design, to have the easy to use, powerful, fancy remote control with some added value such as the simple vocal commands recognition.",1
"User Interface: Yeah but only for the basic functi if you are going to use the advanced option, you are going to press the menu button, then yeah.",0
Project Manager: I will just attach it to an email.,1
"Marketing: No, if you use one button, it must turn on for twenty seconds, then it must turn off.",1
"Industrial Designer: also the remote control should be used only for television, because incorporating other features makes it more comp complex.",0
Project Manager: And you have the scroll button inside.,1
Project Manager: So we could say that was our target.,0
User Interface: also in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities.,0
"Marketing: So, we need the average here, so we got.",1
"Industrial Designer: So there would have to, have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons, or something.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, it can be a crocodile, it can be a crocodile.",1
Marketing: Because I think one of the things were complaining about in my what I found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one.,0
Industrial Designer: and then what colour for the buttons?,0
Project Manager: Yeah I do not know.,0
"Marketing: is it in innovative enough, is it easy enough to use.",1
"Industrial Designer: it is light, strong but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for a remote.",0
"User Interface: W Could we just make the bubbles cut off the back, then we are has.",0
Industrial Designer: And the advanced we'd have to go with a LCD s display.,0
"Industrial Designer: But they keep generally their t slash this thing, then the dash, then you can put yeah, you can only have one bit.",1
"User Interface: So we have to, I dunno, make a different shape than usual.",1
Project Manager: Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen implications.,0
"Project Manager: And talk about our finances, whether we were under or over our budget.",1
Industrial Designer: Yes you have to draw a rat if you want a rat.,1
User Interface: I thought a little bit about the interface.,0
"Marketing: But if I open it, then save it, probably will be there.",0
Marketing: I think we can use Excel.,0
"Industrial Designer: you go to so many houses these days, you see broken remote controls.",0
Project Manager: I think I'm leaning towards the potato.,1
"Marketing: so some things I had in my presentation, they already told,",1
Industrial Designer: About the components design.,0
Industrial Designer: We have been quite successful with the rubber coating.,0
"Industrial Designer: what kind of market we are targeting? Is it that we are targeting the replacement remote market, or what? So the remote has gone bad, the person wants to buy a new remote or because the cost of LCD thing could be as high as the TV itself.",1
"User Interface: One three, a few ones.",0
"User Interface: It is it it is no, well, it is it will recognize I guess keywords, but you know keywords in a certain order like a phrase.",1
"Project Manager: and then say if we'd had our budget, we would have had this,",0
"Marketing: I mean it is not that important, easy to use, but.",0
Project Manager: The buttons are regular colour.,1
"User Interface: Do we put the volume control, the channel control here, or do we put it on he Would we like to press it in the middle?",1
"User Interface: which is also nice, easy to hold, feels good, has a similar sort of scroll push button technology, just a slightly different design.",1
Project Manager: we have sorted of discussed costs.,0
Marketing: Maybe we can give it out in different colours.,0
"User Interface: I like dogs because, they are so good to hans, like they can be trained to be police dogs, seeingeye dogs, they are just such friendly animals.",1
Industrial Designer: But other users who are new to this device need something like that.,1
Industrial Designer: So that is that.,0
"Marketing: But I think the key is to get the early adopters, people who are familiar with technology, they will be.",1
Project Manager: I thought went well.,1
"Industrial Designer: So you know, as we said, we got the outer casing, which we have to decide, you know, what is it gonna be, the board we have to use basically the same setup, processor, we will probably use the more advanced processor than they had, amplifier, transmitter are all standard.",1
"User Interface: So I think there is quite a lot of like Dolby surround studio, surround sort of things.",1
"Industrial Designer: simple, regular, advanced chip on print.",1
"Marketing: as well as characters, different keypad styles, s symbols.",0
Marketing: We have to give our customers some extras.,1
Marketing: And the third most important aspect is that the remote control should be easy to use.,0
Marketing: but I have no idea.,0
Marketing: The iPod packaging is me like was so that was like half the fun.,0
"Project Manager: And then we will discuss if we have few ideas, we will end by dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process.",0
"Marketing: We need to keep it simple, have limited buttons, which I think the two piece idea might be really beneficial for.",1
"Marketing: And users are actually zapping a lot, so they are using the device intensively, that is something to take into account as well.",0
Industrial Designer: I'm sure that'd be fine.,0
User Interface: Are you talking about this or that?,0
"Project Manager: if you consider our budget, to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey.",1
Marketing: Why do not I get that?.,0
Marketing: Because the last two questions is much more important than the rest actually.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, we will not use this.",1
"Industrial Designer: No no, not at all.",0
Project Manager: And maybe fun.,0
"Marketing: so the average of that is three six nine divided by five, so five nine by five, one point s eight?",1
User Interface: So that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend.,1
Project Manager: Is that how most people feel about that?,0
User Interface: L let is make first the all the views.,0
"Marketing: and, you know, channel selection, volume selection are absolutely essential, the power, well it is not quite so essential, apparently, although I do not understand how it could not be,",0
"Marketing: I think having a shape could be a little ridiculous,",1
"Marketing: That is only for speech recognition, screen.",0
Industrial Designer: So how it is gonna look.,0
User Interface: you need to record the channels.,1
"Industrial Designer: but so at this stage, how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or I mean in we can completely do away with buttons, have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that.",0
"User Interface: which is really nice, fun, good to hold, nice, big, easy buttons to press, but still quite simple, quite cost effective.",1
"Marketing: Yeah, it is a real pen.",0
User Interface: we need somebody to develop that.,0
Industrial Designer: I will say two as well.,0
"User Interface: It is true that you always sit around you know, you are sitting on your sofa, you wanna change something, there is five different remotes, one for the DVD, one for the video, one for cable, one for whatever else.",1
Project Manager: Also the slogan? On the.,0
User Interface: You want me to b unplug that?,0
"Project Manager: that is the market we have to target, because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers.",1
"Industrial Designer: y you s you see the fi thing is when you buy a remote, you set the channels, the channels are different on each te television,",1
User Interface: let is add one instead of two.,0
Project Manager: No I do not think so.,0
User Interface: But that is very expensive.,0
"Project Manager: I'm not sure what teletext is but I'm assing you guys do, so we do not wanna include that in this particular design.",0
"Project Manager: Because I think it will, five minutes from to finish meeting.",0
"Project Manager: S so like cur slightly transparent case, so it is yellow, like tinted yellow, but you can maybe see through it.",1
"Project Manager: Just when you enter you say, it is real reaction.",0
"User Interface: Although you do not wanna cut cut women out of the potential buyers though,",0
User Interface: I'm still not convinced of the.,0
"Marketing: The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look, feel, technological innovation, it should be easy to use, it should incorporate current fashion trends, those the two main ones, they were the spongy texture, the fruit, vegetable strong design colours.",1
User Interface: instantly sort of always going for the righthanded person.,1
"Industrial Designer: Also, the speaker in the remote control, when we want to retrieve it.",0
"Marketing: So I think we will have to talk to our executive managers, see if we can get away with just the RR.",0
"Project Manager: So maybe we can start with this, calling this one.",0
"Marketing: And in the end I will show you our target audience or our target product users, customers.",0
"Project Manager: Yeah, I have still ten minutes to finish the report.",1
"Industrial Designer: Well it d That is the most expensive chip, we need.",1
"User Interface: And so the last thing I thought w which I quickly mentioned in the other one was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people, like glowinthedark.",1
"Project Manager: Well, there is a production evaluation.",1
User Interface: I got like one email after ten minutes or something.,1
User Interface: I give it a I give it a five.,1
User Interface: which I am sure most of you know about.,0
Project Manager: I think it is innovative to use the the wheel because I think no one else has.,0
"Industrial Designer: so these are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control, whatever new functions that we need to do, make the chip more complicated, bigger, basically.",1
"Marketing: Is it is it actually a book of names to digits, or is it like a few pages?",0
"Marketing: So for the look, feel to seem coherent, not just sorta bits, bits, pieces of concept, technology or whatever or fashion, then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sorta can visualize.",1
"Industrial Designer: Has to change channels, has to change vole, but in like specifics, right, which one of the basics are you trying to target.",1
"User Interface: I think the volume was usually above each other, because you go higher, down.",0
"Project Manager: So if it were flat on the bottom, then had the sorta grips on the side here I guess, then flat And then we have the problem with the hinge.",1
Project Manager: It is innovative.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, maybe it should have a light so that we can, we can just recognise where it is.",1
"Industrial Designer: Different pen widths, how do you do that?",1
User Interface: So I do not know if that would still be possible to have you know in plastic.,0
Project Manager: What is the price to p to produce?,0
"Marketing: yeah, this is my report on trend watching.",1
"Project Manager: Right, time for presentations then.",1
"Industrial Designer: This is just one thing I wanted to mention, show you that I just I just found this, that our company developed a s a seven f seven fingers or I will just.",0
Project Manager: Here we go.,0
"User Interface: it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something, it turns the TV on like, turn the TV on, i turns comes on, but it is not that.",1
Industrial Designer: That is the first slide.,0
Project Manager: have you got a presentation to make?,1
"User Interface: Mmhmm, yeah, that would be useful.",0
"Industrial Designer: including the integrated circuit, which is also known as the chip.",1
"Project Manager: you know yellow it is nice, bright, with the buttons being grey or black.",1
"Project Manager: right? Well one colour for the case, one colour for the buttons.",1
User Interface: So in terms of in terms of economics it is probably better to have pushbuttons.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, we have to look at mobile phones, that is right.",0
Industrial Designer: We should probably just use conventional batteries.,1
Project Manager: Like a wheel on your mouse.,1
"Industrial Designer: The volume, channel buttons, you need you obviously need those.",0
"User Interface: which if it works perfectly well I see no point in improving on if it works,",1
"Project Manager: up volume, yeah, I would have thought so.",0
Project Manager: The first kickoff meeting.,1
Marketing: But I'd have to look into that a little more.,1
"Marketing: At two million units, we have to have a profit of twentyfive Euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit Eu Euro profit.",1
User Interface: Th this is the base.,0
Industrial Designer: Or some kind of rubber around it.,1
"User Interface: Kind of, maybe more like a PDA kind of, just hand held, like,",1
"Industrial Designer: And solar cells, I dunno about that.",1
"Project Manager: I'm sorry, that eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy.",1
"Industrial Designer: Or grandma as well, you know it is like what is the mute button.",0
Project Manager: No you can ch push zero.,0
Industrial Designer: Got decisions to make there.,0
User Interface: cause it is I think it is m much easier to use a plastic or a rubber rather than wood.,0
"Marketing: and they did not the one meeting did not always follow on for the other one, you know, sort of we had things thrown in at the second meeting where, you know, you'd looked at the remote controls, seen the curviness, but in the first one you'd also looked at some remote controls, looked at the buttons,",1
"Marketing: The first one, which seems to be the most important one, is that it has to be fancy, it has to have a fancy look, feel.",1
Industrial Designer: I do not think that is quite up to date with what we are looking for here.,0
"Project Manager: and the third thing that they wanna make sure that their that the corporate image is being maintained, that the corporate colour, design are being used on the product, so that it is easy that they can be easily identified as a product of the company, that there is no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out.",0
"Marketing: I personally think, because I d I do not think i maybe it is easy to use, it has to be easy to find right away.",1
Marketing: that is m that is better too.,0
Project Manager: But how expensive it is?,0
Industrial Designer: I it it is just the way that the th the way it is ac it is actually built.,0
"Marketing: Yeah, there we go.",0
User Interface: It is not really gonna.,0
"Industrial Designer: I guess it was a fairly small group,",1
User Interface: Then you also have to have different languages if we go international.,1
Industrial Designer: That is a good idea.,0
Project Manager: Do you have it upside down or.,0
"Marketing: So, remove one of them.",0
"Project Manager: maybe try to mix them these two concepts together, just in one, do a remote control with solar energy, batteries, with lev low level chips, wood.",1
"Project Manager: But, from now on I wo not use my pen anymore, so will be p just ordinary keyboard.",1
"Marketing: cause it is only a low market, it is a cheapend remote control, we ca not beat modern functionality, we might we will be able to beat them on th the look of it, th the design of it but that is not a big seller, if they are not just going to buy a new remote control just 'cause it looks pretty, they have to actually need it as well.",1
"Project Manager: right, well next up then, because we have done finance, is the project evaluation.",1
"Marketing: So in that way we need not to d have different shape mobiles everything, we will just design casings fruit shape.",1
"Marketing: the screen, the brightness.",0
Project Manager: And what is the channel choose? Where do we put that? Still on the bottom.,0
"User Interface: It is a it is great, it is a good idea, but for our budget, for the thing we are trying to go for eas easy to use, it is not the thing we should go for, I think.",0
"User Interface: Otherwise you have all those teletext, perhaps teletext not,",0
"Project Manager: well I was going to say clapping, digital telephones, for example, one unit has of course you have to have that base unit, somewhere where there is a button, but maybe it is a button that you attach to the TV.",1
User Interface: you just get off that.,0
"Project Manager: Is we will meet in another half an hour or so, I'd like the Industrial Designer to get ge think about what needs to be done, like what the basic function of it.",1
"Marketing: Yeah, well we could admit to the single curve, could not we?",1
"Marketing: Mmhmm, what is this here?",0
Marketing: So you could imagine that the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station.,1
Marketing: that is my job.,0
Marketing: So I think we could definitely eliminate or somehow combine a lot of the functions into one button.,1
Industrial Designer: So that is the end of it.,0
"Project Manager: So thanks for coming for the meeting first of all, we have a long time, just twentyfive minutes to discuss about this project, the project initiation.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, yeah, sure.",0
"Marketing: No, I use te teletext every day, I think.",1
User Interface: The extra two are for having or giving an option for having more than one channel.,0
"Industrial Designer: There might be something that you can do in the circuit board, the chip to make it make a noise or something, but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon.",1
"Project Manager: Channel up, down.",0
User Interface: I yeah I suggest here.,0
"User Interface: so, that is pretty much it, an I do not know if you guys have any questions or.",0
"Industrial Designer: the energy source is connected to the infrared button, but the infrared button works only via the chip, the subcomponent to the switch there is a switch between these.",0
"Marketing: so, I will give more importance to the look, feel than rather than the.",0
"Industrial Designer: That might be constrained because that you might need to power a microphone, you might need to power other things, so that is one perhaps constraint there.",1
"Project Manager: Well I will start just with another presentation, so then we can look at th at the agenda for this meeting.",0
"User Interface: And th maybe two others, I dunno.",1
"Industrial Designer: So you'd have something like where you'd shout out, where is the remote, it will shout back, I'm here, or something.",1
Project Manager: We have about forty minutes.,0
"Project Manager: But what I request, keep Ed in the loop, in between your meeting, Christine meeting, because he should know what is happening.",1
User Interface: I'm gonna erase my name there.,0
"Industrial Designer: Or curved at one end, flat on the top, because I I'm not sure if it is flat on both the sides, then w much easy would it be to reach for buttons, etcetera.",1
Project Manager: It is not that in China it is different?,0
User Interface: Well maybe not a solar remote but instead what about if we had like a power cradle?,0
Marketing: Yes but it is not the biggest part of the market.,0
"Project Manager: Just a very thin sorta sheet for a grip, sorta thing or for.",0
Project Manager: Could we could take out the curve.,1
"Industrial Designer: In fact, we should sell through Amazon,",1
"Marketing: I mean, we have a option in the remote control.",1
Project Manager: So it is a three.,0
"User Interface: Well yeah, I prefer to use it only for TV, n not to give too many options, if possible, the buttons should give a dr direct action, not first select.",0
"Project Manager: I just have to there is a few little bits, pieces I have to write down, but Take your headsets off, kick back, smoke 'em if you got 'em.",0
Marketing: Because people are silly.,0
"Project Manager: Well, then we have two dollars less profit.",1
"Industrial Designer: right I'm responsible for working design, this is basically the inside going on of the remote control.",1
"User Interface: Ask our R, D department.",0
"Industrial Designer: It is Yes, but they are mass production.",0
"Project Manager: So our target group, we are saying, fifteen to thirty five?",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, just like he said with the with the a screen which you can write, also a kind of voting mechanism.",0
User Interface: So our experience of leadership was not really as much as yours.,0
"User Interface: For kids they want simply the s similarit for the old people they want simplicity,",1
"Marketing: So this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just the finding it basically, instead of clapping why not just be ask.",1
Project Manager: Just need to know so I can write it down.,0
"User Interface: And, like they are more of a companion than cats.",0
User Interface: Or we could say it.,0
"Industrial Designer: Well that that is just it with the covers, you are sort of tricking 'em into continuing to spend their money on our products without making 'em feel like they are being ripped off having to buy a new product.",0
User Interface: We made three for you.,1
Project Manager: But that that is that is your area of expertise.,0
Marketing: What is that? Look more Looks more like a campfire.,0
"Project Manager: Well, according to Ruud, people do not use all the extra features very often.",1
Project Manager: Can you read that? Almost.,0
Project Manager: It looks more like a pineapple.,1
User Interface: Let is Let is take.,0
Industrial Designer: I dunno if it is the right point to take it up.,0
"Project Manager: that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consers, wide age range, not limiting anyone.",1
"Project Manager: Like you take just take your freedom, use a trendy interface that you design for us.",0
Industrial Designer: I think that is a good idea.,0
"Marketing: Volume, then power.",0
Industrial Designer: Because that is the basis you are building on.,0
Marketing: As long as there is not a big pause between the t hitting the two buttons.,0
Industrial Designer: And I think that is what we w.,0
"Marketing: We can plan further, I think.",1
Marketing: and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this.,1
"Industrial Designer: It would have been even more fancy, but we decided not to, because if we use a doublecurved case, we could not use solar.",0
"Marketing: Teletext, now I'm not too clear on what that is.",1
Project Manager: That is Around eighty percent.,0
Project Manager: but I thought in a few meetings earlier we tried to keep it simple.,0
"Industrial Designer: What if we gave it a charger? And on the charger, just like a phone, like you get a portable phone, it is got a charger, if you d leave your phone somewhere, you push the button to find it, it finds th the phone beeps for you.",1
"User Interface: No, I just wondering whether that you had any sort of.",0
"Project Manager: So, who will be the responsible for the functional design? Any volunteer?",0
"Marketing: So the first one was really very far below budget, would you want to take the price down of the end product according to that or just have the high profit on it? 'Cause if we are only going to make it for eight Euros then we have a.",1
Project Manager: We move along to the project finance.,1
Industrial Designer: Mine is a bit more skinny.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, but it that does not have to remind you, you know, like explicitly of s our f of a of a specific piece of fruit, but just, you know, like the round curves.",1
"Project Manager: complete the final questionnaire, meeting summary.",0
"Marketing: No, I think her presentation was good, she really explored all the options.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, what the which channels the viewer.",0
Project Manager: That is nice.,0
Project Manager: And you will have in thirty minutes individual work.,1
"Industrial Designer: So it not only in the colours of the LEDs, that we want something to keep it visible at all times, or.",1
User Interface: To look at similar devices.,1
Marketing: yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others.,1
User Interface: You can try out the eraser now.,1
Marketing: because it is not reachable for twenty five Euros.,1
"Marketing: M but it really has to fit into the budget, so I guess we just have to adjust things to get it i in the Which is fair enough.",0
"User Interface: whereas the right remote is much simpler, it looks much more user friendly.",1
"Marketing: It is reasonable, I think, yeah.",0
"Marketing: Maybe there is a supplement for that, no?",0
Project Manager: So that will be that will be good.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, but si w when taken in account the situation, I think we performed pretty well.",0
User Interface: Not more than two colours I think.,1
Industrial Designer: There you go.,0
Industrial Designer: Maybe the spongy feel is something we could think about.,1
Project Manager: See you in thirty minutes.,0
"Project Manager: Welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings, it looks like we have done a good job here, we will just go through the final the final details.",0
User Interface: so these we have to work it out.,0
Marketing: That the Excel thing is pretty cool.,1
User Interface: I dunno I think we had a fair bit of creativity.,1
User Interface: Well have we confirmed that we are gonna go ahead with a touch screen.,1
"Project Manager: and we are now with four people,",0
"Industrial Designer: S Lottery numbers, sport scores.",0
"Industrial Designer: For the interface I think that we can ach achieve all the desired functionalities by s just using rubber buttons, simple buttons, th thus this allow to use a regular chip that are well cheaper.",0
"Industrial Designer: So to get a good recogni recognising system, it is a costly thing, I think.",1
Project Manager: we decided chip on print would be used.,0
Project Manager: We said plastic or rubber.,1
Project Manager: I'm a excellent Project Manager.,1
User Interface: So were we aiming for a certain target on that scale?,0
"Marketing: furthermore material, that is your part, should be very strong.",1
"Project Manager: And do you have any any idea of the trend the trend in domain, what it should not it should look like, or things like that?",1
Project Manager: it is by pressing on blank.,0
"Marketing: No, but just a wooden look.",0
"Project Manager: So, our new project is about we need design a remote control for television set, so, which has to be original, trendy, userfriendly.",1
"Project Manager: How should we supply the thing with energy, how are we going to do it with separate docking station, then put in it.",0
"Marketing: And does it meet our like demographic need sort of for international appeal, that whole thing? Just that it would se serve our audience.",1
User Interface: You just click anywhere.,0
Marketing: when we threw it open to the field yeah.,0
Industrial Designer: You do not want your three feet huge LCD dis display in your living room that is hanging from the wall to be controlled with something like that.,0
"Industrial Designer: then download it, it is then start a new one.",0
"Project Manager: So I guess we have to look into the, like, the programming, how this how they actually programme these things, if that is.",1
Industrial Designer: The volume settings.,0
"User Interface: That is very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up, so they came up with something like this, curled up, so here,",1
"User Interface: It is named appropriately, you just could not see the name.",0
"Industrial Designer: So I guess three things, cost, complexity, the size.",1
Industrial Designer: Let is start over again then.,0
"Marketing: Cause if people are left handed they want to use the other hand,",0
"User Interface: The buttons, in a lot of cases, are tiny.",1
Marketing: So we give ourself a three or something.,1
"Project Manager: So that would require a transmitter maybe attached to the TV, just so that it says find me, what, a basically a small microphone on the actual unit, can maybe hide it in the base.",0
Industrial Designer: So th so the regular chip.,1
User Interface: For better want of a better word.,0
"Marketing: I often lose my remote control, the back of the couch, some place, even if it is not lost permanently, it takes me a few minutes to find it.",0
Industrial Designer: if you lose if you lose the.,0
"User Interface: like this s style thing where you c have up, down, left, right.",1
Project Manager: I will clear one of these things for you.,0
"Project Manager: Well, w when we only use basic functions, we have the possibility to make the buttons larger.",1
Industrial Designer: I think that is the best way to do it.,0
Project Manager: we should take some practice.,0
Marketing: On this scale the LCD remote control.,0
"Project Manager: When you put on remote, you see a kind of a just like when you telephone, you see a little animation.",1
Project Manager: follow on with Helen? Yeah please.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, but we are designing just remote control.",1
Industrial Designer: more information about the costs.,1
"Industrial Designer: A user interface controls the chip, basically that is the casing, the buttons, accordingly the messages as well.",1
Marketing: so either having the buttons so you can feel the difference between them or if they if they light up or something.,1
"Project Manager: Yeah, that is This is this is good.",0
"User Interface: I think that a single function remote control would be preferable, because it is easier to use.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, but because it has the regular controls, li as you can see in the screen now, you do not have all the other options always on your screen.",0
"Marketing: we found, in order of importance, people want the remote control to look cool more than they want it to be cool.",1
"Project Manager: But it does not say anything about it,",0
"Project Manager: Yeah, well we already s discussed that, huh, the LCD.",1
"Marketing: We have got the features, we have the characteristics, we have the I do not know what we would call the other part what we call you know the the corp corporate Help me.",0
Project Manager: It looks very cheap if you make it.,0
"Project Manager: no, younger than forty.",1
"Project Manager: You have got the sample sensor, sample speaker, which is your big item.",1
Marketing: looks like it is going to be a dachshund or something.,0
"User Interface: I was thinking not actually scroll, like a like mouse scroll, but you know, a I ca not quite d describe it.",1
"User Interface: So, is it very usable? That is what I'm looking at.",0
"Project Manager: Well, but you have got the company logo on there, which would effectively be a stickon badge.",1
"Project Manager: And if you have a touch screen in it, it is definitely too fragile fragile.",1
Industrial Designer: So final design.,1
"Industrial Designer: For the components design, next step is basically the way the remote is gonna work is still the same idea as before.",1
Industrial Designer: The end product thingy.,0
Industrial Designer: You could make it just a regular scroll wheel.,1
User Interface: mainly speak recognition.,1
"Industrial Designer: On the on the left,",1
Industrial Designer: this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint so.,0
"Industrial Designer: As or as hearing is concerned, we can have some at some place,",1
Project Manager: So with that I think it is best if I hand over to you.,0
Marketing: But that should also be with f should be also with LCD screen.,1
Project Manager: Maybe you could use your remote as a phone.,0
User Interface: Or what if it looks like a pen?,0
Marketing: I guess Real Reaction did some market research.,0
Project Manager: but then it is very functional to indicate which what device you are controlling.,0
Industrial Designer: Are we going into kind of novelty factors here.,1
User Interface: would like to share something which I did here.,0
"User Interface: that is definitely a very important factor, especially to users who are gonna be buying the thing, then using it almost on an daily basis in a lot of cases, I think.",1
"Industrial Designer: We need a chip that works well with the user interface, that is not too complicated.",1
Marketing: I was the only one who get it.,0
Project Manager: I probably have already opened it here.,0
User Interface: Advanced chip was for spee Yeah.,0
"Marketing: But people are often enough looking at the help,",1
"Project Manager: We have about ten minutes left, in which time we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts.",0
"Industrial Designer: Otherwise it will not too advanced,",0
"Marketing: So I mean I we will put three, but I think we actually reached our goal.",1
"User Interface: You know, just like right inside there.",0
"Industrial Designer: If we do a voiceactivated locator, though, we are gonna be looking at a more substantial chip.",1
"Project Manager: and but about the price of adding this solar battery, would it be something really that will increase the price of production more,",1
Industrial Designer: Does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user.,1
"Project Manager: about all the meetings, what we have decided, a r a report of this day.",1
"User Interface: Well it depends when you say functional, do you mean it does what we want it to do, or d does what it does, you know, can it make you coffee?",1
"Project Manager: Our agenda is, as before, for me to open the meeting, for us to go over the previous minutes, then for the two of you to present your prototype, for you to g Sarah present the evaluation criteria.",1
"User Interface: When you go to the sofa, take your control, point it to the TV,",1
"Marketing: No, I know, but I have to evaluate it.",0
Project Manager: so let is go with a touch screen with some kind of you know with some kind of cutting edge battery technology.,1
"Project Manager: so I th think you know the idea of a rechargeable one is unless you are really high tech, it sort of just recharges itself if it is n by, you know, magnetic waves or whatever, if it.",1
"Industrial Designer: It is in th in in the base, yeah.",1
"Project Manager: So, but le let is decide first about the components concept, interface concept, if is acceptable for both of you, what Ed was talking.",1
"User Interface: My personal preferences would be like, as already marketing department, they want something to do with fruit so I would not say the design should be like a fruit, but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours, like the vibrant colours, red chilli.",1
"User Interface: so y so we might do we might want to do like a another m model another version, which is like exactly the mirror image of this one.",1
User Interface: Then make it th three.,1
"Project Manager: But that is just half, we should also consider look,",1
Project Manager: No maybe the shift button is stuck in.,0
"Marketing: I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful,",1
"Industrial Designer: Those are the technological colours actually,",1
"User Interface: I mean you say you wanted the corporate colours, but they do not say you know if we can use any other colours at all or.",0
"Marketing: Like so sort of like how do you I mean one way of looking at it would be, well the people producing television sets, maybe they have to buy remote controls.",1
"Project Manager: our control is only going to be for TV, it is not going to be a combined control, which limits you know all of the different things that it limits the cost for us,",1
Project Manager: It has to be advanced.,0
Project Manager: Cause that seems a little more useful.,0
Industrial Designer: I mean it just seems realistic that the remote control market is not the kind of thing which takes in those kinds of fashion trends.,0
"Project Manager: On the LCD screen, you mean?",1
Industrial Designer: But you still have the problem about the television itself.,0
"User Interface: th the buttons part would be a set of buttons for choosing devices, a set of buttons for special navigation in space,",1
Industrial Designer: and the possibilities are very limited.,0
"User Interface: whereas having something like, I dunno, steel or titanium is not really economically viable.",1
"Project Manager: And for the speech recognition part, if we want to incorporate that, we need a microphone.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, Or are we making a slide open, like underneath? Or fold open? I do not know.",1
"User Interface: often, you need to know specific button sequences to get certain functionalities done, which you do not necessarily always remember, especially if it is a functionality that you do not use very often.",1
"Project Manager: And we wo not include a pen, or something to point,",1
"User Interface: Well, probably the only thing is a banana that I can think of,",1
"Project Manager: So we make one for the volume, one for the channel.",1
"Marketing: And so yeah when we have a cradle, when we have some kind of design, so what I'm saying is, from my perspective, I do not have a product to market right now.",1
"Industrial Designer: Or, a more handshaped remote control, with scroll, without LCD.",1
"Marketing: top European fashion trend that I read about says there is this emerging theme of fruit, vegetables,",0
Marketing: like if it had a symbol on it.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah I have heard I have seen the barcode design before,",0
"Marketing: I think if you have the button at the right, I do not think you can find the option button that easy.",0
Marketing: Wh you know like for instance take the iPod.,0
Marketing: I We will go for a three.,0
"Marketing: So, come back to the presentation now.",1
"Project Manager: it does not matter, just start with the.",0
"Project Manager: but I do not s I personally do not think this is comfortable to sit there, like it is an awkward position.",0
"Project Manager: as suggested yellow with black buttons with the company logo, a slogan, image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us.",0
"Project Manager: b da is you mean on the plastic, or?",0
Industrial Designer: I give it a one.,1
"Marketing: I think the thing is, so if someone just wants to turn on their TV, put on a channel, then it should be easier to use than any other remote,",1
"Marketing: Yeah, get in there.",0
"User Interface: So you could have the name of the programme, you could have the start time you know where it is up to.",0
"Project Manager: Fir the first thing is th the functional design, that is very important.",1
"Marketing: And the modern one you you type search, the LED began to blink.",0
Project Manager: W that why we have the solar ti yeah.,1
Marketing: Even then our product is going to be very good.,0
Project Manager: Yeah that is our last step.,0
"Marketing: Yeah, I think the spinning wheel is definitely very now.",1
Industrial Designer: maybe we use this button for the.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, depending on the expense of it.",1
"User Interface: So, as you can see, it is a very simple design,",1
Industrial Designer: Well maybe it could be a universal design.,1
"Project Manager: We could use that as an alternative to programming in times, things like that, is that.",1
Project Manager: that is the one that goes like this.,0
"Marketing: so, we are using the criteria for a seven point scale, so we need to discuss how we feel.",0
Marketing: It does not work.,0
"Project Manager: The one with dash, that signal gi, when y whe when you do not push another button on the remote control within five seconds, then the remote control gives a signal for channel one.",1
"Industrial Designer: Well, if you if you have the l LCD screen, you can you can have a small logo i at the bottom.",1
"Industrial Designer: So, yeah I ran out of time so I could not do this one as fun as the last one.",0
Project Manager: but then we still have the thing of the shape.,0
"User Interface: Well, my name is Iain.",0
"Industrial Designer: It does make sense from maybe the design point of view 'cause you have more complicated characters like European languages, then you need more buttons.",1
"Industrial Designer: So for my part I will check the prices the the prices difference of what to use, where to use, s, so on.",1
"Industrial Designer: Well, mayb well, m me neither.",0
"User Interface: And you have page numbers like for the menu, you press the page numbers with your remote, it, it will come up.",0
Marketing: current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall.,1
"Project Manager: The kinetic thing, can we just skip it,",1
"Project Manager: and you need to come up with some kind of plan, how we are going to do the your sales plan, th.",1
"User Interface: well, during the meeting I showed you the concept of placing the buttons on top, usable with your thumb, the menu structure, if necessary, with your other hand, so it is just gonna hold it easily.",1
"Marketing: sorry, four million of 'em, but I think if w if we market it as not as not well this you c you could either market it as the point of view we could have the two we could have parallel marketing s schemes where you have got one where it appeals to people that want to have the new device that looks cool, is fashionable.",0
Industrial Designer: So I give it a four.,0
User Interface: But I thought it was just completely pointless.,1
"Industrial Designer: Or a find a finding function,",0
Project Manager: I think that is well done everybody.,0
User Interface: But we lose about ninety percent of those options.,1
Industrial Designer: So it is t I think it is really easy to use.,1
Industrial Designer: Do we still have the time? I just wonder.,0
"Industrial Designer: Something like that,",1
"Project Manager: So we are looking to sell internationally, not just in Europe.",1
"Industrial Designer: H here is just the module for the kids, th if the parents want to watch TV, up they come up with their modules,",1
Project Manager: So this the opening we will We have to design a new television remote control.,0
"Marketing: you know, well maybe we have to move along.",0
"Industrial Designer: I guess that is more in the sense of small, slim in terms of comfortable not so small you ca not, you know like a phone or something, too small phone.",1
"Industrial Designer: So you ca not see the alarm, but it would light up.",0
User Interface: And it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic.,1
"User Interface: Yeah, but I do not think the colours black, yellow go well together.",0
"Marketing: I had a talk to the design people about this, but having a remote that is tactile, that feels different, that would be really cool.",1
Project Manager: I think that would be you.,0
"Marketing: how ma the colours like l she told, is that all the colours we add or.",0
Project Manager: No porn channel for children.,0
User Interface: So I think that can be all kind of shapes.,1
"User Interface: Because one solution for this ch changing channels is to see a smary of all channels, some preview of all channels, then you can.",0
"Industrial Designer: And also the bleep, when what I told you about when you lost it, you push a button, then you hear bleep, we will find it.",1
Industrial Designer: And you can have them at home.,0
Industrial Designer: I copied mine before I sent it over.,0
Marketing: The remote control is innovative.,1
"Project Manager: Nah, the televi the television would have to be a Bluetooth compatible, basically.",0
Industrial Designer: I'm not so good at drawing.,0
Marketing: So that the screen is more.,0
"Marketing: my findings from this is that, you know, small is beautiful.",1
Industrial Designer: Maybe just a menu button to use it on our televisions.,1
"Marketing: Right, I have been looking at some trends in sort of basically fashion on top of doing the research into the remote control market the one that is the one I talked about last time, that we'd sort of asked people about remote controls, what was good about them, what was bad, what they used.",1
Industrial Designer: We may not need it.,1
"Project Manager: the individual presentations, I th Roo or Sebastian, who of you would like to start?",0
"Marketing: Shake it, the buttons fall off.",0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, so if you you receive an email about that, can you post it in the or should not we post that in our projects mail folder.",0
User Interface: Well that is a just simple PowerPoint mockup I want to m make it more as dynamic for you so I will draw there.,0
"User Interface: Every fourth, you know.",0
"Project Manager: No, that would not n no.",0
"Industrial Designer: I suppose, if we are he heading to have it, like make a huge profit out of this, it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing.",1
Marketing: We can put in our recommendations.,1
Marketing: This is very ugly.,1
Industrial Designer: Seven to seven to at least well some three millimetres or something.,1
"Project Manager: If anything does not look right, just say it to me then.",1
User Interface: You have the same message of Windows cannot.,0
Project Manager: And if you use less buttons.,1
"Project Manager: It is the box below it,",0
Industrial Designer: That is no problem.,0
"Marketing: And maybe that spatially divides it, so it is like if you are looki if you are trying to get the TV on that is, you know, like the top thing on the remote, I dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we are gonna make it, but if it is like all the TV stuff was here,",1
"User Interface: so it is one that is got lots of buttons, it is fully featured, everything you might possibly want to do is there, you know, it is got forward, backwards, up, down, channel numbers, volume, freeze frame.",1
"User Interface: Yeah maybe we can just like on cell phones those well you can you can put on them,",0
"Marketing: And another function I will think of switch to your media centre, because that is getting very popular.",0
"Industrial Designer: these, they are all different options, they are all separate, apart from the chip, which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple, a regular, advanced.",1
Industrial Designer: That is important.,0
Project Manager: It is important that the corporate design image is going to be in the remote.,0
"Marketing: it is probably just I dunno if it is worth getting into, but just in that we want this to be stylish, should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid, because I have seen there is lots of devices out there that instead of taking your standard nine square grid, they have it sort of stylized or in different concept that.",1
"Project Manager: And, as a sort of teambuilding moment, I, I'd like us to, try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal, the charac characteristics of that animal.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, but y you could you could make 'em like blue, transparent.",0
"Marketing: Are the younger people going to buy the remote control or the elderly people? And then tho that section we are going to focus, adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user section.",1
Project Manager: It is very difficult to do it.,0
"Marketing: no, trend watching.",0
"User Interface: avoid too many buttons, also one of the things that people have used is a slide button, like you have on a mouse, that possibly we could use that on the sides for vole, for example, have the slide button on the side,",1
Marketing: So this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv in our mark means in take in designing our rem remote controls.,0
"Project Manager: Yes, we could.",0
User Interface: but this interface are kind of confusing.,1
"Project Manager: For elderly people they can thin, I wanna have subtitles,",0
Marketing: So it would be nice if we have one for all.,1
"Industrial Designer: And this is, this is with the curved that I mean.",1
"Marketing: Yeah, already having the formatted stuff helped a lot.",1
Industrial Designer: I would go for four.,0
Industrial Designer: something like that.,1
"Industrial Designer: With plastic, as I understand it, you can use any form.",1
"Marketing: Well I mean of course, I mean.",0
Marketing: Some of the good stuff we got.,1
"Marketing: Yeah, otherwise all your yeah.",0
Industrial Designer: and it just feels different.,0
Marketing: The microphone is a feature.,1
"User Interface: No it is people in Milan, in Paris that are gonna buy it.",0
"Industrial Designer: below forty five, above.",0
"Project Manager: Yeah, in the middle.",1
"User Interface: Well, as I said earlier I think the LCD screen should be positioned at the lower end of the remote.",0
"Marketing: No, this is like I said that we have to be discussed between all of us, we will go from there.",0
"Industrial Designer: The user interf interface communicates with the chip, so I will basic go over to the.",1
"Marketing: but you have a catch there, asse that if you want to go to if you are watching channel two, if you want to go to channel ninety nine, then.",1
"Industrial Designer: But I think that, you know, switching from one country to another will be a problem, so although y.",1
"Project Manager: So for anybody need any help, for time being, on this subjects, so please come back to me,",1
"Marketing: The company is about our th their own fashion, their own style.",1
User Interface: And obviously the simplest thing that a remote control does is it just change the change the channel.,0
User Interface: so attain the functionality of a complicated device but use a simple formatted display for the user to work with.,0
Industrial Designer: We cannot change the chip which controls the infrared lamp.,1
Project Manager: and now you can erase.,0
Industrial Designer: now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller.,1
Industrial Designer: So the method.,0
"Project Manager: For volume, or a channel.",1
Project Manager: Check your mail.,1
"Industrial Designer: well it is better to place it here th than here, for instance.",0
Project Manager: I will put the minutes in the project project docent folder.,0
Project Manager: So I think it is four.,1
"Project Manager: now the new project requirements, I will just show them.",1
Marketing: But we have to take care of our children also if they means if children catch hold of your or if they chew it should not be too harmful.,1
User Interface: just a base station next to the TV is the best possibility.,1
Project Manager: Well look on your.,1
"Marketing: You were not like a dictating leader, so that was always good.",1
"Marketing: also with with buttons, a thing called RSI, so wrist sense.",1
"User Interface: I mean titanium would be great, but I thin it might be a bit too expensive, too inda spacey.",1
Marketing: O or we could like take off this.,0
"Industrial Designer: And so you functions what for the buttons, scrolling function could be very beneficial to us instead of actual buttons themselves.",1
"Marketing: with transport, promotion, labour, because we hav gi included the promotion in the cost, transport for the material to the stores or whatever how however we are gonna break this down between our retailers.",1
Project Manager: So that is something to keep in mind while you are designing.,0
"Marketing: But, price obviously we have to talk about.",1
User Interface: this is actually hard to do.,0
"Project Manager: We have another thirty minutes, so then we are going to meet again.",0
"Marketing: No, you will ha have to open it up from elsewhere.",0
"Marketing: And elderly people, our market, are less interested in nice features, but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls.",0
User Interface: I th I do still think it needs to be something that is ultimately onehanded.,1
"Project Manager: Well, they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet.",1
"User Interface: So well the approach is that basically the idea is to send a message to the TV set, as Mael has pointed, it will be decoded by the TV, usually we it is easier to have keys or buttons with which people can press, then changing a button will basically change the message which is being sent to the TV,",1
"Marketing: So if we want something strong, sturdy, I say stay with plastic or titani, but if we go with spongy, we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want, it does not matter, it is spongy material, it is not gonna break, you know.",1
"User Interface: There is the graphical user interface, which emphasises the use of pictures for output, a pointing device, for example a mouse for input control.",1
Marketing: we will say yes it is one?,0
Industrial Designer: I was Because.,0
"Project Manager: this is our agenda, we will do some stuff, get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other.",1
"Marketing: Yeah, I think that is a lot, so we have to make a beautiful remote control.",1
User Interface: Like the iPod.,0
User Interface: Yeah no it is too expensive.,0
"Industrial Designer: This, you know, very enlighted colours, you know.",0
Project Manager: How to use the scroll wheel.,1
"User Interface: So that eliminates all the complicated documentation,",1
"User Interface: So this would be an example of bad layout, where you have volume up, volume down, but they have a V on both of them, so.",1
"User Interface: Well it lasts it would last for several hours on its own power, but when you are done with it you put it back in the cradle.",1
Project Manager: Then we have the case material supplements.,1
"User Interface: And it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used so we might consider that, supposedly.",1
"User Interface: And this can be all sorts of medsa messages, turn it on, turn it off, change the channel, adjust volume, that kind of thing.",1
Project Manager: So that is clear.,0
"User Interface: It is really but do you need a screen then, do you have to have a screen then?",1
Project Manager: what kind of animal is that then?,0
Project Manager: this would this would be cutting the speech recognition.,1
Marketing: current market trends.,0
"Industrial Designer: If we do not use a scroll, then we can use the simple chip.",1
"User Interface: No, swapping is if example you are you are watching the second channel, then you go to the tenth channel, if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap, this button.",0
"User Interface: The first one is the speech recogniser, again it is detachable or addon.",1
"Industrial Designer: Because of the budget, yeah.",1
User Interface: and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control.,1
Marketing: it is not a thing that people are looking for.,0
User Interface: By just putting the volume on the side.,1
"Project Manager: and be you know, has been good communication going on.",1
"Marketing: but it does feel all cold, slimy.",0
Marketing: Paper size A four.,0
"Project Manager: And the simple way to do it would be to have a battery, to have your sample sensor speaker,",0
"User Interface: I do not actually think we need the the neric keypad because if you m because one of the menus that we could have available v via the LCD is one where you scroll through channels, so if there is something f, be bear in mind since this is not meant to work for.",0
Project Manager: I try to organise it by these three.,0
"User Interface: Yes, go, finish up, I will see you at lunch.",0
Project Manager: We are doing just the television.,1
"Marketing: Basically, what I did was I went through all the like user requirements, things that we have done, we have worked on, like made a list of them.",0
Industrial Designer: Then we have one Euro thirty for the whole docking station.,1
"User Interface: it is not the purpose to be handy, it is.",0
"Project Manager: I ca not see tha Although, th I mean to be to be sure they have got I mean they are going crazy with the LCD technology now,",1
"User Interface: And we determined that will not be no buttons, but only an LCD screen, so I had to look on that.",1
Marketing: but you have got a lot less control over it.,0
"Marketing: if we only have twelve Pounds fifty, twelve Euros, not even twelve Pounds.",0
Industrial Designer: And then the front is made of plastic.,1
Industrial Designer: where you manually charge up the power.,0
"Project Manager: and you say one for this, you find yours, like you said, saying the same thing over, over, over.",1
Project Manager: you skipped one.,0
"Marketing: Cool, so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though,",1
"Project Manager: I mean it should be very intuitive,",0
"Project Manager: Faster as well, I think.",0
Marketing: I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top.,1
Project Manager: And you could place the indica th the signals the.,0
Project Manager: or I could put it in the shared folder or something.,1
"User Interface: Yeah, alternate energy source, like win wind power or.",0
"Industrial Designer: What do you think, LCD is a major feature, or?",0
User Interface: That is but it is not.,0
Marketing: No? But it is smallish.,1
"Marketing: So, so this is what people find annoying about remote controls.",1
Marketing: It says on that email but it.,0
"Marketing: It is more like if you lost it, it is down the sofa sometime, you can yell at it it will just change it, you can look for it later, yeah.",1
Project Manager: Now we have a few new product requirements.,1
Marketing: fifty per cents of users say they only use ten per cents of but of the buttons in the in the remote control.,0
Project Manager: But you definitely get a specific instruction.,1
"Marketing: Well y you could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts, of course.",0
Marketing: The plus thing needs to be worked on.,1
"Industrial Designer: We are not developing this product for a specific vendor, are we?",0
Project Manager: Then it is just apple so sort of.,0
Project Manager: I think we can go ahead with what we have.,1
Industrial Designer: Because it went a bit fast.,1
Industrial Designer: Ma on most on most remote controls it is red.,0
"Industrial Designer: and the shape, maybe we will just make it kinda mix, match type of shape or.",0
User Interface: Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use.,1
Marketing: I think we should make it universal.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, do we need buttons?",0
"User Interface: I think maybe one option is to have you know a little flipopen door that that you have hidden most of the time, but contains the extra buttons like, say, the nber buttons for instance.",1
Industrial Designer: Most of them will intuitively pick it up though.,0
Project Manager: So Then it depends on the cost.,1
"Project Manager: And then press, what? F FN, F eight.",0
"Marketing: If we have enough place, then we can do that.",0
Project Manager: It that that is what I call trendy.,0
"User Interface: just when you are one, you go to two, you can or if you go to five, you can go back to one with that button.",1
User Interface: The first is that it is fuzzy.,1
Marketing: We have to aim at a mu at the main audience.,1
Project Manager: That is us.,0
"User Interface: And, things like teletext, put them in the menu.",1
"Project Manager: we have push button interface, so that is inexpensive.",0
Project Manager: Let is hope the pen holds out.,0
"Marketing: I ha I have not thought of any particular fruit, but the general aspect of the of the remote control may could remind some kind of vegetable, some kind of instead of vegetable, some natur natural object or something.",1
"Industrial Designer: So it requires the use of LCD probably, to tell you.",1
"Project Manager: So we are gonna have like a menu button,",0
"Marketing: If you are watching an foreign movie, you get subtitles sometimes.",1
"Marketing: I mean it depends what sort of business you are in, I guess.",0
"Industrial Designer: I think that this will be like a scroll wheel, actually.",0
"Project Manager: Well, there is some.",0
"Industrial Designer: so probably voice recognition is kind of important, right?",0
"Marketing: And so people say that they typically lose it, as you yourself know, because you probably lose your remote control all the time,",1
"Marketing: so it is not used very often, but people still find it relevant.",0
"Industrial Designer: At the moment we have just got the simple chip, which costs one.",1
"Industrial Designer: We have our up, down buttons, which are also gonna be our channel selectors, we have our little menu button here.",1
Marketing: With only five buttons on it.,1
Project Manager: I think I would break it.,1
"Marketing: So, that is why I like cats.",0
Project Manager: So how many functions do you need for the microphone?,0
"Project Manager: No this is bananabando, yeah.",0
User Interface: What what do you want to discuss?,0
"Project Manager: A menu button, maybe.",1
"Project Manager: What if it had something like just like a magnet on the back of it, you could I mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base.",0
User Interface: The alternative is to have a an onscreen display on your television that you control through your remote control.,1
"Industrial Designer: And the base of the remote control, which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel, is interchangeable.",1
User Interface: Let is see.,0
Industrial Designer: So maybe we should consider that.,1
"Industrial Designer: it seemed like a a beep seemed the most reasonable to me,",0
Project Manager: We needed more Play Doh colours.,1
"Marketing: will it minimise the effects of RSI, which was repeated strain injury?",1
"Marketing: Yeah, the favourite charis characteristic is that the long neck, it can reach everything.",1
User Interface: Twelve point five.,0
User Interface: So these are two models of existing remote controls.,1
"Project Manager: So User Interface Designer, that is.",1
User Interface: maybe we should bring Kemy here.,0
"User Interface: The vocabulary is very small, so that is not a problem.",1
Project Manager: And you should explain why you draw that particular animal.,1
User Interface: So we can switch these to.,0
"User Interface: basically, in terms of making decisions, what we'd need to do is first of all decide on a form which of the three different shapes we want, then decide what kind of button layout we want, how many buttons, then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons, if we wanna put any text on the device, like label on the buttons or put a brand name or a logo on it or whatever.",1
"Project Manager: in the sense that they can make it smaller, or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly.",0
"Project Manager: I mean, for example, if you are if you are into the durability issue you could.",0
"Marketing: If you are reading from top to bottom, I think it is better to put it at the top.",0
"Marketing: And we also found out that fifty percent of our people, their the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it.",1
"User Interface: Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons, powerful is that all the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n but here you only have few buttons but you retain the the same powerful functionalities.",1
"Marketing: Cause this is single curve, this is curved on both sides.",0
User Interface: So these are two example.,1
"Industrial Designer: The digital pen was, but SMARTboard was really bad.",1
User Interface: but if you touch the options then it is.,0
"Marketing: So if you have to say up, up, up, up, if you have to do that all the time, then people might get a bit fed up with that, they may return it.",1
User Interface: You can see they can switch form one modality to another.,0
User Interface: This is it is an interesting ideand I think i it looks pretty cool.,1
Marketing: so hopefully our remote control reflects that s in some way.,0
"Industrial Designer: So, I also, since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product, thought we better look at things that are popular, ex go beyond those, as I said in the first meeting, then we might wanna talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in in the construction, especially in the the outside of the product.",1
"Marketing: No, it works if you have not got a special button for it, if you push a one, then on your television there will appear a one, a line, which is an empty space.",1
"Industrial Designer: I do not think it would matter that the buttons were bigger through the, the top casing.",1
"Industrial Designer: So basically when you press a button, a switch get closed.",1
"Industrial Designer: Even it is for s just some kids, you know, switching channels one two three four.",1
"Project Manager: it needs to be sturdy, easy to find, so we gonna have that locator function.",1
"Industrial Designer: Just normal discussion, I think.",0
Marketing: It is gonna vary around the world.,0
Marketing: And let us see what the market demands.,1
"Project Manager: I'm Nick Debusk, I'm the Project Manager.",1
"Project Manager: It i if it is gonna be somewhere that you put it down then it needs to be at the side of your armchair,",1
User Interface: This is the one that I made.,1
Marketing: does not it? To make it beep.,1
User Interface: But not black I think.,0
Project Manager: So this meeting agenda will be the detailed design meeting.,1
"Marketing: And third, I stick with it, the login functionality with the slogan, take parental control to a new dimension.",1
Marketing: The mute button.,1
Industrial Designer: So just yeah I wanted to be sure.,0
Marketing: We are making the most beautiful attractive whatever we decide it is.,0
"Marketing: And if it is made of like latex, that whole idea, that is pretty cool.",1
"Industrial Designer: we can have another, like s simple speech recogniser on our DSB chip.",1
"Marketing: You know, I d I have several four remotes, they all look the same until you get up close, you have to.",0
"Industrial Designer: Kinetic energy it needs I do not have too much technical information on that,",0
"Marketing: Think I can, what this just an example.",1
"Project Manager: As you can see, w opening, acquaintance, tool training, project plan discussion, closing.",1
User Interface: So we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle.,0
"Industrial Designer: it is the scroll wheel, I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel, pushbutton thing.",0
"Marketing: right, if w if we are minimising buttons, we might be able to make them actually larger.",1
Marketing: Could you plug me in?,0
"Marketing: That is not how you spell method, is it?",0
"Industrial Designer: But, would have been maybe for future projects.",0
"User Interface: for yeah shif shifting up in on t on t teletext, shifting down.",0
Industrial Designer: So so I think we can start with these two main things.,0
"User Interface: But it should not be under the flip either, because you can have the remote control closed, but you still might want to activate it by voice.",1
"User Interface: And maybe the shape of the buttons,",1
"Marketing: I think it is the most easier thing,",0
Project Manager: I mean I'd give that nearly a one.,1
"Project Manager: Exce except for the for the special shape, the surfing board, it has a quite a conventional layout of buttons.",1
"Project Manager: Nah, I think we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext.",1
"Project Manager: Well it says only for television here, huh.",0
"Project Manager: Nobody uses teletext very much anymore, so we do not really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control.",0
"Marketing: combine style with a level of functionality, beauty, practicality, a thing of beauty, p function.",0
"Project Manager: But now, in original design I say two.",1
Project Manager: I think we worked great as a team.,0
User Interface: But how it is gonna work will f be a problem.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, that you can flip over, yeah, yeah.",0
"Project Manager: Though I'd have to say depending on how flexible it is, we might need to have some kind of inner frame.",1
"Project Manager: Maybe in a circle for example, like we like in this example.",1
Marketing: Only the LCD.,0
"Marketing: Young people, probably because it is a buzz word, find it very relevant.",1
Project Manager: the profit we must make with the new remote is fifty million Euro.,0
Project Manager: And we still have money left.,0
"User Interface: which makes it easier to find, each can it can respond for your voice, like it can turn on the light for you just to f find it easily, yeah?",0
"Marketing: Nothing, I did not even get an email,",0
"User Interface: The whole thing lights up if you press any button, rather than it just that one button will light up.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yes, but it uses two separate buttons.",0
Project Manager: Exactly the special colours.,1
"Marketing: Bec Twelve, a half.",0
"User Interface: Yeah, my name is Francina.",1
Marketing: So it looks like we are gonna get rid of the whole loca locator thing.,0
Marketing: so I'd probably give it a three.,0
"Project Manager: I think yeah, yeah, r universal remote.",0
"Project Manager: You two you two are gonna be just, I think, you just double up, you know, you working together.",1
"Industrial Designer: If it could be done, should be done.",1
"Marketing: Ah, you did get that in then,",0
"Industrial Designer: indeed, it is not very userfriendly.",0
"Marketing: Easy to use interface, buttons menu, menus.",1
User Interface: So maybe the multifunction can be implemented in in our design.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, but you need another sensor for that, right?",0
"Industrial Designer: And it is very cheap to incorporate an integrated circuit, a chip.",0
"User Interface: Big buttons are convenient, voice recognition helps, push buttons, scroll buttons, spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools.",1
Marketing: One point eight is not it or something.,0
"Project Manager: so we need to wrap it up now, so that we can go away, get on with some of this.",1
Industrial Designer: the locator also goes away.,0
Industrial Designer: And it is very easy to find your remote control.,0
"Industrial Designer: and then they would squeeze it, it would take the shape of their hand.",1
"Marketing: Actually that just raises a point, I wonder what our design people think, but you know on a mobile phone, you can press a key, it gives you a menu, it is got a menu display,",1
Marketing: Very easy to use.,1
Industrial Designer: and the main problems with the well you could go for wood but I think it would be a bit impractical.,0
"User Interface: And it has to be acce accessible with your other hand too, of course.",1
"Marketing: if instead of a constant light up on the, on the remote control, if it lights up for ten seconds when it is touched again.",1
"Marketing: And another thing, how would you like to have a speech recognition on it.",1
"Marketing: so that it has also t plastic I have seen can get really textured, so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand.",1
Project Manager: but remember the main the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost.,0
Industrial Designer: I I'm not sure if it is the same thing.,1
Marketing: so we have to go through each point.,1
Marketing: s advanced chip.,0
Industrial Designer: But you can in like incorporate that with a scroll button as well.,0
Industrial Designer: or else they would have been ano another shape.,0
"Project Manager: First the functional design which will be first we will do individual work, come into a meeting, the conceptional design, individual work, a meeting, then the detailed design, individual work, a meeting.",1
"Marketing: So that was what I meant there, as I said on the slide there consulting the Industrial Engineer about that, the other thing is timing is really gonna be as important as money, because if we are gonna sell this thing, I think the best time to sell it is as a Christmas present.",1
Marketing: But I think we can all make the fronts of titanium or something really thin.,0
Industrial Designer: Yeah but it can be on the display in a corner all the time on the remote.,0
Industrial Designer: You can have f four kind of pushbuttons.,1
User Interface: No I have Well I showed it somewhere.,0
"Marketing: so this is only for to get in the menu, or to exit it.",0
Marketing: that is within the budget.,1
"User Interface: Yeah, I think we should just imagine white buttons.",1
Industrial Designer: But I prefer like a potentialmeter or something like.,1
"User Interface: so it should be maybe this button is power on, off? Or no? I can see nothing.",0
Project Manager: So we use a normal battery.,1
"Industrial Designer: I, I think we should just like take advantage of like using this to its full potential.",0
Industrial Designer: There are different cases that can be provided.,1
User Interface: Sh I think there was plenty of room.,0
Marketing: but maybe for a Spanish for I for.,0
"Industrial Designer: S bad design, that thing.",0
"Marketing: I I say two, personally.",1
Industrial Designer: In the shared map.,0
"Marketing: Yeah, for sure.",0
Industrial Designer: It I th it is fine.,0
"Marketing: we could call like a fruit name,",1
"Project Manager: we indicate the amount of components of the specif specific component, how much we need of them.",1
Marketing: Or you get the menu on the LCD screen on the remote control.,1
Industrial Designer: We had we had too little information actually.,1
User Interface: They like that spongy feel.,1
User Interface: And going to a regular bat Yeah.,0
Industrial Designer: The speech recognition is out.,1
"User Interface: And Yeah, well arrow b buttons can be blue.",1
"Marketing: Yeah, I mean it is.",0
User Interface: there is a I mean you know there is are some with a wheel like this.,1
Marketing: well most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy lookandfeel.,1
Project Manager: Then we will evaluate the product.,0
Project Manager: So that is leads us to our little discussion.,0
"Marketing: Personally, like I might reverse it, but if we are working for this company then I guess no matter what, we have to stress fashion the most.",1
"User Interface: then we have the scroll button with integrated pushbutton, kind of like a modern a bit bulky, a bit crazy,",1
Marketing: I'm just curious to see this.,0
"User Interface: but as the Marketing Manager says, people is willing to people are willing to pay more for good design.",1
"Project Manager: and offer a product which is not as expensive, not as complicated.",0
User Interface: They would not be necessary to the actual shape of the thing.,0
"Project Manager: good call, I missed that.",0
Marketing: You have to go really slow when you are writing.,0
Project Manager: Y or you could have it so you on the wheel if you.,1
Project Manager: A little box you can attach to your TV is fine then.,0
Project Manager: That should still be viable.,0
User Interface: And people can still decide to use the cheaper one.,0
"Project Manager: And the technical aspects And also labelling of the buttons, the functions should be universal standards.",0
"Marketing: Well yeah, so I'd give it a two.",0
"Project Manager: And yeah, we could take out the curve.",1
"Project Manager: I think, if I'm not wrong, we are making the remote control.",1
Industrial Designer: what is the next phase f Flores?,1
Industrial Designer: we have made a prototype.,0
Industrial Designer: It looks like that beast from Sesame Street.,0
"Project Manager: Well, we were above, so we did a little redesign.",1
Project Manager: Maybe we can include that also.,1
"User Interface: I'm Kendra, I'm the Us User Interface Designer, I have not had a whole lot of experience in this kind of thing before but I'm m so I will be working on the design.",0
"User Interface: there is the LCD screen, which maybe is too expensive, but I think also at the scroll wheel, I have not mentioned it here, the scroll wheel could be used without an LCD screen, just for changing channel nbers easily.",1
"Industrial Designer: So if we are going for fashion in our cases, I think that what we are gonna wanna look at is a curved or a doublecurved case, probably with a variety of design elements.",1
User Interface: Do you think it says RR?,0
"User Interface: We came to a very predic creative design, yeah.",1
"Marketing: I think b because we do not have a lot of buttons on the one screen,",0
"User Interface: Cause we make them in different colours,",1
"Industrial Designer: And this is the last point, the choice of chips.",1
"Industrial Designer: but I was thinking more of the buttons, because the buttons which they have said that they have put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture, it is meant to be anti RSI.",0
Project Manager: Or some bump.,0
Industrial Designer: You can make a trigger button or something like that.,1
"Project Manager: usually not a car, all of those things.",0
"Project Manager: new product should reach a market with customers that are younger than forty, now we have current customers of forty plus.",0
"Industrial Designer: Or you can use solar cells, but I'm not sure about that indoors, really, but.",1
Marketing: And when I speak about method I speak about the marketing of the product h.,0
"Project Manager: Project method, functional design, individual work, another meeting, conceptual design, individual work, a meeting of details design, individual work, a meeting.",0
"Project Manager: Or I like, you know, the black finish or the silver finish or whatever.",0
"User Interface: You look up, I have a Philips H fifty five.",0
Project Manager: And see what we can come up with.,0
Project Manager: First it will be the functional design.,1
"Industrial Designer: That is a bit too much, but.",0
"Marketing: The three important things of refa are from th of this year is are,",0
"Project Manager: So it you wanna group all the different kind of types of functions together, you know.",1
User Interface: So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface.,1
Project Manager: So this the key point.,0
"Marketing: our secondary audience, people above forty a forty years in age, they like the dark traditional colours.",1
"Project Manager: I do not know if you a al also received it, but there were four points which I think are very important.",0
User Interface: We got the logo off the web browser.,0
Industrial Designer: Chip on print with a with a simple a sim not a simple but a.,1
"Project Manager: I want to say I'm the secretary, so I make the minutes.",1
"Marketing: So you can have a remote control full of buttons, a hundreds of buttons, but if you do not use them, yeah it is.",1
"Project Manager: So we have now a lunch break, finally,",1
Marketing: I do not know.,0
"Marketing: And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven, one being true, so it is more like it is fits the criteria, seven being as in it does not fit the criteria.",1
Project Manager: and well we had some some presentations from you three.,0
Project Manager: If somebody has some questions they can ask them now.,1
"Project Manager: User Interface Designer, Roo, I would like to see the user interface c concept.",1
Marketing: so like a pet animal.,0
Marketing: I did not say it in my presentation.,0
"Marketing: I think we were we were very good, yeah.",0
"Project Manager: today we once again have three presentations, if I'm right, after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts.",1
"Industrial Designer: Rubber casing I thing would probably the best, if we are going for the antiRSI, like more choice with aesthetics.",1
"Marketing: Alright, well, point out the advanced chip for now, I guess.",1
Project Manager: And we are going to use default materials.,1
Marketing: Yeah so it should fit right in into your hand.,1
Industrial Designer: Y you could add an extra feature actually.,1
"Project Manager: I think it would be good to have a contrast between, if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up, see something quite fancy looking inside.",1
Industrial Designer: that should be it.,0
"Industrial Designer: There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time,",1
"Marketing: I'd say two or three for that one, personally.",1
"Project Manager: I will introduce myself, I think it is very good to introduce yourself.",0
"Project Manager: So that might be an idea of using the rubber,",1
User Interface: Did you receive the email about the voice recognition?,0
"Industrial Designer: Also when it comes to the ergonomics of the whole thing, if you wanna make it square for the looks of it, then maybe to make it more comfortable to hold the whole thing, you add a little bulge down here.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, probably yeah, probably it is a yeah, yeah.",0
"Marketing: So we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these,",0
"Industrial Designer: leftright balance, maybe even preprogrammed sound modes, like the user could determine like a series of sound modes,",0
"Marketing: I ca not cut, paste it into the other folder but.",0
Project Manager: ach that is a shame.,0
"Industrial Designer: so it kinda your hand still holds it, have it there,",0
"User Interface: No a scroll Well, like four buttons, up, down, left, right with enter in the middle, that will correspond to a menu on the screen.",1
Marketing: and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here.,1
"Marketing: I was also supposed to calculate the score, but thought we would have another private thingy after this.",1
Project Manager: To go to the next one?,0
Industrial Designer: Really have It needs to be able y have to be able to find it.,0
User Interface: The 'Cause they can use that better.,0
Marketing: We have two buttons missing.,1
"Industrial Designer: every now, then you need to replace the batteries.",0
"Project Manager: Eight point two, right? So, we looks like we are well within budget.",1
"Marketing: And maybe we should use this also as an button, still.",0
"Marketing: and maybe power follows something like a channel up channel down power, then that would make that choice.",0
User Interface: I'm just wondering whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones.,0
"Project Manager: we want to be modern, fun, different.",0
Project Manager: So next meeting will be in in thirty minutes.,0
Project Manager: Say Or you can take the single chip.,1
"Project Manager: Ah I was trying to draw a dolphin,",1
"Project Manager: I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it will affect how long it takes us to get it into production, the time to market.",1
"Industrial Designer: And LCDs, we can have LCDs.",1
Marketing: what do you think about a backandforth comeup button?,0
Project Manager: Was that you?,0
Project Manager: So it should this question should be hard to lose.,1
"Industrial Designer: Or you could well you could s actually look at the placeholder you talked about earlier,",1
User Interface: But then loo but then I found if you look at you see on the left one there are too many buttons.,0
"Marketing: it is red, but Look, feel is everybo it is true.",0
Project Manager: The reason I ga I did not give it a one I think I gave it a three because I thought you'd have to like unc clip.,0
"Marketing: And fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons,",1
Project Manager: But I'd like to hear your thoughts.,1
"Marketing: The met methodology to find out the trend was incl was done in a way We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey, but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market, because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales, profit.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, we are ahead of the game there.",0
"Industrial Designer: buttons are in the frape shape of fruits or something, apple, banana, something like that.",0
User Interface: And that is a very bad concept.,0
Project Manager: And how many buttons do we have?,1
"Project Manager: It has to be original, trendy, userfriendly.",1
"Industrial Designer: And the fourth option is the solar cells, which are also made by the company.",1
"Industrial Designer: and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it, for example.",1
User Interface: So we can put all the.,0
"Project Manager: I think maybe we should do it on a b button itself though, because if people are able to change the covers,",1
"Industrial Designer: Might be hard to find, though.",1
Industrial Designer: Just say LCD.,1
User Interface: And the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down.,1
Industrial Designer: Like a web browser back button.,1
Project Manager: text TV still has to be a possibility.,0
"Industrial Designer: The TV switches to the frequency, or what function it is.",1
Industrial Designer: Something like that.,1
"Marketing: Then you can work together too by mail or by, I dunno, chat, something,",1
Industrial Designer: I thought it was the other way round too.,1
"Industrial Designer: Li like a web browser,",1
Marketing: So it So now we.,0
Project Manager: You want the normal piece of paper? And you have a pen?,0
"User Interface: Then you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like change the lights, I dunno, close the windows, whatever, turn the heating on, I think that is something we may need to have as at least as an optional extra to kinda make our product cool, since we say we are putting the fashion in electronics.",1
"Industrial Designer: Well so the price to produce For the simplest one, say we start from four dollars to produce such a device.",1
Project Manager: we will I will first present what we are going to do in this meeting.,1
Marketing: And even then we did get a decent product turned out although it is not everything we wanted it to be.,0
Project Manager: I think you pay half per remote.,1
"User Interface: And I think as you can see so, the LCD screen does look better at the lower end, or at the bottom.",1
"Marketing: The remote control has big, clear channel switching buttons.",1
Project Manager: But as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing.,1
"User Interface: Yeah b no, you can push this one, but we do not have a pushbutton we ca we do not have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing.",1
Project Manager: We really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it.,1
"Project Manager: but you will you do need also an, also you would need a battery in the base unit as well, you know.",0
User Interface: I like usercentr centred also the best.,0
"Project Manager: it is the kinetic battery that is kind of expensive, but we have a simple chip, single curve,",1
Marketing: S so you activate the menu.,0
"Marketing: Using the remote control, ninety eight percent of the time for changing channels, that is for flickering through channels.",0
"Industrial Designer: But obviously that is not our problem since we have decided or against solar cells, I asse right? Or is anybody still.",0
"Industrial Designer: And I think, what I said, everybody has them has them already.",1
"Marketing: I think on a remote control for television you do not need to be able to programme the VCR to start recording at three PM or whatever,",0
Marketing: Yeah I mean a screen on top looks more lo logical to me.,1
Industrial Designer: And I think we must look further to to devel d develop something news.,1
Marketing: It is not coming.,0
"User Interface: Nothing more than this, just a remote control.",1
User Interface: That is not up to you.,0
Project Manager: to ma because we spent entire stage designing a product of which we had no idea what it would cost.,0
Industrial Designer: And then you can buy the covers.,1
"Project Manager: I mean, why not have a little rounded kind of thing,",1
"Marketing: So, I investigated the remote control market in greater detail, my the theme of what I was to work on was trend watch.",1
"Marketing: Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them,",1
"Industrial Designer: circuit board, chip we can have a simple one, a regular one or an advanced one, depending on what our other needs are.",1
"Industrial Designer: but it is rather about an instinctual thing,",0
"Marketing: Yeah, I mean the volume buttons could be lemons or something, maybe.",1
"Project Manager: So, now, last time.",0
"User Interface: Well we have we have the sample speaker as well, which is yeah, it is kind of new.",1
"Project Manager: And one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour, slogan are recognisable, which is apparently black, yellow, but I'm not sure if we I think we should keep the logo in mind, because with colours you can have a lot of fashionable colours, everything on it, which suits everybody is taste.",0
Marketing: And eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy.,1
"Project Manager: But y you can have of course different between DVDs, televisions, between.",0
Marketing: And then you could still have that available.,0
"Marketing: good, well designed buttons, intuitive buttons.",1
"Marketing: but we are leaning quite a bit to the side of being lowtech, rubber buttons plastic frame, it is almost like we are reproducing the same old remote control that is out there.",1
"Marketing: They also want a remote control to be technologically innovative, of course, as we predicted, that it should be easy to use.",1
"Project Manager: And that is number two, right?",0
User Interface: And the personal preference would be a spe to incorporate speech recognisers which will respond to user is voice for a particular function.,0
"Industrial Designer: If we use a scroll, then we have the regular chip.",1
"Marketing: Yeah, only for television On the market you can now buy for twenty Euros a remote control for everything.",1
"User Interface: well I think first off, basically I do agree with what Sarah has defined as your personal preferences,yeah.",1
"Marketing: And f the fancy, that is exactly the term, I'm thinking polished, elegant, you know, kind of innovative, but a cut above.",1
Industrial Designer: so that is the three kind of interfaces that we have.,0
Project Manager: I think it takes up a lot of a lot of power.,1
"Marketing: but I mean they do need to be able to identify it, RSI, I'm not very sure what that is.",1
"Project Manager: you should explain with different colours, with different pen widths.",1
"User Interface: So there is a pretty wide range of remote controls these days, this remote control on the right here is one of the more extravagant, but it is not really it is by no means you know on it is own in being so expensive.",0
"Industrial Designer: is not there a possibility to do research on that, so we know that for sure? If you rule out functions, then that gets known, then people are not gonna buy it.",1
"User Interface: So make it just a different colour or different shape,",1
"Industrial Designer: If we decide to use the speech recognition, then we probably could struggle but we will see afterwards.",1
"User Interface: As for the as for the single curve, well this edge, this edge, like I say it would be nice to have some curvature to it, but it is not absolutely necessary.",1
"User Interface: Well, the other option is in instead of a scroll you just have the buttons up on the side which are on the side.",1
Project Manager: Yeah we can change the b.,0
"Marketing: Yeah, I d I do not know many people without a TV.",0
"Industrial Designer: the case material, I have a been sent what the factory can actually give us, the there is the plastic which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case case housing.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, w we had so much information, that we get through email, just.",0
"Industrial Designer: I got an email And it says the chip can be simple, regular or advanced.",1
"User Interface: cause we have thrown a lot of features onto the table, but do we actually want to incorporate all of them, or have we missed anything?",1
Project Manager: And then we get to the point of the case.,1
"Marketing: the power button is used very much, channel selection, volume, teletext.",0
"Project Manager: I think we will get around to that, yeah.",0
"Project Manager: In the menus of the LCD or in the back of the remote control, or something like that.",0
"Project Manager: Right so, apologies for the last meeting, it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough, so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting.",1
"User Interface: And you can navigate easier, because wi with the you have to push the arrows, with a normal TV remote.",0
"Marketing: What do I think? because a fancy look is the most important thing for remote control control, I think about changeable fronts.",1
Industrial Designer: it will bring the cost down.,0
"Marketing: Yeah, but if like you are on the phone in the other room, you need turn television off or something, you do not really want to go into the put the telephone down, go into the other room.",0
Project Manager: And you are gonna do some product evaluation.,0
Project Manager: And then we going to do some finance to see if it is feasible.,0
Marketing: I th think it is not the most spongy thing.,0
Marketing: I just did not know if you guys had any in mind yet.,0
"Project Manager: What if we had what if we had not only say we went with the ball the ball function, but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s to make it easier to hold on to.",0
Marketing: And how important the users find them.,0
"Marketing: I do not know where exactly,",0
"User Interface: In that case you want to browse faster, browse slow, you want to have those kind of functionalities.",1
Industrial Designer: Yeah the logo.,0
"Marketing: But Th they are referring to the fruit, veg thing.",0
"Project Manager: We were kinda going, yeah, it is gotta feel nice, it is gotta look cool, that it is.",0
"Industrial Designer: It will just shout out I'm here, or something to similar effect.",0
User Interface: I think that'd probably scare me.,1
"Industrial Designer: You give it the full functions in here, just a couple of functions in there.",1
Industrial Designer: So still we want to keep LCD? Or.,0
Industrial Designer: Or maybe four.,0
"Marketing: You know what a Mac iPod is? I'm thinking however Mac iPod is sort of last year is because it is very hard, sort of glassy, glossy, so I'm thinking if we imagine that we are taking some of the features of a Mac iPod, we are then making it s more of like a more of like a comfortable type of or more of like a maybe more vibrant to friendly thing to have.",0
"User Interface: And then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for, oops, channels, volume, sort of for surfing channels, then volume, so the volume would be the up, down, 'cause volume goes up, down, then channels left to right.",1
"Project Manager: So, I just put d quickly Remo, but if you have any o other names that we co could decide for just to keep something fun for our project we should we could discuss quickly.",1
Project Manager: As to what they want.,1
"User Interface: And everything is blue, except the power button.",1
Industrial Designer: And then it d then it has some more energy.,0
Project Manager: I do not think so.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, but how many units did we need to sell?",0
"Industrial Designer: yeah, that is a good that is a good point, so.",0
Project Manager: you can you open the conceptual design presentation?,0
"Marketing: well, he said about n abo what he said about pointing.",0
"Marketing: Autumn colours like red, brown.",1
User Interface: I think it is going to be y.,0
"User Interface: where it is, obviously it would not be that floppy 'cause this would be hard plastic.",0
Industrial Designer: And might be easier huh?,0
Marketing: If you if you give me if you give me a cutout of what everybody else has then I need to I need to find a lower cost.,1
"User Interface: For the body design I think plastic, w yeah.",1
Project Manager: I say lose the curve.,1
"Project Manager: first of all I will start with the costs,",0
"Project Manager: Well this is a requirement that we have to stick to I'm afraid,",1
"Industrial Designer: yeah, I thought I will use the whiteboard instead.",0
User Interface: Some things that sort of relevant to what I wanna say.,1
"User Interface: Yeah, w we have done a lot of detail in light, so.",0
Marketing: Yeah you can open it with the picture preview or stuff like that.,0
"User Interface: Like the remote control which we use for TV, it shou it should be used f for some other purpose also, like controlling the temperature inside the house or for airconditioners, or for heating system.",1
"Project Manager: So so it is still stuck with thirteen, so I had to take out the special colour I suppose.",1
"Project Manager: I think you have to indicate the amount of pushbuttons we want to use, is not it?",1
Project Manager: No buttons at all.,1
User Interface: My own view is that we should definitely be going for a user focused design.,1
"Project Manager: Whilst at the same time you want, as you rightly said, one remote for all.",1
"Industrial Designer: so like big b buttons, for people you are visually impaired.",1
Industrial Designer: so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them.,1
Industrial Designer: For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities.,1
"Industrial Designer: Like if the kinetic thing, I think what is best about that is that it is instant energy.",1
"Project Manager: and then we can work for thirty minutes, I have to write very fast to make the minich min minutes.",1
Industrial Designer: So it has to be a modern design.,0
"Marketing: And from this we basically came up with the figure that the channel buttons, the channel selection buttons are the most by far the most used buttons on the remote control.",1
Industrial Designer: That is something we can also discuss.,0
"User Interface: And the battery, is it kind of a rechargeable or it does not matter?",1
Project Manager: So you can see it on our site.,1
Marketing: Or with exterior designs.,1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, I do not I do not know how for twenty fi, or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get,",1
"Industrial Designer: Having to tick it before you go off was a bit hindering as well, 'cause you are half way through a thought, then you run out of paper, then you have to jump.",1
"User Interface: This one this is the user centred, it has quite a few fewer buttons.",0
"Industrial Designer: the case oops, that is the on off button just come off our prototype.",0
"User Interface: which is one of the things I really wanted to keep, is keep it simple, not have too many buttons, not have too many functionalities thrown into it.",1
"Marketing: I mean I did not receive any information on that, but I think the competition, sussing out what other people are doing, what is in the pipeline is very important, because there is a question about do you want an LCD screen, that was not responded to, but some of the larger remotes do have screens where you can navigate, you know, so it turns into something perhaps you all have seen the Osbournes where Ozzy Osbourne is attempting to manage his super entertainment system with something that looks like a a small tray.",1
"Marketing: No, that is good.",0
Project Manager: Did they not have they did not like mine.,0
User Interface: it is easier to to do the th things that are like that on a computer.,0
User Interface: We we have to wait until we get to a more specific design phase for that.,0
Marketing: Would spend more money if it looks fancy.,0
"Marketing: Becau But the picture would be a lot different if we did not have to drop those those things, I guess.",0
Industrial Designer: It is got it.,0
Project Manager: We can put then.,0
"Marketing: They are more back into soft feel, spongy feeling things, things with maybe a little cloth on them.",1
Industrial Designer: and then have the standard rubber buttons as well.,1
Industrial Designer: If we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip.,1
"Marketing: You have to have a certain element of flatness, I think.",1
Industrial Designer: I thought you guys hated it.,0
Marketing: If people like talk like.,0
Industrial Designer: Functionally you are gonna have to intercept So four is a good estimate for.,0
"Industrial Designer: O, as for the colours, we were presented with a limited range of colours for this prototype.",1
Project Manager: we make two concepts.,1
Industrial Designer: So this is the circuit board.,0
Project Manager: This is how today seems to be going to work.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah nee No, if i the remote can send like the code for seven hundred, page seven hundred to the television.",1
"Project Manager: Jurgen, you want to go next?",0
"Industrial Designer: material, you use plastic.",1
"Industrial Designer: And moreover it has LCD, everything,",0
"Project Manager: And you you, well, think about requirements,",1
"Marketing: that adding this whole like PDA pen business is only one more thing to lose,",1
Project Manager: So each remote with a special colour.,1
User Interface: So it is easy in your hand indeed.,0
Industrial Designer: Are we take too much time?,0
User Interface: Perhaps that you have a lot of road remotes r road con remote controls.,0
Marketing: Unless things have suddenly change again.,0
"Project Manager: it is like, you know, like s you said earlier on ab a flip thing, something like that,",1
Project Manager: I think so.,1
Project Manager: There is a functional design.,1
"Project Manager: This we are talking about one unit, so when it go into the quantity, the cost will come down.",1
"Project Manager: right now so we are all gonna draw our favourite animal, then sum up our favourite characteristics of that animal.",0
"Marketing: Well, I think it is I think it is pretty trendy, to be honest, but I do not know if well, I'm coming back to the costs again, but I think we gotta build a b pretty cheap design to stay within our limits.",1
"User Interface: Yeah we will come up to that, the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more.",1
"Marketing: That is my Yeah, like the older o older colours I can maybe.",0
"User Interface: I was thinking titanium, I was thinking it is just I have been influenced by pictures of iPods, they are also minimalist, shiny.",1
User Interface: It is a unique item.,0
"Marketing: But if it is trendy, if it is fancy, it is got some colour to it, if it is very easy easy to use, if it is got simple remote speech remote control, like I said, louder, softer, change channel, on, off, remote, it goes beep, I can find my remote without spending half a day looking for it, getting all upset 'cause I ca not turn the TV on.",1
"Project Manager: Well, because they have teletext on it.",0
"Marketing: Well, that is when you go to uni, is not it? So, you know.",1
"Project Manager: the agenda will be the opening, that is the product manager or secretary that is me, the presentations from the Christine, Agnes, from Mister Ed.",0
"Project Manager: well we can use we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially,",1
Marketing: my remote control tends to fall a lot.,1
"Marketing: Can you like I mean this may be too complicated, but, I wish I had something to explain it, like if it was just a simple, either this way or this way, that had like the main buttons, then you could like pull something out, kind of, like you got the rest the buttons,",1
User Interface: It should not be diffi.,0
Marketing: Could not we have like one that comes out? Like so you have one in like.,0
Marketing: I think we do.,1
"Industrial Designer: So not how much n not how often it is used, but.",0
"Marketing: my personal preference is that we make some adjustment in the cost, either lower or develop an integrated new technol technology.",1
Marketing: Now in my opinion we need to give them a package back.,0
"Industrial Designer: If you have older people or people like me that are not very coordinated handeye, it is really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons, if we can help it.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, maybe so.",0
"User Interface: I mean if somebody go goes into the store they are gonna see like three or four normal remotes, then a big spongy pink t tomato remote.",0
"Marketing: Yeah, but I mean if you have an addons, the kids may just hide the parental module.",0
"Project Manager: maybe we sh should we t I do not know if we should talk about, how much time have we got left?",0
Industrial Designer: one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum.,1
"Industrial Designer: if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five, it is a scroll wheel so we we have put it is pushbutton, scroll wheel, LCD display,",1
"Project Manager: because she is doing the design, but you are the core because you are in the marketing,",1
"Project Manager: but no more buttons or functions, or?",0
"Project Manager: the way that we are going to go about this is, we will have a time where we can, come up with new ideas alone, work on the project, then, after we have brainstormed, thought about, we can come together in a meeting, discuss what, what, what kind of functional design we want to use.",1
Marketing: It is a kind of remote control.,0
Marketing: That would be a nice nice device I guess.,0
"Project Manager: So, the advanced is for the LCD, the regular for the joystick.",0
User Interface: He will do it in his free time.,0
"Marketing: So we still have that noise thing, yeah?",0
User Interface: Of or you should put it in the LCD screen.,1
Project Manager: So just to recap on.,0
Project Manager: And we should target the inter an international market.,1
"Project Manager: the first stage, the functional design we are going to search for the user requirements, we will make a specific specification of that.",0
"Project Manager: I think w when the selling price is twenty five, you got two million, two million remotes.",1
"Industrial Designer: I think it could either be you could go either one extreme, be very colourful, or you could make it clear, kind of blend in with things, so you did not have to have a problem with the th the decoration of the of the user is home.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, let me interrupt you if you can add other facility, other feature, like unbreakable.",1
"Marketing: If we if w if we were going to have a product that worked for DVDs, VCRs, everything, then I can see the market niche,",1
User Interface: So we do not have any we do not have.,0
"User Interface: really easy to use buttons, not very small buttons, but not the also the big buttons, but just normal buttons.",0
"Marketing: That was, yeah, one of the most important things that Trendwatch said.",0
"Marketing: And finally, last but not least, easy to locate.",1
"Marketing: Basically becoming a choice between like either a good remote, a higher production cost, or just any other remote control.",0
"User Interface: material, I think Kate is gonna tackle that quite a bit, but I think we have two different options, because we did make a another one, which wa is in the shape of banana, it is just if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons, like just like this but in the shape of a banana,",1
Project Manager: Would you pay for speech recognition in a remote control.?,0
"User Interface: I think our market niche is basically people who need who have lost their remote or who have broken their remote, do not wanna send back to the manufacturer, they just wanna run out to the store, get a remote, then they are gonna look on the shelf, they are gonna see ours is the nicest looking remote.",0
"User Interface: So light or just whatever colour, but the same light colours.",1
"Marketing: Just keep it simple, Well the docking station, small screen would be our main points of interest, because this would be the These would be the innovativeness in the remote control.",0
"Industrial Designer: Doublecurved, you ca not do titanium.",0
"Project Manager: As you can see, the use of an LC display advanced chip, what would determine the scroll wheel here as well because it is an integrated scroll wheel push button that was not quite what I think they had in mind with a joystick.",1
Marketing: Now I'm supposed to see how long my leash is here.,0
"Industrial Designer: Well I'm not a big fan of any Microsoft, PowerPoint or any of this stuff.",1
"Industrial Designer: So they also emailed me that they have available a bunch of different buttons, a scroll wheels, integrated push buttons s such as a computer mouse.",1
"Marketing: And the colour should be yellow, or something.",0
"Project Manager: I have made a presentation but I will open it on the Smartboard, so we can all see it.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, it is also not a good it is not you have to really do it only kinetic, you do not want it to think about batteries anymore.",0
Project Manager: But it is no worse than any of the other pl remote controls we have.,0
User Interface: It has to be a small unit.,1
User Interface: No no it is not I think that is n that is not a problem because you do not have to wear a microphone.,0
User Interface: Or it runs the whole.,0
Project Manager: I believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be.,1
"User Interface: So, my name is Mark Dwight, I am responsible for User Interface Design.",1
"Project Manager: Fancy, fashion, powerful, easy to use.",1
Project Manager: I think that is the what they mean by a special colour.,1
Project Manager: Yeah also like this.,0
Marketing: easy to find in a room? .,1
"User Interface: I will give it a five 'cause i it would be easy to lose something like that, yeah.",0
"User Interface: you press on the top, it takes one number, you press on the bottom it takes another number, basically so the space covered so that you do not see two separate keys there actually.",1
Industrial Designer: And it is also cheaper to produce.,0
Marketing: Kick it out.,1
"Project Manager: So, costs are within budget,",1
Industrial Designer: Perhaps we should make m.,0
Industrial Designer: So it has an it is easier.,0
Project Manager: No we ca not.,0
"Project Manager: You could make a few v very colourful ones, a very traditional co cover.",1
"Project Manager: The it is made for s people well, the they do not if it was r useless technology, they would not put it as a possibility.",0
Industrial Designer: And we have speech recognition.,1
"Industrial Designer: how do you enlarge it, so that you can have the.",0
Marketing: And I think we want to sell our product for longer than one year.,1
Project Manager: You know that could be the charger.,1
"Industrial Designer: but with three D curved remote controls, we must use rubber buttons.",1
Industrial Designer: We have the more advanced menu setting right here.,0
Project Manager: it is a it is a beginning.,0
Industrial Designer: I think the batteries would have to go right under the plastic case.,1
User Interface: What is this single curved what does it mean?,0
Project Manager: And the button that you can go to AV for your video.,1
Project Manager: We have to sum up everything.,1
"Marketing: should be about one point s seven,",0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, maybe we should see yours first.",0
Marketing: We better make we better make it like this.,0
"User Interface: This one is engineeringcentred, so this one has the most functions, things.",0
Industrial Designer: And we have sample speaker.,1
"User Interface: Suddenly if viewer he gets a telephone call, if he want he does not want to switch off the TV, but he can reduce the sound, he can bring the volume down, he can watch he can while talking he can watch the TV.",0
"Marketing: Yes, I do think, who is gonna have the money to buy that also, that one?",1
"User Interface: There is key rings that you kind of whistle at or clap at, I ca not remember, then they whistle back, or something like that.",1
Marketing: Remote control mainly be sold to younger people.,1
"Project Manager: Yeah, you should you should drop the speech recognition.",1
"User Interface: Well I'm my function is User Interface Design, I think.",0
Industrial Designer: So there was there was a constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape.,1
Marketing: I would break it.,1
"Project Manager: Yeah but just press save,",0
"User Interface: it would make it hard to turn the machine off, to turn your TV off.",1
Project Manager: Do we hardly I think it should be at the bottom somewhere.,1
User Interface: and then have sort of a nice bold colour for the buttons.,1
Marketing: The remote control is not ugly.,1
User Interface: MP three player.,1
"Project Manager: Everything else we can really, we can really.",0
"Project Manager: Just keep you just make new covers for the for it,",0
"Marketing: At first, the colours of fruit.",1
Marketing: remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room.,1
"Marketing: I think for most of those ratings that it is high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that, I really doubt if on the basis of current technology, our current capabilities, we could actually do much more to minimise that.",1
"Marketing: Maybe I mean if I get m more numbers, I will email you before the next meeting in terms of ages.",1
"Project Manager: we agreed that the colour should be b yellow, black.",0
Marketing: But nee the function of it.,0
"User Interface: I think it was great,",1
"User Interface: But, I think the logo would definitely be recognisable.",1
"Project Manager: Good morning, Ruud.",0
Project Manager: I do not think so.,0
User Interface: The logo at the bottom.,1
User Interface: I'm thinking we could if we are hav So ba I mean but an iPod just has that circle thing you know.,0
Industrial Designer: Yeah but how many yeah.,0
Project Manager: which make it like new also.,0
Industrial Designer: grey or black or something like that.,1
Industrial Designer: And also how much I think.,0
Project Manager: But I'm now did y did you work with the same prices that I have here?,0
"Project Manager: or I see, that is.",0
Project Manager: You then discuss it.,1
"Project Manager: with the type, the supplements.",0
"Project Manager: And, is it gonna be a remote control that is what it can be used for different kind of equipment, like your TV, your home stereo?",0
Industrial Designer: and the TV will translate it into a function.,1
"Marketing: everything else, I think, you know, you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control, 'cause they are just not needed, they are not used.",1
"Marketing: S since it knows who is using it, it might also record the kind of channels you are u more often using, levels of volumes that you are more often things like that.",0
Project Manager: So maybe this we should look into this younger demographic.,1
Marketing: We need it to be seen.,0
User Interface: Well d we will just call it fancy then.,0
Marketing: That is gonna hurt us.,0
"Marketing: Yeah, I think I agree with the single design thing for now, because we are trying to do so much, that if we are trying to make a unique, userfriendly, dadada, it is also multi also multifunctional, we are gonna go over budget for one thing.",1
Project Manager: So that is it for toda for We are going to have a lunch break.,0
"User Interface: I think even that,",0
Marketing: That is almost fifty minutes.,0
Marketing: Our final prototype which yeah.,0
"Marketing: Right, so it is kind of doing away with the programming feature?",0
"User Interface: Basically in what we discussed, cover, buttons will be made of rubber, yellow colour, black components, as you can see right over here.",1
Marketing: and so you can I have.,0
"Marketing: And maybe as far as design goes, maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences,",1
"Marketing: I mean s three quarters of the next age group, twenty five to thirty five are interested, with the technologies improving, if we can get these.",1
Industrial Designer: the component design.,1
"User Interface: because if you want say we can sort by channels or sort by TV programs, you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them.",1
Project Manager: case material supplements.,1
"Project Manager: We can I can bring the excel up sheet up, show you if you wish.",0
"Project Manager: So, we have got these four criteria here for satisfaction.",0
"Project Manager: Yeah but when you use two, you can use it two times longer.",1
Project Manager: Well we have got that it is remote for TV only otherwise project would become too complex with which would endanger the time to market was one of the considerations.,0
Project Manager: We have to give answers so.,0
"User Interface: because depending on what users want, depends on how you sell it, what tag lines you attach to it, how you try to make it more attractive to users.",1
Marketing: I'm gonna talk about functional requirements.,0
"User Interface: So you must, for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics.",1
Project Manager: where is the voice recognition?,0
Project Manager: Which will probably just usurp what I said so.,0
"Project Manager: come up ki you know, be ab for the next meeting be able to come in, show us some i some physical ideas.",1
User Interface: So interme interface concept by your faithful user interface designer.,1
"Project Manager: Because we are only going to have a very few key, you have got you know a small LCD, joystick, e I think it leaves you open to a potential wide range of shapes, something that can make it stand out slightly.",1
"User Interface: But can we delete it, just with delete? Or.",0
"Industrial Designer: So the way to go is if you want a scroll wheel you either make it flat, angular, add an LCD screen, then you can basically choose either plastic or titani.",0
Project Manager: Maybe you can draw your favourite animal.,0
"User Interface: but what if it was kind of a stylised banana? You know, rather than having it kind of you know yellow, really looking exactly like a banana, you could make it kind of silver.",1
Project Manager: Now we have to decide what controls do we need.,1
"Industrial Designer: which include, you know, space craft, coffee makers, bullet trains Or or a high speed train.",0
Project Manager: And what if we lose the LCD?,0
Project Manager: In one or ano another way.,0
Industrial Designer: Wh why would it be a need to have a normal button?,0
Project Manager: So I see you in thirty minutes.,0
"Industrial Designer: If somebody says, where is the remote, then it goes beep beep or something,",1
Industrial Designer: Because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu.,1
"Project Manager: we are gonna discuss the look, feel design, the user interface design, we are gonna evaluate the product.",1
"Marketing: Well we had the we had the data saying that old people will be less likely to pay extra money but the funct the increased functionality, the e ease of use of the device might make up for that.",1
"User Interface: And Sarah, you coordinated the work very well.",1
User Interface: So zero to nine or something.,0
Project Manager: So just general thumbs up for all of us then.,1
Project Manager: Wo would that be agreeable?,0
Industrial Designer: There is a dynamo.,0
Project Manager: what you have to do.,1
"Project Manager: But so does everybody has experiences with remote controls, I mean not the ordinary mote controls, but also a little bit different ones? Like you can use for other?",0
"Marketing: True, i probabl I think we are banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people, like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too,",1
"Project Manager: Well I like the feel of it, I like the feel of it.",1
Project Manager: The new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty.,1
Industrial Designer: And also they like curved round shapes.,1
"Industrial Designer: I like the idea of rubber too because it is tends to be associated with being durable, something that you can drop, it does not matter.",0
User Interface: Is it like a crank thing or something.,0
Marketing: let is evaluate if it is fancy or.,0
"Industrial Designer: the lower components, the power, the logic, the transmitter, the infrared, they affect you in terms of the size of your device, that would have some inte impact on how y I think more how you hold rather than the actual use using the remote control because like we have said we have defined, like we only want the basic things that to be visible, the rest of them we try to hide.",0
"User Interface: I miss a few buttons, but.",0
"Marketing: changing modes is nothing for us, but people who.",0
Project Manager: I believe that is the end of our meeting.,1
Project Manager: Project aim is a new remote control.,1
"Industrial Designer: We all had our talk, we agree I guess on several thing, on most on things.",0
"Project Manager: I'm supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board, so it is actually it is very easy.",1
"User Interface: B i basically it was saying that our labs had come up with a chip that you could, you know, say hello to, it would say hello back in a friendly female voice.",0
Marketing: The remote control has not got too much redundant or unneeded buttons.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating like the energy generator.",1
"Industrial Designer: the kinetic energy thing might work, but the same problem.",0
Industrial Designer: So It is maybe it is not very easy for.,0
Project Manager: Here we have the single curves.,1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, that is a good idea.",0
Industrial Designer: like the iPod idea that we just saw.,0
"Project Manager: but, or if it was really.",0
"Project Manager: does it mean anything to the customer? Like, it like, we do not care we do not care that you had to.",0
"Marketing: Well, we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent.",1
"Industrial Designer: I was not able to finish my personal preferences sheet, but well you know that we will have to go for the double curved 'cause it is daring, different from what we have now.",1
"Project Manager: you know, t to deliberately get away from the you know, the square look of most current remotes.",0
Industrial Designer: So we have got ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen there?,0
User Interface: And my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible.,1
"Industrial Designer: First, the younger people, they want lie soft mat materials, primary colours.",1
Industrial Designer: That is un invisible to the human eye.,0
"Marketing: Cause I know like we are going back to iPods again n the whole spinning wheel, but I have like a you know, obviously my iPod is not made of rubber, but then I have a little rubber case that goes over the top of it.",1
Marketing: Ease of use.,1
Industrial Designer: And we do not want to change that right? We really want a LCD.,0
"User Interface: you mean this would be like the overall shape of the remote control, yeah,",0
"Project Manager: Otherwise, the project becomes more complex, which endangers the time t ma the time to market.",1
User Interface: Like the one we have here.,0
"Project Manager: And if you make the single curve ha just a big curve, then it is then it is.",0
Marketing: So I think my favourite animal would be a c a cat.,0
"User Interface: But, maybe make it two, because the games are in a submenu, not it is not an entire game.",1
"Marketing: So that that is where we are gonna have to do maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons, instead of having two mute buttons.",1
"User Interface: Well, you sh you should to adjust the thing.",0
Marketing: And I hope I can also reach a lot with this project.,1
Marketing: I cover myself up.,0
"Project Manager: UID the technical functions design will, will be worked on the next thirty minutes.",1
Project Manager: We all have to use this one.,1
Project Manager: For UID the technical functions design.,1
Industrial Designer: so maybe we have to recap with this one.,1
"Marketing: The first one, I see that they put in a display.",1
"User Interface: So you have one left for the Right, the video channel, Play Station, etcetera.",1
Project Manager: So we will talk about some specific details.,1
Marketing: because it is use it.,0
Industrial Designer: We can transform the double curve into single c yeah.,1
Marketing: Trend watching I guess.,1
Industrial Designer: I have Where have I put it? My Documents or not?,0
"Industrial Designer: whereas on a piece of paper, on a computer, on a board, even with a three D graphic thing it still, it requires a lot of.",0
Project Manager: I do not think it is realistic for you to do so.,0
"Project Manager: Well the titanium is strong, the rest f the buttons feel soft.",0
"Industrial Designer: we can aim for I mean we can think about all these little things, but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life, although I do not think that it is a huge problem for remote controls anyway, battery life,",1
"Industrial Designer: Well I think that Norman, I would think about the technical points, we should discuss it in the next meeting, or.",0
Industrial Designer: I mean we have to drop on everything.,1
Marketing: And twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for RSI.,1
Project Manager: It is kind of then it.,0
"Industrial Designer: So, these are the different options that we have.",1
"Industrial Designer: So we have the regular chip on the print, which is one.",1
Project Manager: welcome everyone to our next meeting.,1
User Interface: we do not have to make it red.,0
Marketing: but there are some very pretty woods out there.,0
"Marketing: Sponginess is what they really would have wanted, apparently.",1
Marketing: So we are at seventeen dot eight.,1
"User Interface: Well I dunno about like the flipphone idea, because I think, as far as durability th it is not a big well maybe when it is closed.",1
Industrial Designer: can you go to the next sli slide please?,0
"Industrial Designer: And how much you do have to keep it moving,",0
"User Interface: Well they think it is very true, but.",0
Marketing: See you at the next meeting.,0
"Project Manager: So you were talking about We are assing that all the buttons on the second panel, the hidden away panel, would all be standard.",1
Project Manager: Anybody have anything else they'd like to bring up in this meeting?,0
"Marketing: I have done some marketing research, a lot of interviews with remote control users, some internet research.",1
"Project Manager: We can talk about the requirements, hopefully come to some decisions.",0
"User Interface: Again that is just quite boring shape, grey, looks quite spaceagey, but too many buttons, I think on that one.",1
"Project Manager: well, we were gonna what look take a look at the last sheet.",1
"Marketing: I like the idea, but we have t we have to find out.",1
Marketing: That will be too big.,1
Industrial Designer: Twelve point five is the profit on one.,0
"Industrial Designer: you could make a device, but I'm not sure how that is possible with the costs, that you can put in normal batteries, rechargeable,",0
Marketing: Well the worst ones were three point one.,1
Industrial Designer: so these are the different options that we have.,1
Industrial Designer: because the for example for Se.,0
"Marketing: that is up that is up to us to decide, eh?",0
"Marketing: Yeah, a lots lots of kids use it, touchscreen is not kids.",0
"Industrial Designer: And electrical cables, copper is all pretty basic stuff.",0
"Industrial Designer: Contextsensitive instructions, depending on what the tel what mode the TV or the DVD or something else is in.",1
"Project Manager: And then the detailed design, just more indepth, get the actual schematics of the remote.",1
"User Interface: I think we have to group, to make two groups.",0
"Marketing: See that, as we kinda noticed, seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly.",1
Project Manager: I think I have one now.,0
Project Manager: You then come back.,1
"Marketing: or should be covered, or in LCD screen.",1
"Project Manager: Which would, yeah, turn it into something far more ordinary.",1
Project Manager: so that rather than coming you know If you get the information just before the next meeting that is fine.,0
"Marketing: And same for the for the volume buttons, the t.",0
User Interface: Maybe just a button on the home station.,1
Marketing: Well the p the most important function is easy to use.,0
"User Interface: It would be a lot quicker to learn to use it, but again th it is swings, roundabouts.",1
Project Manager: so in for the case I put single curved.,1
Industrial Designer: Double curved was see ju three dimensional.,0
"Industrial Designer: it is something they do other things to like turn it on, turn it off.",0
"Project Manager: Yeah, maybe we have to integrate that as well.",1
"User Interface: Shall I give a short introduction, then.",0
Marketing: But we have a frequency of how what people use a remote control for most.,0
"Marketing: Actually, it might be an idea, if we each did give our own individual rating, we could take an average at the end.",1
Project Manager: have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or.,0
Project Manager: I think you all have been selfstimulating of working together.,0
"User Interface: So there are three kinds of designs, that is all.",1
"Project Manager: for those that did not see yet the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext, only for TV.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, there are different We have all have different home pages, with different links.",0
"Industrial Designer: But, that we will discuss later.",0
"Industrial Designer: If you have the LCD, but if n.",1
"Industrial Designer: a battery or something, to keep it going.",1
"User Interface: b well, still some question I have about how to incorporate those ones.",0
User Interface: but we also we already need the regular chip for the sample sensor speaker.,0
Marketing: The scroller a bit I think it is a one yeah.,1
Marketing: The power button got a nine.,1
User Interface: So if you want to have the conclusion as a three three.,0
Project Manager: yeah we will definitely wo not go with that one.,0
Industrial Designer: I think if we just sort of tone it down a bit.,0
Project Manager: But for the technical part.,0
Project Manager: If we are talking about the area just I d I dunno.,0
"User Interface: But of course, al also allows for the possibility of a more sort of slightly unconventional or attractive sha shape for it overall.",1
"Project Manager: And the curves which we decided,",0
User Interface: You have to add something to the rubber to make it green.,1
"Industrial Designer: As you can see, this there, there are two weird bumps in it.",1
Industrial Designer: So it is gotta be advanced.,0
"Industrial Designer: because adding wheels or scrolls makes the thing more complicated, more expensive also, so.",0
"Industrial Designer: Do they have their own do they have their own controls on their actual products, then,",1
Marketing: And the third most important aspect is to is that the co remote control should be easy to use.,0
"Project Manager: yeah, a partial, because I think elderly people may be not used to a touch screen, so they want the normal functions like teletext, vole changing, to be, yeah, kinda traditionals.",1
"User Interface: We could have the casing, the face plates.",1
Industrial Designer: So e th then a c couple of basic colours.,0
"User Interface: But do we have to We will work together, but do we have to stay here, or do we.",1
Project Manager: But that is marketing research you can you can ask.,0
"Project Manager: But all you will found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already, so it will be.",1
Marketing: So you know you know if this thing flies then we have adjusted or broken every idea they gave us.,0
"Marketing: the temporary lightup idea, sounds like we are gonna stick to that.",1
"User Interface: But yeah, but I mean already just preparing the slides before the meeting, yeah.",0
Marketing: an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancylooking remote control.,0
Industrial Designer: These things can be easily incorporated.,1
Industrial Designer: But that is with the LCD screen.,0
User Interface: is too complicated for most users.,1
Marketing: And some basic colour fronts.,0
Marketing: So the design of our remote control is very important.,1
"Industrial Designer: we are talking this the simple, cheapest version at the same time.",0
"User Interface: and maybe move ahead with the project, without the solar cell.",1
Industrial Designer: Here we go.,0
"User Interface: Well, what about this what about if you can programme in your favourite channels into this scroll wheel, you can just like roll through your favourite channels,",0
Project Manager: You are going to work together on a prototype drawing on the SMARTboard.,0
"Marketing: So, is this a goodlooking remote? Would we wanna show it off to our friends?",0
Industrial Designer: Fill in the questionnaire.,1
"User Interface: Store up to eighty speech samples, controls four devices, TV, cable, satellite, VCR, DVD, audio.",0
User Interface: It is in yeah it was integrateds.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, so you have the thumb kind of here.",0
Marketing: It is yeah but it I do not think it is such a problem just putting the logo somewhere.,0
"Industrial Designer: And finally that is how we put the fashion back into electronics,",0
Industrial Designer: Maybe we can can do it both.,0
"User Interface: Because you need to you n you need to put all the technology in, so I mean if the case you add the case, it becomes a bit bulky.",1
User Interface: that will activate the remote control starts to beep.,0
User Interface: Can I not just do each one in order?,0
Project Manager: The little R yellow thing?.,0
"Marketing: Six, so it is five point five, or less.",0
Industrial Designer: it is the iPod kind of.,0
"User Interface: even if the design kind of changes,",0
Marketing: But it is a tough one.,0
Project Manager: some from personal experience which look nice.,0
"Project Manager: Maybe if you change if you take the buttons out, maybe do things like that.",1
Industrial Designer: So this was on the web site.,1
"Project Manager: So maybe we should implement the audio sign, or something.",1
Marketing: Or a clap.,0
"Marketing: We could do it as we d go along, the production costs, looking at the prototype.",1
Industrial Designer: why did not I think of fish? That is even easier to draw than cat.,0
Industrial Designer: Did not think of that.,0
Project Manager: So what is a single curve then?,0
"Project Manager: Can you just push pen, then keep on.",0
"Project Manager: you will be working, Poppy will be working on the lookandfeel design.",1
"User Interface: But if you have already got the remote control in your hand you need to open the flip to use the voice, why use the voice, why not just use your hand? I mean the whole point of the voice is that if the remote control is sitting there, I'm too lazy to reach over, pick it up, I can just use my voice.",1
User Interface: It should be possible.,0
User Interface: I i if it is a simple p.,0
User Interface: I have I had a lot of picture of old ones.,0
Industrial Designer: So we discussed an Excuse me.,0
Industrial Designer: So like when you press a one on one TV it go to one.,0
"User Interface: So instead of pressing the channel nber, I am choosing the programmes directly.",1
Project Manager: So you must be careful with with all this.,0
"Project Manager: So you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever, then you could have additional features in you know like a You'd have model one, model two, model three, therefore you can subdivide your market up.",1
Marketing: But it seems that trends travel across things.,1
Industrial Designer: And the button button is part will be explained by F Francina.,0
Industrial Designer: And They say a display requires an advanced chip.,0
"User Interface: whereas if you are in a store, you ca not unless you are a highly imaginative person, you may not really know what it is you want,",0
Project Manager: For typing in your channels.,1
"Industrial Designer: And this has to be harder, because when it falls, it mu must not burst.",1
"Marketing: so in conclusion, we need a our remote control needs to be something that is really fancy, has lots of technolog tech technology in it.",0
"User Interface: I just do not know about that, because in order to do that in order to price it at that kind of level I think we'd need to have every functionality that all the other competitors are offering like being able to operate, you know, the DVD player, you know, the stereo system, all that.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, you can guess what it is.",1
"Project Manager: so when we have a good product we we could meet this aim, I think.",0
Project Manager: So now it is time for us to going to discuss a little things.,0
"Project Manager: And user, that is you S Steph, for the technical functions design, for marketing the user requirements specification.",1
Project Manager: It is very easy to use.,1
Project Manager: the specifi specific instructions for the next meeting you will all will receive at the the email.,0
"Marketing: but I mean it has been proven that people of that age group have a higher disposable income because they do not have like I mean, you know, if you are at university, you are paying your rent,",0
Project Manager: we will get on with it.,0
Project Manager: we will have to take advantage of these two things.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, that is a bit technical, I had not I w I was a little short on time.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, but wood is not a not a material you which you build a remote control of.",0
"User Interface: We have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost, but for like we had g s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it.",1
Marketing: That is why I say I do not I do not see the market niche for this.,0
"User Interface: so I think things like you know keeping buttons together that like close together that are used in the same way, or maybe that making 'em the same colour, keeping the nber of buttons the leas you know to a minim, also things like is it is it is it can you c y small enough large enough I'm not sure we c I guess we would need to do some research about, I would, about what size is appropriate, that sort of thing, but basically we need to make sure that it turns on, off the TV.",1
"Project Manager: Twentyfive Euros is the selling price, we really have to innovate here I guess.",1
Industrial Designer: Yeah we did not design that.,0
"Industrial Designer: So I think you have a problem when you are watching a movie, you have not moved the remote i remote control in a in an amount of time, you want t to switch the channel or something,",0
User Interface: Cause most of them will just be kind of mainly circular or like very plain.,1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, that would be probably best, yeah.",0
"Project Manager: what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is now that we know what it is that we are doing, now we know that it is a TV remote, stuff, you guys have just been off doing some R, D for that, that is research, development for those that have not heard that before,",0
User Interface: So that was just an idea I had.,0
"Industrial Designer: These are the three scroll buttons which are already available with us in the company, we can go ahead with that.",0
"User Interface: But we have elderly people, so we need to keep it simple.",1
Marketing: cause I have to do an average.,1
User Interface: It is a cartoon dog I think.,0
"Industrial Designer: This remote costs nothing, you know.",0
"Industrial Designer: The question is also, I dunno, d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it?",1
"Project Manager: yh we have lunch break,",1
"Marketing: No it is like this,",0
User Interface: These are two examples.,1
Marketing: We could make a lot of different remote controls.,0
"Project Manager: So, starting off with the last the last one, I do not have it here, but we talked about energy, we are gonna use a kinetic battery, we want to use a simple chip, because we are not gonna need a shuffle, we are gonna need a scroll, we are choosing a latex case w in fruity colours that is curved, we are using push buttons with a supplement of an onscreen menu.",1
"Marketing: things like channel, vole are used all the time, so we just have them right out on top, very just very sort of selfexplanatory.",1
"Industrial Designer: For our next product, our new TV set with automatical sound adjustment light.",0
"Marketing: Especially the volume buttons, the channel buttes buttons, the number buttons to zap through the channels.",1
"User Interface: 'Cause remote con control, you can see it here, you have to bo reach both out both sides.",1
Marketing: It needs to be not functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment.,1
"Industrial Designer: it is like two types no? people are right handed or left handed so y because I am left handed I use like this, say if you are right handed you use like this.",0
"Project Manager: that seems to make sense, but if it turns out that it is hugely expensive we'd have to cut down somewhere else, then it is worth thinking about.",0
"Project Manager: Well but that is also useful for the evaluation, because I think we have a prototype now.",0
Industrial Designer: Shall we Well I think all of them should have an RR.,1
Project Manager: and the marketing expert with the product evaluation.,1
"Project Manager: so we will try to zip through this, since we are short on time.",0
"Marketing: Nay that that is true, that is true.",0
Industrial Designer: I will come to that later.,0
Marketing: The initial plan.,1
"Project Manager: so maybe Anna, you can have your presentation.",1
"Project Manager: When it falls over it, I just have then the button that I use most has to be here.",0
"User Interface: Yeah, but it ha does not has the digits.",0
"User Interface: Does it have to be functional, trendy, user friendly?",0
"Industrial Designer: I I have I think we have succe succeed in developing a product that is actually quite good, but not for this kind of market, not for this kind of price.",1
Industrial Designer: Because the zapping buttons are not used then if you are in the menu.,0
Marketing: I would say that is ex excellent in terms of w much we adhere to the ideals of the market place.,0
Industrial Designer: I would go for the double curved.,1
"Project Manager: So that would show that volume was going up, whereas the one underneath would see the volume going down.",0
"Marketing: personally I wi I think that in terms of trends, these products are quite good, like, these products are in fruit shape, because that wha people now our fashion trend shows that people like everything all f everything that is being advertised, like clothes, shoes, everything is being advertised in the form of fruits, vegetables, or getting them or showing some association with them.",1
Industrial Designer: maybe to keep in mind maybe to access to that menu you should do something like that.,1
"Industrial Designer: you just need one 'cause you have already got all the numbers there anyway,",0
"Project Manager: Yeah, but you do not underst you do not understand my point.",0
User Interface: Well I dunno what I woulda shown on that board.,1
"User Interface: There was children is remote, where they just had a very limited range of buttons, they were b bright, colourful, you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels.",0
"User Interface: But if you do not put it back in, you press something like a little button on that, that just sort of sends out a beep to find where it is or something.",1
"User Interface: I mean, we said simplicity is one of the features, so it is going to appeal to people, maybe people who have problems with technology, you know, people who get scared by having lots of buttons,",1
"Project Manager: you are Industrial, you are User Interface.",0
"User Interface: But if you have a normal on button on the on the remote, then you do the on, then you search the channel which you want.",1
Marketing: Because we still hold on to the ordinary square remote control.,0
"Marketing: the characteristics I talk about, we have reliability, we have comfort, we have ergonomics, we have environmentally s sensitive.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, where are going to where are you are you going to place them?",0
User Interface: If they read a manual.,1
"Project Manager: We could have used it more efficiently,",1
"User Interface: you ca not have a t there is no point having a television that you ca not tune or that you ca not set the contrast, so we need to find a way of including these somehow.",1
Industrial Designer: because my information says it.,0
"User Interface: If we knew that before, we could have had discussion really s really quicker.",1
"Marketing: That would be that would be I think a decision best made by corporate I m for my evaluation, based on what our competition is, I th I think that we can go after this, go after more of the exclusivity sense than the mass market sense.",1
"Marketing: So for instance if I want to go to directly to channel twenty five, how would I do can I do that with this?",1
"User Interface: Yeah, so each of us has a role to do.",1
Project Manager: And we have think I got a new project requirement.,1
"User Interface: The user can choose w which one they want, right?",0
Project Manager: So we should we should keep The product should be recognisable.,0
"Industrial Designer: Well, it can be whatever you want.",0
"Marketing: I know, it becomes ridiculous, yes I know.",0
Project Manager: I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun.,1
"User Interface: If I had t if I had to spend twenty five Euro, if that was like my limit, maybe I would buy it.",1
"Marketing: I think so, with our LCD screen, docking station, scrollbuttons.",1
Industrial Designer: Maybe we could think of the cases like changing with the fashions.,0
"Project Manager: And with the with the with the motto, we put fashion in electronics.",1
Project Manager: maybe some Asian countries.,0
Marketing: I had only one document left.,0
"Project Manager: Well, it is kind of gotta be our company is yellow.",0
User Interface: Like we should maybe try to discourage people from standby.,1
"Industrial Designer: so Raj told us that consers are willing to spend more for fancy products, he also mentioned that the current products do not always match users' operating behaviour.",0
"User Interface: It is still it is still working, your daughter got a bonus.",0
Project Manager: But that is not our part.,0
"User Interface: So we should first decide about shape, I think.",1
"User Interface: So you have just to make one standard remote control, yeah you can sell few.",0
Industrial Designer: It is not so bad so.,0
"User Interface: once we have chosen a concept for it, we can then design the features around the concept, making sure that we get all the essential functions in the device, the extra functions, the more advanced features.",1
Project Manager: We have a technical problem.,0
Marketing: Special colour? Yeah.,0
Marketing: We are gonna go to our other room again.,0
Marketing: So has to be yellow.,1
Marketing: this product is for all sorts of customers.,1
"Project Manager: And last but not least, or indeed first of all, it must make the company money, we make the company money by producing what the conser wants.",1
Project Manager: so so well done for the presentations.,0
Project Manager: Like a old buttons.,0
"Industrial Designer: Nah, it is not really only an extra.",0
Marketing: Now we just gotta calculate.,1
"Marketing: So I'm just thinking, before I give it my rating, you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here.",1
"Marketing: will people return the remote control, I think a lot of young people will buy the remote control, if they have the money, you know, so,",1
Project Manager: Hear from the User Interface Designer now I think might be an idea.,0
Industrial Designer: It could cause another type of repetitive stress injury though.,0
Project Manager: The power button can be.,0
"Project Manager: But I mean, general TV controls do video as well.",0
"Industrial Designer: maybe you can use in the end,",0
Industrial Designer: Like a f banana kind of front.,0
Project Manager: and then i it looks quite conventional.,1
"Industrial Designer: one is the visibility in the dark, which was Genevieve is idea.",1
"Marketing: Could be shaped like a conch,",0
"User Interface: And then there is there are only six buttons for six categories, or sev seven.",1
Industrial Designer: The supplement is.,0
"Industrial Designer: But I dunno, but why, nobody is a threat to me.",1
"Industrial Designer: it does this by well, you need to start off you need an energy source this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit chip, the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages within the remote which will then be sent to the the television, the DVD to tell that what to do.",1
"Project Manager: It'd be nice if everything was wireless, would not it?",0
"Marketing: Yeah, with an LCD screen you can.",1
"User Interface: but you could you could o you could turn it turn it on by taking the top off the banana maybe, you know, it is kind of like a spy kind of flick thing.",1
Project Manager: time for another animal.,0
"User Interface: probably something that s sits in your hand comfortably, sort of feels right in your hand.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, I'm not sure if we we Because I saw something about individual actions.",0
Project Manager: I think I just kicked over whatever it runs on underneath as well.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, I think it is a disadvantage.",0
Project Manager: See how it works.,1
"Marketing: That sounds pretty good, yeah.",1
Project Manager: this our last meeting.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, just a blank sheet.",0
"Marketing: But i it had a lot of buttons on it, you did not know which one was what.",0
"Industrial Designer: Ah yeah, we could add things.",1
"Project Manager: Try out the whiteboard, every participant should draw their favourite animal, sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal.",1
"User Interface: Well, wou I think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing,",1
Project Manager: I think we can discuss a little about the three kind of revolutionary things Tim came with.,0
"Project Manager: So, that great.",0
User Interface: So that is my presentation.,0
User Interface: we have five or four or something.,0
User Interface: More like the MP three player M P M P three player.,1
"User Interface: Whereas otherwise we'd thought, like with this one or mix, match, just we were gonna see what you thought, the a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons.",1
Marketing: Which is participant four.,0
"User Interface: Yeah the power button is a bit of a reach, but I think we might scale down the final model a bit.",1
"Industrial Designer: Just in case you are wondering, why is he still playing with the PlayDoh?",0
Project Manager: And so specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach.,1
Project Manager: B as soon as possible.,0
"User Interface: S And it is one of those very light, very touchable displays.",1
Industrial Designer: I mean like the.,0
Marketing: it is nice.,0
Marketing: So Maybe we watch the first the next two presentations.,0
Marketing: So we can Is it fine? So what about company strategy?,0
User Interface: I think there is just one button so.,0
Industrial Designer: Speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use.,1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, it is a three,",0
Industrial Designer: but you could I thin there is a possibility to g to to put those buttons behind some kind of protection.,0
"Project Manager: We then have a finance aspect, which is a spreadsheet, an Excel spreadsheet.",1
"Marketing: If we want something new, we need to move away from what we already have, just go creative.",1
User Interface: Now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television.,1
"Industrial Designer: And also rubber because the younger people lie that, what we see in the research.",1
Industrial Designer: I with some remote controls the buttons were a little small so they are quite hard to press so maybe we make something with easy to press buttons.,0
"Project Manager: So, I like to use the ones on the top.",0
Marketing: But obviously the board tends to disagree.,0
"Industrial Designer: yeah, we had to buy one.",0
"Industrial Designer: it is about well two dollars to produce the microphone, speech recognition systems.",0
"Project Manager: Yeah, we have the wheel.",0
Project Manager: So I think but th do you agree th that thi.,0
"Marketing: So I do not know that really that is gonna be a d problem, 'cause the television can go automatically from channel five to channel thirty two with the push of a button.?",1
Project Manager: we I think we have problem.,0
"Industrial Designer: Well, that that is one possibility.",0
"Industrial Designer: the manufacturing division also has said that they have several types of chips, they have just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip, which we could utilise.",1
"Industrial Designer: So we are to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we will use for energy, the material, interface.",0
"Marketing: Instead of people entering in what time things start, you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins,",1
Project Manager: so you will have to model something.,0
"User Interface: just that my method was to look at the, well, my inspirations, which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls, other things that use a similar sort of thing, including MP three players, like you know, hifi remotes, not just television, these things.",1
"Marketing: For the functional requirements, especially for the for the user requirements.",0
Marketing: So we need to take care of them in the design.,1
"Project Manager: We will stay here, break off.",0
"Industrial Designer: can either use a hand dynamo, or the kinetic type ones, you know that they use in watches, or else a solar powered one.",1
User Interface: This is pretty standard remote.,1
Industrial Designer: I do not think it is enough.,0
"User Interface: I mean the thing is we do need to develop our technology of I mean actually how to program the menus, what sort of, you know, text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen,",1
"Marketing: Can I just run this past you while it occurs to me, I do not mean to quickly jp from one subject to another, but just discussing the different age groups, targeting the different age groups it occurs to me, to produce our own mobile phones, that that is kind of what led us on to comparing TV remote controls with their design features, chain companies like Carphone Warehouse, you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you have got any problems with it, they will fix it,",1
"Marketing: Yeah, well then that is covered.",0
"Industrial Designer: The remote determines what button it is, uses the infrared to send a signal to the TV.",1
User Interface: I ha I ha I have the I have.,0
Marketing: but then i then we are told use the co company colours.,0
"Industrial Designer: Material, we want them rubber as well probably, yeah.",1
Marketing: You can you can ma.,0
"Industrial Designer: I mean you can bring your paperwork along, p Well of course if you have a lot of paper.",0
"User Interface: It might be useful to have some kind of base station, even if it is just you press on a button on it, the remote control starts beeping, you know, this is a way of finding the remote.",1
"Project Manager: So if we go for the simple push button, so effectively we are going for the simple printed circuit board are we? Or are we going for the regular?",1
"Project Manager: finally there is more marketing, I think, our corporate image has to be recognisable.",1
"Project Manager: Well, in this one, you have actually got three colours of buttons.",1
"User Interface: We have very little options furthermore, for the.",0
"Marketing: And then if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points, fancy look, feel has, on a score of seven would have six as importance.",1
"Project Manager: We will just deliver it in black, have the it has all the function that it is supposed to have, if you want it if you want the custom design, then you can buy the separate covers.",1
"Project Manager: So anything that is to be added, such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple, has to be very quick.",0
"Marketing: Right, the triple As are the smallest you can get are they not, right?",1
User Interface: A red one.,0
Project Manager: Well I yeah.,0
Project Manager: Now first the opening.,1
"Marketing: Please bear in mind this is only a hundred people, so even when the groups are divided into fifteen to twenty five, twenty five to thirty five, there is only maybe ten people fifteen people in each group.",1
"Industrial Designer: But then, I think the idea of one person entering it, the rest discussing it, that is not that bad idea, actually.",0
"Industrial Designer: I first chose for the battery, 'cause yeah I'm traditional, that is the most obvious, easiest choice to go to.",1
User Interface: I will put it here.,0
"User Interface: Too much text, it gets too busy.",0
"Project Manager: We will just run through it yeah, yeah.",0
Industrial Designer: and it is got a fairly big label on the bottom saying where it comes from.,0
"Marketing: What about like batteries, things like that, like are there some remotes that don do not require like batteries or do all remotes require batteries?",0
User Interface: On the lower side I think it you have to turn it.,0
"Marketing: I mean what I see one of the things one of the things you brought up in an earlier presentation is, when you got children, their stuff gets inside the circuitry, they get dirty, they get messy with drinks, stuff.",1
Project Manager: we just take that one.,0
"Marketing: So we have true? One, t Seven, eight.",0
User Interface: You can make it m larger.,0
User Interface: You have more there as well.,0
User Interface: but I guess you could use it as as a way to implement.,0
"Project Manager: The button has a special colour, the frame has a special colour.",1
"Marketing: No, not fronts, but different designs.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, maybe two scroll wheel, as we have the coarse to fine scroll wheel.",1
Project Manager: Well think I had the best solution that I came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition.,1
"Marketing: And that way, you do not have a lot of buttons over.",0
"Marketing: Do we already have a cost limit on this, th an idea of how much we want to market this for, how much it is gonna sell for,",1
"Marketing: Is it the effective size, weight that the Is it real size, real weight? Or Because it.",0
Industrial Designer: It is silly.,0
"Project Manager: I mean it is kind of, our design.",0
"Project Manager: then we will do the evaluation, then we can finish up after that with any changes that we will need to make, or hopefully everything will fall right in line.",0
"Industrial Designer: I do not know how it works but I guess that something got sent out, have like a brief to kind of.",0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, well, as you saw, we would just have the basic remote with the panel LCD screen.",0
"Marketing: or like a gunmetal grey,",1
Marketing: I only speak for myself though.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah I think it should be a little distinct from everything else,",0
User Interface: or you can build in when you press one button.,0
Industrial Designer: Yeah you could y It leaves more space for creativity.,1
"Marketing: I do not I do not know what the decision to be made is, but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers, young professionals, most likely, but we should discuss this together.",0
"Marketing: Yeah it should be available, but then in separate screen settings or something.",1
Industrial Designer: Fo for a docking station.,0
Industrial Designer: Somehow the mechanism inside powers up through movement.,1
"Project Manager: Our fourth, last meeting.",0
"Marketing: Is it worthwhile with our retail outlets having a similar kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this, if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets, th you know, which button is it I press for this? Th as free as a free aspect of our service, would that not make it more attractive to them?",1
"Project Manager: Because otherwise we are just going to I mean even if it is necessary or not, if you if you are given the choice between a t a remote with teletext or without when it really if it i if it is not more expensive for us to mae because as far as I understand it, it can be operated with the same set of buttons, yeah? So it should be in there.",1
Marketing: I think we should scrap the sample speaker.,1
Marketing: By innovativeness this means functions which are not featured in other remote controls.,0
"Project Manager: And the buttons, well we talked about it now.",0
"Project Manager: give some examples of the tool training, project plan discussion, the closing.",1
Project Manager: So And it is good for the design as well.,0
"Project Manager: Even then as well, there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick so I have used what I think is appropriate.",1
Marketing: so that is a one.,0
"Project Manager: the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap, so we could make it red, we could make it psychedelic, you know, we could make it black, white zebra stripes,",1
"User Interface: they are nice, kinda clearly labelled.",0
"Marketing: I do not see why, but.",0
"Industrial Designer: I'd like first to give a quick a very simple introduction, how does it work, so that everybody knows even if you do not have a very technical background what is it because I think in the product it is important.",1
"User Interface: Shall we go for single curve, just to compromise?",1
"Project Manager: That was in cutting down the nber that was kinda separate that was cutting down the nber of functions, making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date.",0
User Interface: So that is what I'm saying.,0
"Project Manager: So how do you turn the thing on? There has to be a on button on the remote,",1
"Project Manager: It might be yellow, because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere.",1
"Project Manager: the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a LCD, at which point we have removed a large part of how we were gonna interface, require more buttons, etcetera.",0
Industrial Designer: And then hit that little folder up thing again.,0
User Interface: I mean this is plasticene.,0
Industrial Designer: but it is still Yeah al alright.,0
Industrial Designer: Now this is the simple version.,0
"Industrial Designer: findings, we are very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer, my question to all of you is, should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available?",0
Industrial Designer: what do we think a.,0
Project Manager: I think we did pretty well as teamwork though.,1
"Marketing: Yeah, remember the user is not happy to read the.",0
"User Interface: There are disadvantages, you ca not use it say to freeze the television picture.",0
"User Interface: And I definitely support the use of plastic, or rubber.",1
"Marketing: The next channel in the numeric pattern, or.",0
Industrial Designer: You do not have to hold it.,0
Industrial Designer: Although I have not come up with the final circuit yet.,0
Marketing: Thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it.,1
"Industrial Designer: And I felt the first two meetings, that I was coming in with no information,",1
"Industrial Designer: But, what l what Jarek said, you could you could use a battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves.",1
"Marketing: I mean i if you if it would cost two Euros, that had a total a total thing, it would be nice too, I mean we are not gonna add a trip to Hawaii to it.",1
"Marketing: Just browse through it, then in some kind of way see if it if it if it is programmed.",0
"Project Manager: So is you should have a menu for all the functions you do not use regular, which are.",0
"User Interface: Yeah, I think there was very constructive feedback by everybody.",0
"Project Manager: but if I would say a three, then it is six, four is ten.",0
"User Interface: But the rest is you do not use that often, so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it, it should be clear as well.",1
Project Manager: But do you need the buttons for one to zero.,1
"User Interface: It'd be more compatible with a range of television sets, making it more internationally sellable.",1
Project Manager: you can see on the So we have to know what we are going to put on.,1
"Project Manager: You have to work on the look, feel design, you have to work on the user interface, in fact you two you have to work together to model the first f first prototype.",0
"Industrial Designer: And now we have we also decided on the inside, we could possibly either have some kind of sort of bezzled logo on it, or something inset, or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top.",1
"Project Manager: If we if we add the time, we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that, is it very useful? I mean, are users wants to have the time on the on the remote?",1
Industrial Designer: I bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too.,1
"User Interface: But that is also in the LCD,",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, why not? If it is.",0
Project Manager: Yeah but there are also design cost.,1
"Marketing: Yeah, I kn I mean I know what you are saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds,",0
"Industrial Designer: we could do f a cherry cover for this year, then i if next year is stripes or solids, you know.",0
"Industrial Designer: So, four point three point five, it means it is acceptable.",0
"Marketing: Fancy look, feel, that is good.",0
"Project Manager: or something like a flip telephone, something like that maybe.",1
Industrial Designer: Simple plusminus button.,1
"Project Manager: So we should target selling price of twentyfive Euro for this remote control, we have which would generate a profit of fifty million Euros.",0
Marketing: Hey now I understand the random like newsclippings.,0
User Interface: it it is supposed to be bit s bit s bit.,0
Industrial Designer: And of course the energy source.,0
Marketing: I think our priority really should be unique design.,1
"User Interface: Just I mean I like the one on the right better, just because it does have fewer buttons, but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like like colour, you know size, shapes, that sort of thing, to best fit the user.",1
Project Manager: I think I would give it a two.,0
"Project Manager: tool training, we are going to, I guess, figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles.",1
"Project Manager: But I wanna start with stuff you did first, so we can see what everybody came up with.",0
"User Interface: It is looks like some mushroom, so we call it mushroom design.",1
"Project Manager: Paul, was there room for crea creativity?",0
"Marketing: You know, it is like I find a lot of TVs these days, something really like about 'em is if you wanna just turn 'em on, off you can, but they have little panels where you click, there is just like tons of features you go through.",0
Industrial Designer: we obviously do not want wires on this thing.,0
"Marketing: Yeah, it might be useful for drawings.",1
Industrial Designer: We should do it.,0
"User Interface: And if you see for example righ right now even the one on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine, but tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows, but.",1
"User Interface: And it is got just few buttons, quite low looking, all this stuff we already we already discussed.",1
"Project Manager: what we will do is now we will take for lunch break, then we can discuss furthermore, with our areas, then we will come back again in the in the next meeting.",0
"Project Manager: which is quite amusing, so.",0
"Project Manager: Thank you Christine for time being,",1
Industrial Designer: A two? I think it is two.,1
"Project Manager: And by the way, Mister David Jordan, please record your presentations in your own folder.",1
User Interface: As you also notice it is quite a boring design.,0
Marketing: It is b bi little bit too big to write.,0
Marketing: will it be easy to use?,1
"Project Manager: If it is within our price to get that kind of chip that would, you know, technology.",0
"User Interface: But for standard actions you usually what do you do, you change channels, you adjust volume, nothing else.",1
Industrial Designer: I like titanium.,1
Industrial Designer: fel look at it from the side.,0
"Marketing: I think it is a one, I think.",0
"User Interface: Are we supposed to do this right now, do you think, or?",0
Marketing: let is first watch Paul is presentation first then.,0
Industrial Designer: If we use the speech recognition.,0
User Interface: So in that case well it is fine then.,0
"Marketing: Yeah, I think then it would be way more popular with younger people than it is, than would be with older people.",1
Project Manager: So everybody is with the changing covers? I think that is a good good option.,0
Industrial Designer: Its a sort of bunny rabbit cat.,1
"Industrial Designer: Everybody can use it, so that is easy to use.",0
Project Manager: I think that the logo could be smaller.,1
"User Interface: and probably this one that people complain about, about having too many buttons that you do not use.",0
"Marketing: So we have to safety point of view also, we have to take care.",1
"Project Manager: And if it does not work you know, we have just made a lemon.",0
"Project Manager: Well, I mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it, does not it.",1
Project Manager: Then I believe each of you have a presentation.,1
"User Interface: And in terms of invisible features, audio, tactile feedback on button presses, like you said, speech recognition.",1
"Project Manager: it goes Yeah, but that is kind of stuff we should do on the internet right now.",0
"Project Manager: I think I will let our User Interface Designer speak first, Mister David Jordan.",1
"Project Manager: Let is see, we can save this now.",0
"Project Manager: What do we This Quick What we are going to Selling price, twenty five Euros.",1
"Marketing: I searched the web, I searched on this d document, recent investigation of the remote control market.",1
"User Interface: So most people want to have a remote for their hifi, TV, stuff like that.",0
Project Manager: So you can change any colour you want.,0
"User Interface: A single function remote control is simpler to use, but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices.",1
"Industrial Designer: it was the idea to be creative, so.",1
Project Manager: So that was that was my idea on what we could do to appeal this product to everyone.,1
"Marketing: And just put it under the screen, the screen.",0
"Industrial Designer: I yeah, I looked up on was the LCD displays.",0
"Industrial Designer: you can do a banana in single curve,",1
User Interface: We could lose the curve.,1
Project Manager: ' then the case is a Probably it is double curved.,0
Project Manager: So we I guess we use one.,0
"Marketing: I will make a note of that, Kate.",0
Project Manager: I'm not sure the one in the middle is very attractive.,1
Marketing: I mean it hides all those function.,1
"Marketing: Yeah, so yes.",0
Marketing: Integrated scrollwheel pushbutton.,1
Marketing: I find it quite cheap actually.,1
"User Interface: I mean it looks just like a logo, that arrangement of the keys.",0
Project Manager: we will issue some information from all of you.,0
User Interface: D are we including the voice are you glu are we including the voice in the end or not? Huh?,0
"Marketing: Yeah, the To implement some spongy thing, maybe we can do it in the in the docking station.",1
"User Interface: so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand, then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need.",1
Project Manager: As well for the for the older people?,0
"Marketing: and Yeah, whatever.",0
"User Interface: So, for example you have presently keys like one, two, three like this, actually, four five six like that, you can have keys like this in form like keys like that.",1
"Industrial Designer: So, we could, so we have got flex flexibility with colours, things, with that as well.",1
Project Manager: The interface is pushbuttons.,0
"Project Manager: I know that like people have like things they can put on their keys that you press it, it will beep, but I but I'm sure that would require some kind of technology.",0
"Project Manager: So maybe we can jump to your presentations, right now.",0
Industrial Designer: maybe you should just s start on a blank page.,0
"Project Manager: But w maybe we should put some func, I know that the younger people will most likely have a DVD player they want to, you know, they want to.",1
Industrial Designer: We have the technology to do that.,0
"Industrial Designer: So there was there were many other materials like wood, titanium, all those things, but plastic is I think is the most appropriate one,",1
Project Manager: So I I thank you all very much.,1
"Project Manager: but end of the day, you are the sales guy, so I will come back, sit on your head because you are going to give your sales projection,",1
User Interface: It is a pretty simple design.,0
"Project Manager: Our functions, we have so far decided, I think, that power, channel, volume make it attractive.",1
Industrial Designer: We all agree on that.,1
"User Interface: I think something coloured, yeah, probably.",1
Marketing: You just you just find out.,0
User Interface: And all curves have already been done.,0
User Interface: So I mean this is also one of the n dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include.,1
"Project Manager: that is what you will need for our first exercise, because I'm going to ask you to draw your favourite animal.",0
"Marketing: Now I'm not saying we should have, you know, tomato shaped remote controls or anything, but I think it is possible maybe to use natural colours, like if wood is an option, that whole organic, sleek, clean,",1
"Project Manager: I think I have got minutes for two of the meeting, the last thingy.",0
Industrial Designer: And as well as I could see on the web the scroll button is becoming really hot thing s.,0
"Marketing: I have done some investigation, well I got some information from fashion watchers from Paris, Milan.",0
Project Manager: So So I will ask you all to do the same.,1
Project Manager: so thoughts about the actual shape of the thing.,0
Industrial Designer: I wanted to explain the working design of the remote control.,1
"Marketing: But if you c if you could scroll through the channels, then the volume would just be.",0
"Industrial Designer: I'd assume, like, an internal light, that comes through.",1
"User Interface: Now our design team, research team, has been able to set up a system in which you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to with standard responses.",1
Marketing: I would break it.,1
Marketing: And old users not.,1
"Industrial Designer: typically it would be a battery, but I'm open to suggestions.",1
"Project Manager: Kate, why do not you try it first, if you can either bring your things with you, I guess.",1
"Industrial Designer: so you can go, press that button, the remote control, wherever it is, it will beep,",1
Marketing: well it stands for the use of technical features that do not exist in current remote controls.,0
"Project Manager: 'Cause that is something we have to decide, is whether we want to have VCR capabilities.",1
Project Manager: So presumably that might be an idea to put into.,1
Marketing: Well That would make it less appealing.,0
User Interface: I do not really know about the voice recognition thing.,0
"User Interface: so I'm the interface design designer, User Interface Designer sorry, I'm concerned with w what effect the apparatus should have on the user, I'm also I want to point out that our motto, put the fashion in electronics,",1
Project Manager: Could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off? So then w we would not have to have like a dual function?,0
"Industrial Designer: No not this, but the task.",0
"Project Manager: So you have a but button on your docking station which you can push, then it starts beeping.",1
Project Manager: So we have got tool training.,0
Project Manager: Swap is good option.,0
User Interface: how do I press n just the next button?,0
"Project Manager: I'm responsible for leading the meetings, keeping the notes, coming up with the final presentation.",1
"Project Manager: So like I said, changing channels, everything hidden in your LCD display, so you just need the navigation buttons to do everything.",1
User Interface: And I think your leadership was quite good.,1
"Project Manager: In thirty minutes, but I think it will be you will be warned through your laptop to get over here.",0
User Interface: With one integrated button we can do the whole menu thing.,0
Marketing: Cherry would be alright actually.,1
"Project Manager: becau b l a lot of remote controls work that y when y that you when you fir you push the one first, then you have a couple of seconds.",1
Project Manager: We are targeting TV.,0
Project Manager: Because we have a problem.,1
"User Interface: Yeah, then you can use a timer as well.",0
Project Manager: So maybe we can put a six.,1
Marketing: It is pretty nice.,0
"Project Manager: so Right well from the last meeting I was trying to send you the minutes, but it did not work out too well, so maybe in sort of quick smary of the last meeting, I can quickly give you what we what we had.",1
User Interface: And this one is just pointing out.,1
User Interface: that is what we do not want.,0
"Project Manager: But if you lose the joystick, it is still an advanced chip?",1
"Marketing: so the bottom bit is just, covers half the keys most of the time, then you can slide the cover back to get to the more advanced keys.",1
Industrial Designer: Then this is an option.,0
"Project Manager: Obviously it will have a logo on it just like everything, but everything else has a logo on it.",0
"User Interface: You train it for a certain, for a certain phrase, you say the example they said that they have up, running with their prototype is well they have actually integrated into the into the coffee machine that that we are producing is, you can say good morning to the coffee machine, it can recognize that phrase, it will playback good morning, how would you like your coffee?",0
"Industrial Designer: well, m it might not work.",0
"Project Manager: And Well it has to be a have the right the right buttons on the right place, that kin those kind of things.",1
Industrial Designer: I mean I much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form.,1
"User Interface: And the mouse one, I thought it was a good idea, because people use mo mice mouses now with the scrolling thing.",1
"Marketing: Well I guess I'm not with it, because I was not But it is, it is being used fourteen times an hour.",1
Project Manager: You find out information.,1
Project Manager: So that is a lot.,0
Marketing: It is a f basic.,0
"Project Manager: So, we want something fancy, as previously said, Florent, something very easy to use, powerful, also as it is written here, seventy five percent of users, they zap lot, so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot.",1
Industrial Designer: We also have a apple slash cherry design at the top.,1
User Interface: A simple chip is required to operate push buttons.,1
User Interface: It wo not stand out.,0
"Project Manager: so if you can add the feature, for your fabric whatever in your outline design, with unbreakable, I think that will give a lot of advantage for our product, if I'm not wrong.",1
"Project Manager: I will try to show it to everyone, that would be more comfortable.",1
"Project Manager: so if we want something that looks good, is easy to use, but has y is fairly powerful product, whatever, who do we really want to aim that at?",1
Marketing: It should be available but not.,1
"User Interface: yes, I would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser.",1
Marketing: Of course in that we could put LCD or recognition to be more technologically innovative.,1
"Industrial Designer: If we want the nice cheap one, the simple, then we can only have push buttons.",1
"Industrial Designer: But yeah, about the speech thing, it does not have to be hand held or close.",1
Industrial Designer: Everybody knows how a remote works.,1
"Marketing: It is an option, but actually there is I have got some research already on like what we are looking at, trends in casing right now.",0
"User Interface: so you have got a lot of devi devices like DVD television, stereo.",0
"Marketing: Yeah, I was gonna say thirty five to fifty.",1
"Project Manager: now I think we will do this I could do you know, I can do this o on my own or I could do it with you,",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, I think four maybe would be appropriate, because it is Yeah, maybe it really depends on taste.",1
"Project Manager: because you have a I know some remote controls that do not have these buttons, but you still can, know, obviously you can still select the twenty a number in the twenty or in the ten.",1
Marketing: I mean this one seems.,1
Project Manager: I would say to.,1
"User Interface: Yeah, we can we can put a seven here.",1
"Marketing: One, I have to expla explain something.",0
User Interface: For young people I think it is easy to use.,1
Industrial Designer: Push button or a LCD.,1
"Marketing: Volume, they are use a lot.",0
Industrial Designer: but I have seem to forget them forgot them.,0
"Project Manager: I'm gonna do an opening, talk about did you all get the minutes? I emailed them to you.",1
Project Manager: No special colour.,1
"Project Manager: I personally think the LCD screen we wanna use, with the extra information, I think nobody has anything against it.",1
Industrial Designer: If we have a smaller a smaller device that actually fits into the big one.,1
Industrial Designer: It wo not get between the pillows on the couch.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, we can CC him on any discussions or documents that are passed around.",1
"Project Manager: No, not too small, yeah.",0
"Project Manager: Yeah, but do we have do we need extra buttons,",1
"Marketing: And, therefore use fresh colours.",1
Industrial Designer: It was in the email.,0
"Marketing: So as it is, not really doing either of them.",1
"Marketing: And if we devote some energy into this, I think the recent productions of Real Reaction, the I go everywhere power, the high definition DVD players although it makes immediate sense to have our remote control interact with these, I think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools.",1
"Industrial Designer: My name is Xavier Juergens, I'm the Industrial Designer, there are three main questions that I have to find an answer to today.",1
"Industrial Designer: Actually, does tha does special material mean that plastic is not a special material? 'Cause I think they can be plastic.",1
"Project Manager: Four? Easy to use, four.",0
Industrial Designer: it would be quite loud.,1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, it is not distance problem it it is recognising a person is voice,",0
"Industrial Designer: I do realise that we might be being fairly biased, 'cause it is our product,",1
"User Interface: I think it depends, I mean I think it is a good idea, but we need to really think about how useful it is gonna be because theoretically with the TV you already have a big display right in front of you.",1
"Industrial Designer: Easy to use, it is very relative but three it is fine, I think, it is reasonable three.",0
"Marketing: And then kind of lead us in the direction of deciding, what are our options, what should we decide, do you know what I mean, so.",1
Marketing: Can I just draw the face?,0
"User Interface: DVD players, things like that.",1
"Marketing: Well, we can as I.",0
"User Interface: But if we were to, if we were, that, the speech recognition.",1
"Industrial Designer: So, not the favourite animal, but I think I will draw elephant.",1
Project Manager: And the leaves plays the roles of antennas?,0
"Industrial Designer: first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made, what is it happens inside the casing, which is more your field.",1
"User Interface: well we have not really made any decisions about what we are gonna do about the cluster of button functions, colours, forms, in the in consistent use.",1
Industrial Designer: Because you have to.,0
Marketing: Not for such simple functions.,0
Marketing: Let is see.,0
"Industrial Designer: w Of course, first before designing the func well thinking about the functionalities, we need to know what are the user requirements.",1
"Marketing: I mean if we think of something, like I was saying also lime, lemon you know,",0
"Marketing: And when you are rotating, you will look behind, look this way it is possible to do with this, maybe there is a possibility of selling more than two million units in one year, which could you know, feasibili feasibility lower the price of the unit.",1
"User Interface: No we are not making a universal remote,",0
"Marketing: Very basic colours, like Janus explained.",0
Project Manager: So I will try to get my presentation running.,1
"User Interface: n Yeah, yeah tha that is why we have to do language adaptation.",0
Marketing: on the you can have it on the telly though.,0
"Project Manager: The user interface design, it is the same story.",1
"Project Manager: We introduced ourselves, discussed the possibility of a macro facility, interac interacting the TV a bit more, mentioning of barcode, joystick for user manipulation, ergonomics of the remote control as well.",1
"Project Manager: unfortunately the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons, it is gonna cost us fourteen point six Euros.",1
User Interface: I think we can do three.,1
Marketing: But what will make it what will make it interesting for people to buy though?,0
Marketing: It is the fat cat.,0
"Industrial Designer: But to give him the shape of your hand, so you it is easier to use or something lie that.",1
"User Interface: So s basically this deals with special users, children, handicapped people, old people, prog basically they are prograable, specially for children.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, we are going more for the trends than for the usability anyway, right?",0
Project Manager: Is there an a universal universal way of transmitting from the remote to the television so it is all about.,0
User Interface: So could call it settings or something.,0
"User Interface: using the standards, basic I think that we should stand out unique, being unique with the design.",1
"Project Manager: All you need to do is train them to the individual one, all you need to do is know the f like some fourdigit code.",1
Marketing: I think that is fair yeah.,0
Project Manager: I'm Abigail Claflin.,1
"Project Manager: So, yeah, it has to be original, trendy, userfriendly that is what we are going to design.",1
Marketing: The remote control has got a really trendy look.,1
"Project Manager: And they actually want a look, feel design, user interface design, you can look, see this as well as I can.",1
Project Manager: But you are going to get your instructions I think sended by the coach.,0
"User Interface: What did they say? I think the thing was that if you decide to do this, to have triangular buttons, somebody might look at this one, say well this triangular button is pointing up, that is the first thing that they see.",1
User Interface: cause perhaps you should choose what is most often used.,0
User Interface: The channels change one by one.,0
"Marketing: No, I just put them there to, yeah, for general idea.",0
User Interface: Yeah this in different colours?,0
"Marketing: sorry, just, just a screen, like a computer screen.",0
"User Interface: Think the design can pretty much carry over to everything, although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different.",1
"Industrial Designer: which can be buttons, whatever, which in fact controls a chip.",1
"Marketing: So we put this on top, then make the corporate logo.",1
"Industrial Designer: When the user presses a button, a signal got sent, goes to the LED, transmits tranmi transmits its to the TV.",1
"Project Manager: So, I think it is four.",1
Marketing: I will see if I can find them.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, you really need buttons for changing a channel.",1
Project Manager: And then I will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation.,1
"Project Manager: so regarding the automatic speech recognition, I think this is.",0
User Interface: But if you push the teletext button twice.,0
Industrial Designer: but you could change the way it looked.,0
"Project Manager: So With that concept I started thinking, so why not just steal Nokia is idea, just make changeable covers for your .",1
"Marketing: Numbers is ten, volume is twelve,",1
"User Interface: And, well basic operations like on, off, switching channels, maybe teletext or something like that.",0
"User Interface: so this is you know, a unique problem with televisions is that if you have this scro this scroll wheel for the television, the the tuner on the TV is not gonna be able to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll, so you know, the th the person might want to have a Might want to be able to scroll past television stations without seeing what is on them, in which case it just waits until you stop scrolling, then, you know, displays that station.",0
User Interface: So it is a two.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yes, I think it should be something like that.",1
"User Interface: Not just one,",1
"Project Manager: What is that? Yeah, that is correct.",0
"User Interface: No, it does not give any added value.",0
User Interface: so here is my presentation about technical function design.,1
"Industrial Designer: but we can also use it a bleep like something, when the battery is empty, then there is a bleep.",1
Industrial Designer: We have the uncurved or flat case.,1
Project Manager: You are not you are not obliged to share it.,0
"Marketing: The personal preferences for the young people, they liked fruity colours like banana yellow, strawberry red, stuff.",1
"Project Manager: And what else, we have.",0
User Interface: I mean it just seems like.,0
"Industrial Designer: Well, other case, we can make it singlecurved or uncurved.",1
Project Manager: I'd say we are doing well there.,0
"Marketing: So if it is part of the changeable covers then may maybe they can choose a different texture, a spongy one or a soft one or something like that.",1
Marketing: And others that are also available.,0
"Marketing: Yeah?, design is simple to use, simple in features.",1
User Interface: to make it more like a mobile phone.,1
"Marketing: So, I mean we could maybe put two again on them.",1
Industrial Designer: I feel totally at ease.,0
User Interface: Yeah wa you actually Yeah.,0
Industrial Designer: Buttons on top of it.,1
Marketing: It is not a remote control that makes the TV do one two.,0
"User Interface: an example of the function could be to change the vole up or down, so obviously you need two different buttons for that.",0
User Interface: The second is a fancy controller.,1
"Project Manager: So we have to take decisions about the component concepts, about the energy.",1
"Marketing: If somebody wants to buy it they can have it, otherwise no.",0
"Marketing: that has another element, which is if every time you are done using the remote you put it on a charger, then you then it has a place.",1
"User Interface: But, you know, they all sorta have the same role changing channels, volumes, then programming.",1
"Marketing: Yeah, then defines itself.",0
"Industrial Designer: Alrigh In fact, having them both will if we want to have battery, regular battery, the solar energy battery it could be it will it will add a little bit of the price,",1
"Industrial Designer: but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing,",1
"Project Manager: So, you know I mean, luckily we chose a nice simple shape.",1
Marketing: We got rid of the plastic.,0
Project Manager: do they want all those functions on that small.,0
"Project Manager: So Now, we have to make some concept.",0
"Project Manager: I follow the Master class for the SMARTboard, so I think that is the that is the main issue.",0
"Industrial Designer: But you can make a, yeah, you can make a trigger here.",0
"User Interface: but we were making like we sort of made different shapes, then discussed how the how the buttons might work,",0
Project Manager: No I d I think that is more in.,0
Project Manager: It needs to cost twelve Euros fifty to make.,1
"User Interface: Surprising to me is like people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones, like a real want to see a new launch or something like that.",1
"Marketing: I think we'd like to think the ideas were new,",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, the thing we saw.",0
"Marketing: Well I brought up some exactly, but I think you raised some good questions about are there enough of these people out there, or are they making purchasing decisions?",1
"Marketing: The noise for when you lose the banana, f yeah, for when you lose the remote control, it could be like a monkey noise or something like that, rather than a standard beep.",1
"Industrial Designer: They were like round curves, different.",0
"Marketing: That was twice as i important as the next item on here which is that it has to be technologically innovative has to have something else, apart from just the look of it.",0
User Interface: It is it means when you when you sell this controller in China it is can recognise Chinese.,0
"Project Manager: well, you wor yes, work on a design, keep it general, I mean so w we will be still fle flexible with maybe adding some functions.",1
Project Manager: And do we do we have a.,0
Project Manager: that is think about it la later on.,0
"User Interface: No, new requirements say no.",1
Marketing: Like in terms of holding it.,1
Project Manager: So that is not much to save either.,0
"User Interface: having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones, what functions we actually need, then how to group, arrange these on the actual the actual plastic or rubber handheld piece.",1
"Marketing: cutting edge technology, I do not think we are gonna have that, these were ideas I was putting together, unless we come up with some New Age product a as far as the casing is concerned.",0
"Project Manager: Be we want to be distinguished,? People want to when they look at the shelf want to think, well that is the product I need.",1
Marketing: like for your mobile phone.,0
"Marketing: If we if we are working to head office specifications as this is what this project team is working for, we can put in our recommendations for what we have found, what we the consensus that we have come to as a result of the meetings.",1
"Marketing: Well it got it it has got to fit into the shape, of course.",0
"Project Manager: Sarah, I'm sorry if I misspelled your name, I did not know whether it was SARA or SARH.",0
Industrial Designer: I suspect they are very fixed to a particular need.,0
"Marketing: Yeah, but it looks good.",0
"Marketing: The trends from the past years, what the people like, what the youngsters like, what the elderly people liked about shapes, colours, material, stuff.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, what was on the.",0
"Industrial Designer: I'm Krista, I'm the Industrial Designer.",1
Industrial Designer: so on the cover we have the bare essentials.,0
"Marketing: Thus it might be might be smart to make a big zapping button or something in the middle, so you can reach it with your thumb.",1
"Marketing: Ah, that is why it wo not meet.",0
"Marketing: Yeah, these are new ideas, like glowinthedark or something like that.",1
"Marketing: So, I got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well, at the end.",1
"Marketing: Because, the other thing, I did not tell you all my presentation, is that people find it find that it is a big waste of time to have to learn how to use your remote.",0
"Marketing: Well, the prototype is very well within the design, ideas that we have talked about on the previous meetings.",0
User Interface: So the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside.,1
Industrial Designer: here we have a tiger.,1
Project Manager: Probably case material.,0
"Project Manager: Warning, finish meeting now.",1
"Marketing: In material yeah rubber, rubber is, like I said, young people like more soft materials, spongy ones.",1
"Marketing: I think for gaming, you know you want you want some big buttons for up, down, left, right, shoot.",1
Marketing: Do we have ki some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has these basic elements?,0
Marketing: A new remote control for TV.,0
Industrial Designer: I will give a five.,0
"Project Manager: I have forgotten to mail you the minutes, but I will do.",1
"Project Manager: We are entering a new market here,",0
"User Interface: One for like cost, the one with like higherend.",0
Project Manager: Here are some functions.,1
Project Manager: So to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing.,1
Project Manager: And after that I have some new product requirements.,1
"User Interface: Actually of the of all these I personally p prefer this one, because it is the smallest, with least with the smallest number of buttons as well.",1
"User Interface: You say you say record to the to the speech recognition,",1
"User Interface: without titanium alloy, it is going to be light.",0
"Project Manager: Maybe, I do not know, some lights, a big but well.",1
"Industrial Designer: But if we decide to go on a n LCD screen, we would use an we have to use an a advanced chip set.",0
"Marketing: Als might be you just forgot the channel name, you kno only know the number.",1
"Project Manager: means, of having whiteboard, the digital pens, all that kind of good things.",1
"Industrial Designer: Well, we wanna make a multifunctional remote, right?",1
"User Interface: It has scroll wheels without a display, but they scroll like a computer mouse.",0
Project Manager: And that we have a shared network where we can put all of the.,0
User Interface: Yeah but then it is always more than one thing to do.,0
"Project Manager: I guess our, I guess our main main thing that we should focus on until then is probably deciding on a certain look, you know.",0
Marketing: But we need to find cost.,1
"Project Manager: Or, so then the real production we will start once we product evaluation, then it is approve from the technical team, your team, from the management, then we can launch in the market.",1
"Project Manager: In different languages, you know.",1
Industrial Designer: So that is pretty much it for the working design.,0
"User Interface: I think it is, fashion into electronics.",1
"Marketing: So this is even more than the than the cost you gave, the sixteen Euros.",1
"Project Manager: No? It is not that it is not the most important function,",0
"Industrial Designer: b but a b a pushbutton requires a simple chip underneath it, but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range.",1
Project Manager: Now let is talk about interface.,0
"User Interface: if we use the LEDs, i does it use much more energy or.",1
"Industrial Designer: it is generally the case that senior, wealthy people above forty five years old like, as you said, particularly the traditional materials as such as wood, materials such as that.",0
"User Interface: So I just look at some current designs on the web, of usually more complicated remote controls.",1
"Industrial Designer: So do you reckon that is a good idea that, where is the remote, I'm here thing? I think that would be quite fun.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, that is right.",0
Project Manager: And with a special colour.,1
"User Interface: For instance, let is say, or you know you pr you press say the play button for the DVD player, it turns the TV on, onto the right channel as well,",0
"Project Manager: Yeah, we have to either that or make it integrated with a with a docking station.",1
"Project Manager: and there is I do not know exactly how many channels there are on when you take into account Sky, various other various others.",0
Industrial Designer: Flat on the top.,1
"Marketing: you could make like a hole in it, you know, of in the.",1
"Marketing: Well, it just depends on if we are gonna add a o on this pr provisionary cost analysis, we do not have a LC display.",1
Industrial Designer: Can we make that for h twenty cents?,0
Industrial Designer: I rate that pretty highly.,1
Industrial Designer: It gots conductive disks for every button.,1
"User Interface: Always have s the soft buttons, always clear the paint on it.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, it is when we come back in thirty minutes, you will have a prototype ready.",0
"Marketing: But I mean the thing with this whole if y you are planning on making it out of rubber, on the basis that it is spongy, then I'm not sure how well a scrolling wheel would work.",1
Marketing: Well something that does not.,0
User Interface: because the same customer will come back to buy other addons.,1
Industrial Designer: Simple to use or simple in design? Do you know?,0
"Industrial Designer: Or say let is lose rubber, take plastic.",0
User Interface: And even something that is held like that might be difficult.,0
"User Interface: So, then I had a look at new products that are on the market.",1
"User Interface: I personally would look at things like having a u universal remote, is is a good idea, like instead of having unusual ones for all of them you can think of having, with multiple functionality possibly with speech recognition.",1
"User Interface: so you pick your menu, then your different options, when you click on each one, it you can go into a new menu for that.",1
"Marketing: Yeah, that is gonna be the trick.",0
Industrial Designer: So we can go to production.,1
Project Manager: So I'm wondering if we if we neely really need all of those buttons.,1
"Marketing: It is called the Real Remote, right?",1
Marketing: So that is no option.,0
Project Manager: And we have the removable front cases.,1
Project Manager: I will give it a one.,0
Project Manager: And that is the only way I remember that I need to go other that point.,0
User Interface: and there is all the all the special buttons.,0
"Project Manager: I think we have had a bit of discussion already on this thing, n s there any other questions comments that came up in these presentations?",0
Industrial Designer: so maybe we should just stick to that unless we get told otherwise.,1
Marketing: The remote control is designed for people with age below forty.,1
Project Manager: And then we have to interface push buttons.,1
"Industrial Designer: And it'd be a small vocabulary speech recognition system,",0
User Interface: Ah it is.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, if we are if we are talking twenty five Euros as a price, that is not unaffordable, even for young people.",1
User Interface: Well it is just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, the that would not be the remote so much,",0
Project Manager: tha that should be relatively simple.,1
"User Interface: Yeah, this is microphone array, in fact.",0
"Project Manager: the means for like the materials we used, how convenient were they? Like the pens, the whiteboard,",0
Project Manager: So it is like holding.,0
Industrial Designer: I think our responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager.,1
Industrial Designer: Cause you also have to know which way around to point this thing.,0
Project Manager: just give it a two.,1
"Industrial Designer: Fact, I dunno if you noticed, but I wrote the the company is name on the telephone screen,",1
Marketing: It is alright.,0
"Project Manager: And you know, th the design that I have got, it could be a homemade design, you know this says this not just a television remote control, this, you know, a fashion accessory.",1
"User Interface: that would be any number of different things such as switch on the television, switch to the next channel, that sort of thing, I think we are all quite quite intelligent, know what a normal remote control does.",1
"Marketing: I'm not sure, new ideas found.",0
"Marketing: I think we should definitely go with buttons that do not look like a normal remote, 'cause most remotes have small square buttons,",0
"Industrial Designer: Three, it is.",0
"Marketing: and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons, which just confuse them.",1
Marketing: First of all I think this is not functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons.,1
Project Manager: But you will be informed via the computer.,1
"Industrial Designer: and the th red sorry the green one is to well, putting things together, f transform the data into qu into the format to to communicate with the TV set.",1
"Project Manager: we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification, what needs, desires are to be fulfilled, the functions design, what effects the apparatus should have, the working design, how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function.",1
"Project Manager: And we have to use the pen, the eraser.",0
"Project Manager: do we think these ideas an, my sp speech recognition, I mean maybe it is possible for twelve Euro but then it will be at cost of other functionality we might implement like the the furry case of the.",0
"Industrial Designer: But, this is like a remote control for children.",0
Marketing: But it is just a TV remote.,1
Marketing: And in the end we calculate an average.,1
"Marketing: How many should we sell then?, a lot,",0
"Project Manager: Well, look at the costs at this point.",1
Marketing: Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user.,1
"Project Manager: Do we include it, do we give it a prominent prominent place on the on well h on the remote mot control itself.",1
"User Interface: And well, it all by pushing a button on the remote.",1
Project Manager: Most of the time you have the yeah it is a sleeping remote control.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah w what about a yellow thing, I mean it.",1
User Interface: What where is it gonna sit in your living room? Is it not gonna fall off the arm of the sofa?,0
Industrial Designer: Like peeling of the banana you s.,1
"Project Manager: This is the presentation boards, wh which one I'm using right now.",1
Marketing: I have never attached to anything.,0
User Interface: And this child interface has minimum buttons.,0
Industrial Designer: And the teletext button.,0
"User Interface: I agree, but I think it is very important that they always make the same buttons accessible, so use just for special options a part of the touch screen.",1
Marketing: we have the buttons is are not that much.,0
Project Manager: We want something that you can find easily.,1
"Industrial Designer: the flat co completely flat case is definitely out, right? It has to be at least curved from one side, yeah.",1
"Marketing: It will just be criteria one, two, three, four, five, six, or A, B, C, D, E, F to confuse it with the number rating.",1
User Interface: And this is.,0
"Marketing: So maybe one of the things we can just try, include is a really good battery.",0
"Project Manager: so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maxim twelve, a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target.",0
Marketing: We will have to simply we will have to work on it together.,0
"Industrial Designer: So I think maybe two batteries, I dunno what they are called six, or something like that.",1
"Marketing: This is what we know from the last from the questionnaires from the all the p surveys we have done, fancy, feelgood, that is what we have been looking for, something that feels good in the hand, that is easy to use.",1
Industrial Designer: I will put it back in a minute.,0
"User Interface: No, these the front buttons which are here, are the mute buttons.",0
Project Manager: we wanted special colours did not we?,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, but I think I think two.",0
"Industrial Designer: And because, obviously, all TVs use this, the same infrared medi, we'd just be using the same thing to transmit the data.",1
"Marketing: also they did some questions on voice recognition, found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age, so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition, whereas the older people in the like sixty, above segment or so did not really think that they would pay more money for voice recognitions.",1
"Project Manager: The tool training is to try out the white board, so.",1
"Marketing: I probably get instruction on that, how to do that,",0
"Industrial Designer: We can either go for a really cheap model, keep all of the costs down, which means a flat plastic case with an ordinary battery, simple push buttons.",1
Marketing: but the rest of them like went in.,0
"Marketing: But I think that, even if it is very subtle, we need to kind of trick our consers, so they at least get the idea that they are getting something that is new, modern, sleek, Whether it is through the shape or the colours or all of that.",1
Project Manager: There is a toolbar over here.,1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, n Not that weird, because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy, to attract a young public.",1
"Marketing: Ah no, we have to do all those hours again.",0
"Industrial Designer: But you know our targets are very high, means fifty million Euros is the profit which we want make.",1
"Project Manager: We have functional design, conceptual design, detail design.",1
"User Interface: Well, we will have this on the screen, on the display.",1
"Marketing: you have it is on some phones too, which have a docking station.",1
User Interface: It just gives you a it just gives you a verbal response.,1
"User Interface: And the paging function works well,",0
Project Manager: Are we out of time?,0
"User Interface: Yeah, but it I think it should be quite cheap because it is from our own company, yeah.",0
Industrial Designer: It might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape.,1
"Industrial Designer: that is why I think the option of the kinetic thing which basically means as long as you shake it like a watch, like an automatic watch.",0
"Industrial Designer: even automatic on off is also a bit problematic, because it different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really they just they do not touch the remote, y you do not know how much time you need to switch on or switch off.",1
"Project Manager: But, where did it Where did you find that?",0
Project Manager: and we have a nearly final product.,1
"Marketing: Is it possible that when we open our fliptop shell it is a little compact mirror, when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th the remote control display thing.",1
"Marketing: I wanna make this thing something that I can identify as special in some way, so maybe we can have some I talked about environmentally sensitive, maybe we have a product that can be identified in some way as advantageous in a home.",0
User Interface: We got these buttons here.,1
Project Manager: Lovely to see you all again.,0
"Project Manager: The method that we are going to use to complete the project, that has three components as such.",1
"Project Manager: do you have to write down why that does not matter, just it is to get used to the whiteboard, but it is.",0
User Interface: but it did not work quite the well the way I wanted it to do.,0
Marketing: That is right.,0
"User Interface: I mean, these are three examples sort of looking at it.",0
"Marketing: But what we what we need is something that looks like it is from the future that looks cool, that is different, you know, that is everyone has a white remote control, black remote control, you need something cool.",0
"User Interface: They can put the basic buttons, one, two, three, four.",1
"Industrial Designer: A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface, because it is just rubber, so it is probably a flat surface rubber.",1
Project Manager: so mayb better if you have all this in the same.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, so that has implications though for the.",1
"Project Manager: And then I'm gonna turn over to you guys to make brief presentations on what you have found, then we will have a bit of discussion.",0
Project Manager: But at the same time userfriendly.,0
"User Interface: so that is my recommendation, if you use many options in one buttle button, display the menu on the TV.",1
"Project Manager: I ki I kind of like your idea about the retro phone dial,",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, it is fancy, according to me.",1
User Interface: You can see they are very different.,1
"User Interface: If you then have a sort of outer skin of flexible, spongy rubber then you have something that is you know very much you know organic, I think would look rather co I mean mi rather cool.",1
Project Manager: You can display pr two presentations if you want to.,0
Project Manager: One point five of a Euro for one push button does not sound quite right.,0
Marketing: I'm wondering what will the voice recognition mean for the production price?,0
"Marketing: So are we basically back to the original one now, back to the first version? Which turns out to be on budget exactly, pretty much.",1
"Marketing: Yeah, if the costs al allow it.",1
User Interface: Yeah but people do not like it when their buttons are all over the place.,0
"Marketing: And, you know, ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control.",1
User Interface: this was our first concept.,1
"Marketing: Well, we definitely need those.",1
User Interface: I opened the CD ROM box guys.,0
Marketing: the remote control looks fancy.,1
Project Manager: something that we can easily be adopted at the last minute as well I'd say.,0
User Interface: We have you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy.,1
"Marketing: And so personally I think that we need a modern eyecatching design, but it really needs to be simple.",0
Project Manager: well I have seen it done before.,0
"Project Manager: from all three of your presentations, I think that we were on the right track a lot in our last meeting.",1
"Project Manager: gentlemen, just a reminder, we d we have five minutes left for this meeting.",1
"Project Manager: And that is a pity,",0
"User Interface: So we have the two options we can follow, either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber, depending on cost restraints.",1
"Marketing: Course, maybe they had not thought of this whole touch screen option, but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have the technology, we are not gonna use it even though we know it will sell is a call I do not think I can give the highs ups.",0
Marketing: Is that correct on my slide?,0
Project Manager: Your thing is in where is it? Is it in.,0
Marketing: I do not know really how it works.,0
"Project Manager: Well but because you say they their features are important, they want m a lot,",0
Project Manager: The price of selling is twenty five Euros.,1
User Interface: If it is only for televi.,0
Marketing: depends on what you implement in the speech feat.,0
Marketing: Yeah that is fins.,0
"Industrial Designer: So you finding, just to say that the chip can detect when a key is pressed, then it translate to the key, to a sequence, something like morse code, as you know, with a different sequence for each key,",1
User Interface: You just tell the television I want which channel.,1
Industrial Designer: Alt function F eight.,0
Industrial Designer: How does the apparatus work? And well I basically had two points.,1
"Industrial Designer: so i it is not really worth to get to have the image if you do not look at, so.",0
Marketing: For up down left right.,1
Project Manager: It is come in under budget.,0
"Industrial Designer: Maybe it a good feature, since it takes if it is around the TFT then it is good, because it is just keeps it safe,",1
"Project Manager: That should be there, minutes.",0
"Project Manager: It does not have to be really big, but just have to be has to be there.",0
"Industrial Designer: They can be basically the shape of the cases, they can be flat, they can be curved with onesided curved, one side flat,",1
"User Interface: so if you wanna switch to the to u do you have to switch to a function where like y so you are either in that mode or you are in the mode where like it just has like the four like you know this is channel that way, that is that way, volume is up, down.",0
"Industrial Designer: And working on the inside we have already said d decided on the kinetic batteries, which actually, thinking about it now, could y could also probably attach to the flipping open, shut as well, so that you could probably get a bit of.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards, but if you have some more notes on that.",0
"User Interface: Yeah, they could be plastic.",1
Project Manager: We just we just skip the voca or was it the speech recognition.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, it was hardly ever used really.",0
Project Manager: Like an iPod or something?,0
Marketing: I would greatly advise not to do it.,1
Marketing: That is what the report says yeah.,0
Industrial Designer: Though it was our specification.,0
"Project Manager: So, the average is about a two.",0
User Interface: We got a couple innovative i.,0
User Interface: A voice recognition can be implemented.,0
"Marketing: Well when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis, although I'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions, they should be secondary, at least if not functionally then visually, like those should not be.",1
"Marketing: There is some remote controls where there is kind of a hidden panel, so all those buttons that you do not really use unless you are programming or something.",0
Project Manager: We have only got a couple of minutes.,0
Marketing: I think we have to go for the first one.,0
"Industrial Designer: And you have to think how we are gonna put the screen in it, those kind of things.",0
"Marketing: And just be able to s use them all from the same remote, but not at the same time.",1
"Industrial Designer: A automatically, lights up at first touch.",0
"User Interface: looking at the interface concept, it is gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this.",1
"Industrial Designer: Y i I think we will have to choose between the docking station or the screen, 'cause.",0
"User Interface: Today we have teletext, all those things.",0
Project Manager: W what You want it big do you want it small.,0
"Project Manager: case material is rubber, it is a special colour,",0
"Marketing: Yeah, screen settings, audio settings, teletext settings you have.",0
"Industrial Designer: we also can choose what materials, the we could use metal, we could use rubber which might be more ideal for the antiRSI.",1
"Project Manager: It has to be original, trendy, user friendly.",1
Project Manager: So we are gonna each of you gonna give us a litt a little presentation.,0
"User Interface: Either refresh it, or it sh.",0
"Industrial Designer: but the button itself, the blue can be anything else.",0
"Marketing: At the end of the day, th the engineering design is one thing, it is the user interface design that may th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world.",0
"Industrial Designer: On off, that is a possibility, yeah.",0
Marketing: So the cost for these were.,0
"Marketing: well d you do an average at the end, I do not know.",1
"Marketing: Regarding the first line, what So we are just expecting no more use of the teletext.",1
Marketing: It is compared to the all.,0
Industrial Designer: But the but but the.,0
Marketing: So we are gonna turn that around.,0
Industrial Designer: But it is a very expensive material.,0
Industrial Designer: I in the file option menu.,1
Marketing: But definitely not well I do not know.,0
"Marketing: and that, they say that is used zero point eight times an hour, which is actually somewhat high.",0
Project Manager: I think that we should incorporate that.,1
"User Interface: I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons, but if you have other proposals.",1
"Industrial Designer: hand dynamos are definitely out, right? You got a wind dynamo, yeah.",1
"Marketing: I'm about to end, yeah.",1
"User Interface: And if you w you push p children, you do not have to log in, but you can only watch children is channels or.",0
"Marketing: So maybe next to each of the buttons, you know each of them could have a number, then also a function written next to it, so you are basically pressing.",0
"User Interface: And I think if we wanna keep our costs down, we should just go for pushbuttons, 'cause then we can have a simple chip, it is simpler, it is cheaper to make pushbuttons than it is a scroll button.",1
Project Manager: that is what I something I have to look into.,1
"User Interface: Well, if it could be done, we.",1
Industrial Designer: However of course this would be like designing two remotes pretty much.,0
Marketing: how much is left in the battery.,1
Industrial Designer: We do not have any push buttons.,0
"Marketing: I have some a method, a requirements, scale of.",0
"Project Manager: but like we said before, it has to be used on every television.",1
Industrial Designer: just the decision of the power button.,0
Industrial Designer: It was really good yeah.,1
User Interface: I think we should This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment.,1
"Marketing: the challenge is that current trends right now, across the board in fashion, in furniture, in technology, is a very organic fruit, vegetable kind of thing.",1
Industrial Designer: That is the most import.,0
"Project Manager: at the last minute, I'm sorry about that,",1
Project Manager: so I think we have probably got about that time before we come back.,0
Project Manager: Welcome to the meeting everyone.,1
Industrial Designer: I would draw it like this.,0
"Marketing: Yeah, j ju yeah, v voting application.",0
"Industrial Designer: Like we can have a ma material such as plastic, rubber, wood, titani, but titani we ca not use.",1
Industrial Designer: and I think the fact that we are wearing these things restricts.,0
"Marketing: So first they had people they ranked the important aspects of r remote controls, right now i d they are saying that currently there is a functional look, feel preference, but that really, over the next year it that is gonna be switching to fancy look, feel remotes, so that just goes back to the whole desire of our c Real Reaction company wanting to focus on fashion, so, even though we are stressing, when we are talking, we have all been talking about this like simplicity, easy to use idea, they are sort of wanting us to remember that the nber one thing for everyone is that it is fancy look, feel.",1
Project Manager: An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button.,1
User Interface: And some sort of it will either have a lock button like we mentioned or a cover or something like that.,0
Project Manager: The pen? No.,0
"Marketing: I'm just kind of pushing at that to see if you came out with anything else, but I mean I totally agree.",0
User Interface: So what should I draw?,0
"Industrial Designer: But if we choose for that option, the docking station would c become obsolete.",1
"Marketing: If it should be done, if it could be done, I wo not matter.",1
Industrial Designer: But I think these ten buttons look a bit dull.,0
"User Interface: And so you have that one piece that stays, the rest just sort of clips in.",0
"Industrial Designer: Of course it is very handy if the remote control is hand held, so you do not have to wind it up or something, or just is it is very light to to make to use it.",1
Industrial Designer: Yeah I was thinking just common AA cells.,0
"Marketing: menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition, settings, things that you are not gonna use every day, that a lot of people are not gonna use but it is an option there for this hitech market that sort of re is the sleek thing we are going for.",1
"Project Manager: but you can also make a wood colour, not just one single colour but a woodlike thing,",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, but it has to be intuitive.",1
"Marketing: first of all it is the biggest share, the biggest audience, sixty five percent.",1
Marketing: So like the interface is really important.,1
"Project Manager: Well, we p we can do it glow in the dark.",1
Industrial Designer: So that is out of the question.,0
User Interface: Yeah two yeah.,1
"User Interface: Generally, all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance.",1
"Project Manager: So in that case we could use kinetic energy, but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good.",1
"Industrial Designer: from, on a functional side of things, we found out that wh from our previous meeting, we decided that there are certain points that will make our product unique.",1
Project Manager: then the corporate identity should be in the product.,0
"Project Manager: let is see, the last meeting we went over who was responsible for what.",0
Industrial Designer: But depends on what we want.,1
"User Interface: Yeah, but that is the that is the basic idea of the speaker.",0
"Project Manager: There it could have a stem like that, 'cause I do l kind of like the stem.",1
"User Interface: New ideas about the working of this software, about the project, about the remote controls or.",1
"Project Manager: And that has to do with the camera settings, so we do not have our laptops in front of the cameras.",1
"User Interface: And then the last thing is just that it will be black labelling on top, just which we did not do.",0
"User Interface: But you should be careful,",1
Project Manager: I think we have to keep that.,0
"Project Manager: no more questions, we can close the session.",0
User Interface: Well basi basically the for f for I mean e each manufacturer will have a partic will have a particular command set that the TV responds to.,0
"User Interface: So if there is a g a way of finding it quite easily, I thought that'd be quite good quite a good feature.",1
"Project Manager: Right, so we need one fifty off.",1
Industrial Designer: It is fine.,0
"Project Manager: because I re but I really do not understand that, because I can imagine a remote control with far more pushbuttons, it would not be possible according to this sheet.",1
User Interface: The user does not have an advantage really.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, I was thinking you can.",0
"Industrial Designer: The rest of the components they do have an impact in terms of cost, complexity.",0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, it probably would be universal.",1
"Project Manager: yeah, I have to say something.",0
"Project Manager: There we go, there we go.",0
"Marketing: what needs, desires are to be fulfilled? So there are a few means to reach that by doing research to see what existing products are there out in the market.",0
Marketing: So we are just gonna talk a little bit about the functional requirements that people specified when they were asked.,0
Industrial Designer: they because for want of a.,0
"Industrial Designer: A four also, because, except for the wheel, we do not have so much innovation.",1
Project Manager: I thought it was the other way round.,0
Marketing: And eighty percent of the people they are always l I mean they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy.,1
"User Interface: for example if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons, or you will have LCD display which is that is going to bring the cost by two Euros at least.",1
"Project Manager: But probably quick, simple is primary rather than added extras.",0
"Marketing: An eagle, again I'm thinking on my feet goodness.",0
"Project Manager: Speech recognition, I think it is very hard, because we are selling across multiple countries.",0
"Project Manager: Apparently, we have to choose one or the other.",1
Industrial Designer: There is nothing more to it.,0
Marketing: maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor you would also see there.,0
Project Manager: We ca not lose the double curve.,0
"Industrial Designer: No, well no 'cause you would not have to you do not actually have to press them you just.",0
Project Manager: T I I'm curious about what the debriefing is gonna be like.,0
"Industrial Designer: And we can also incorporate an LCD display in the remote, but this will increase the cost.",1
Marketing: And then we can move on to the more advanced features.,1
"User Interface: Yeah, maybe that is good idea, yeah.",0
"Marketing: And young people were quite receptive to this, but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty age forty five age group, older, people were not quite so keen on speech recognition.",1
"Project Manager: And we will yeah tha let is provisionally let is go for a touch screen one with several submenus for possible extra stuff that one basically put the channel, the on, off switch on the touch screen.",1
Project Manager: so we have got the working design for ID.,0
"Industrial Designer: the various functions used for changing channel, channel up, down, vole, things like that.",1
Project Manager: And in your remote control.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah even we can change colours, no? Like the.",1
"Industrial Designer: Hum, you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons, so you have got the volume in orange on design there,",1
Project Manager: well this is the the closing already.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, i if it would be faster, it would be great.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, so I think we can reasonably say it is another one,",0
"Project Manager: Yeah, because all things are stored in smart board dot XDK.",0
"Industrial Designer: And I'm gonna use the whiteboard, just 'cause we have not used it.",1
Project Manager: Case materi s supplements.,0
Marketing: This is fine for making a presentat for project presentations.,1
Project Manager: And the RR.,0
"Project Manager: Fit in your hand, yeah.",1
"Industrial Designer: We have the option of the speaker as well the sa the same thing goes for the speaker, is there a need for the remote control to talk back?",0
"Industrial Designer: You need a docking cradle, for example, for you to put it in to charge.",1
Industrial Designer: I will give it a one.,1
Project Manager: So we have.,0
Industrial Designer: Each of us is going.,1
Project Manager: We will see later.,0
Marketing: Yeah that should be possible too.,0
Marketing: to start with these points.,0
"Industrial Designer: in there we have technical functions presentation, working design presentation, the functional requirements.",1
"Project Manager: And we have maybe we have to we say, only for TV, not teletext?",1
Project Manager: I'm not sure.,1
User Interface: And I can change the colour of it.,0
"Project Manager: Energy, chip on print.",1
Marketing: the main reason is they are pretty.,0
"Project Manager: Another thing that might affect other decisions is that the management feels that teletext is outdated, because more people are using the internet now.",1
Industrial Designer: It it will be fashion.,0
"Industrial Designer: So this can be simple kind of programmable chip, which can use microphone sensors.",1
Project Manager: So we know for definite we know we have now got some definite things going on.,0
Project Manager: Well we wo not.,0
"Project Manager: So, we are m we are meant to comment on leadership, the means, E G whiteboard, digital pens, et cetera.",1
Project Manager: Then he can maybe find out to get his cord right.,0
"Marketing: yeah i it is again in this what I said first it has to be fancy so I think if nobody else pro provides currently a remote control with that kind of stuff, if we can provide it I think it is a good sell for us.",1
"Project Manager: So, we are going to have a meeting about the functional design.",1
"Project Manager: y you know, you could just go so far with it,",0
User Interface: Like as an optional thing.,0
Marketing: We also have to compare it to the to the remote controls on the market nowadays.,1
"Marketing: that was in the test, the most people f find it irritating when they cannot find a rem their remote control,",1
"Marketing: It is like man, we ca not have the locator thing.",0
Project Manager: I think that is a pretty good guess though.,0
Industrial Designer: So this is going to be about the component design.,1
Project Manager: That could always be.,0
Marketing: because there are problems with a voice command.,1
"User Interface: So I think it it does not make sense to have both like a scrolling, spinning thing,",1
Marketing: because for the marketing point you have to see what the consumers want.,1
"Industrial Designer: Concerning the interface we can we can put just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons much more complicated, but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so.",1
Marketing: Certainly by the next meeting.,1
"Industrial Designer: And personal preferences, besides the fact that I ca not spell, we need a longlasting energy source, people do not wanna be changing it a lot.",1
"Project Manager: Or make it on a hand dynamo, but I do not think that will work.",1
Project Manager: I am worried about like using a menu.,0
Industrial Designer: I'm dealing with the components design.,1
"Marketing: So, we have all got a note of it is thirteen point seven, is not it, with everything we want on.",1
User Interface: it needs some some yellow format.,0
"User Interface: I mean what other options would you have? A little screen or something, but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user.",0
Industrial Designer: Let is make it black.,0
"Project Manager: It is a bit slow you can see, this is a bit annoying.",1
"Project Manager: Cause yeah, that gives you a seven, which ruins your average.",1
"Industrial Designer: that was it, that was it.",0
"Project Manager: we hurry up a bit, because otherwise we wo not make it.",0
Project Manager: But you will have to make consensus with.,0
"Industrial Designer: maybe, I do not know.",0
Marketing: What else can you do with a television?,0
"Project Manager: If it is, for example, a trainable one then we are just simply having like an up, down, left, right, an button or something like that might do as well in future proofing it.",1
Project Manager: I am the project manager for today.,1
"Project Manager: it is very easy to use, but the second layer is not easy to use.",0
Marketing: I think we have a good thing.,0
"User Interface: I'm just trying to point out that I think that your evaluation, redesign turnaround time is too short well you have no redesign not you personally, but in the project we have no redesign time,",1
Marketing: Yeah but it has it has to fit your hand.,0
Industrial Designer: Are you gonna do that?,0
Marketing: Kick it out.,1
"Marketing: So I guess what I'd like from a universal remote is maybe choosing between three devices, being able to switch between them, there may be stereo, VCR, TV.",1
User Interface: Make it a bigger dial.,0
"Industrial Designer: So maybe if we got rid of like the maybe one of the special colours, kept them all the same colour, then we could have the voice recognition.",1
"Project Manager: Then I need to say some st a few things about finance, 'cause we have to check that it is within the finance criteria.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, you can watch a TV in the dark then.",0
"User Interface: Yeah, well you see, each made one, we did not have enough yellow dough.",1
"Marketing: But, I mean they are hidden in the screen.",0
"User Interface: see if we are technologically innovative, I'd say it is quite innovative, because there are not really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons.",1
"User Interface: And then just have the simple sort of handheld thing that we sort of devised earlier, as the actual remote.",1
Project Manager: But then again who wants to turn on a remote control.,1
"Project Manager: The finance, it is from my side, from the management, production evaluation.",0
Project Manager: but now for the minutes of the first meeting.,1
Industrial Designer: They are good at golf.,0
"Project Manager: Roo, could you do the same please? But a different animal with a different colour, a different line width.",0
User Interface: and then people would always know where it was.,0
Industrial Designer: we have assembled our prototype.,1
Marketing: yeah so something to sit on for now.,0
"Industrial Designer: the user interface is critical here, because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls that converts the electrical energy into data, which then goes through the infrared, so the chip that I think Ian is designing, is gonna be crucial.",1
"Project Manager: Yes, so what I prefer maybe you need to interact more with the Christine, because you know what she is going to do it, you know how to sell it.",1
"Marketing: And I have certainly felt heard, listened to in that in relevant areas we have been able to, you know, give, take, adjust our remit where necessary.",0
Industrial Designer: Because I was short on time.,1
Project Manager: I counted two batteries.,1
"Marketing: Yeah, because I mean if even looking at cellphones right now, those trends the smaller the hotter it is,",0
"Project Manager: Yeah, but it will it will it will be cause a lot of problems.",1
"Project Manager: the user interface design, so this is where the trendy stuff comes in.",1
"Industrial Designer: Ye yeah, 'cause I have definitely picked up remotes, like meant to change the channel, turn the volume, or vice versa,",1
"User Interface: this the voice, there is a voice recognition remote control, which can control mus multiple devices.",1
"Marketing: So it is w if we have if we have put in for another special form on a button, then maybe they could be a different shape.",1
User Interface: In fact I would propose another solution.,1
Project Manager: So just try to remember these points.,1
"Industrial Designer: But we do use an LCD screen, so we we do have to consider of we have to use a more advanced chip, which is more complex, expensive.",1
"Project Manager: Yes, but ab about the spec the buttons, the buttons that will be on it.",0
"Project Manager: Which, which may be cheaper than speech recognition if it were just a.",0
Industrial Designer: that is also a great advantage because you ca not lose it anymore.,0
User Interface: Maybe a Spanish name would work well.,0
User Interface: Technical functions design.,1
Industrial Designer: And maybe you bring the buttons nearer to the or the imp more important buttons nearer to the to the side.,1
"Marketing: I think that was my last slide, yeah.",0
Marketing: So push button then it is the next expensive one.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, just we have to design the inside then, but it should be.",0
"User Interface: This is not the final design,",0
"Industrial Designer: lots of considerations for the case, like what sort of shape it would be, curved or flat.",1
Project Manager: So I would say at least two.,0
Marketing: And I can start if you want.,0
"Project Manager: we each have a specific task, as I saw in my mail.",1
Project Manager: so I think that is quite a flexible thing.,0
"User Interface: And it should have an it can have an alarm clock a person if some if somebody wants to get up at around eight PM then he can set the time, it can be used as an alarm clock,",0
"Marketing: Well the problem was, even when we just were creating from the Excel file, there was not like a option to select to somehow have it included,",0
User Interface: It is not the easiest I have got to.,0
User Interface: If it w What if we completely took out the one single button we have got on.,0
Project Manager: the minutes from the last time.,1
"Project Manager: So we have like channel button, the previous channel button, the volume button, plus a mute button, just the traditional on off button.",0
Project Manager: So I think s two is better.,1
Project Manager: Something that looks mayb you know.,0
User Interface: Or we will get the email.,0
Project Manager: You can easily find the button in the dark or so?,0
"Marketing: Alright, let is keep it central.",0
"Project Manager: Then it would not, it probably would not be able to use It would be able to use the same reception on the remote c control I guess, but the actual device would have to have its own infrared signaller.",1
"User Interface: and now you can, for example, as I was if you make them big, it may change the look of the thing also to the people.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, we are to go for li, now I think we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries.",0
Project Manager: And less buttons than this is not possible.,0
Project Manager: That that is a good point.,0
"User Interface: because most channels are you know two digit nbers, you have to press you know a special button to enter a twodigit nber, then two nbers, so that is just it is annoying.",0
Marketing: Maybe you could ask your the you could ask the engineering department if we can.,0
"Industrial Designer: So the components I quickly draw here, is that in this part you have the remote control the sender, on the other part the receiver so that is my method is will be to well my aim would be to design the, choose the chips, the infrared components to build the remote control.",1
"Industrial Designer: I mean, I think it is just sort of the there is a lot of slide buttons out there.",0
"Project Manager: So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo, slogan running up one side of it kind of thing.",0
"Marketing: And then back to the one I was before,",1
"Industrial Designer: and the feedback can come through television itself, so do we need an LCD on the remote?",1
Industrial Designer: So it operates on your wrist kinda.,0
Project Manager: It just was in there.,0
"Project Manager: right our agenda for today, do you want us to give you a second?",1
"Project Manager: Well, teletext goes out.",1
Marketing: The other one.,0
"Project Manager: it is not that is not streamlined, sexy, having a having a wind up.",1
Marketing: Maybe other ones could be something else shaped.,1
Marketing: Like seen on regular mobile phones.,0
User Interface: I hope you appreciate the incorporation of some tin foil from a random KitKat bar.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, we have to Yeah, it is.",1
"Project Manager: Well yeah, I mean it is really basic looking is not it?",0
"Project Manager: Just have a look, are we going to this agenda of our meeting.",0
"Marketing: per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote, so probably if you have like one, two, three, four, five, the whole up to z ten, they probably do not use those, they only use the up, down channel.",0
Industrial Designer: maybe I'm too old for this stuff.,0
Project Manager: And we evaluated.,1
Marketing: Or we have to be sure that the batteries last couple of days when they are recharged.,0
"Project Manager: so, are they under twelve fifty? Yes, go to the project evaluation, next slide.",1
"User Interface: But you can use rechargeable batteries anyway, just you s you have to recharge them manual.",1
"Project Manager: But we save one Euro that way, yeah? So we come bring it down to Fifteen point four.",1
"Marketing: Something that is a little less crowded than this, like I mean you know, theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your TV, right?",1
"Project Manager: And we will make it spongy, well, the fruity thing is just the shape should be fru i did I think this is kind of fruity, you know.",1
Project Manager: Just put it on the market for everybody.,1
Industrial Designer: This is the remote control.,1
User Interface: The other is the finder feature yeah by whistling or whatever.,1
Industrial Designer: on the on the LCD screen you could becau you could fit it.,0
"Project Manager: well as I just showed, there is a project management folder, a project document folder on the desktop.",0
"Marketing: Yeah, but what he said about RSI was t kinda true.",1
"Marketing: The second two, you can see the last one is a very easy simple design.",1
"Industrial Designer: Peeling of the banana, you know,",1
Marketing: So like the power.,1
"Marketing: and but not important is the channel selection, the?",0
Industrial Designer: They are all one digit numbers right? And then you can count them together.,1
Project Manager: Who wants TFT?,0
"Industrial Designer: We can just go for, make it a selling point that it is just the basic.",1
Project Manager: One without LCD.,1
"Project Manager: Yeah, but you have an.",0
"Marketing: Remote control has to have to have a low power usage, because s w seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour, so the power usage is also one time an hour, or so, with a high power usage we would use a lot of but batteries.",1
"Project Manager: right now, the ID, UID, you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay.",1
"Marketing: Yeah, that is a good that is a good one,",0
"Industrial Designer: but that is not that is not what they are talking about, I think.",0
Project Manager: This is our functional design meeting.,1
"User Interface: No, because you choose by channel, so you choose by TV program.",1
"User Interface: So it should take out, well, eight buttons or so.",0
User Interface: I thought it was only for television.,1
"Industrial Designer: The user interface connected to a chip, which is connected to the sender, which generates messages using infrared light, which are sent to the receiver.",1
Industrial Designer: Give it one button.,0
"Project Manager: If we do it, we must do it in a kind of ways that like a profile, a parent profile, a family profile, otherwise.",0
User Interface: Computer is adjusting.,0
"Marketing: So, if we put an inflated price of fifty Euro at a production cost that cannot exceed twentyfive Euro, we are already in that price,",1
User Interface: We can dump the special colour.,1
"Project Manager: Yeah, bu but when we yeah, but when we skip when we when we do not use the do we are not gonna make the docking station, then we still yeah, we need something else maybe to make it kind of special,",1
"User Interface: if we decide to to implement that, maybe we should.",1
"Industrial Designer: then I do not think rechargeable is something we should you know, we really need to care about.",1
"User Interface: Yeah, so we gotta de.",0
"Marketing: That is because televisions, they do not give the remote control any type of feedback when you send it.",0
"User Interface: Well, the technical functions.",1
"Project Manager: eh? Does it need internet, or do we stay at basic television interface.",1
"Project Manager: and my role is basically to keep things going, make sure that you all work together in a productive way, so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product.",1
"Project Manager: Th that would be on one side, uhhuh.",0
Industrial Designer: But do not erase my cat.,0
"Industrial Designer: which I think if we make it curved like a hand like a handshape like if we put the scrollbutton on the side,",0
"Project Manager: And if you consider our budget, it probably.",1
Industrial Designer: it is just an idea I had so it is it is very so its also looks nice when it is on the table.,0
Project Manager: You have to paint now.,0
Industrial Designer: The metal is like in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller.,1
"Industrial Designer: So we have to understand what patterns are used to, you know, to make it universal.",1
Project Manager: It will It wo not have teletext.,0
User Interface: yeah this one we can remove for kids.,0
Industrial Designer: yeah I thought so just for just for ease of not having to replace the batteries.,0
"User Interface: I was also looking for what you said, for I got an email about LCD in front of the remote control.",1
"User Interface: but I'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote,",0
"Marketing: Although we had our separate tasks,",1
"Marketing: Right, we have done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control.",0
Marketing: Yeah that is right that should be an option.,0
User Interface: So basically that is it.,0
"Industrial Designer: So these were the component selection, these things.",0
"Industrial Designer: Which is the clunky one, the one on left or on the right?.",1
Marketing: Now you can clearly see young users say.,1
Project Manager: So I have to write it down.,0
"Project Manager: We are having a custom chip, but given the we have cut the functions down, that will hopefully not be too problematic, but given that technol technological innovation is important,",0
Project Manager: N yeah but I think that too less people would change it for good profit.,1
Project Manager: Attempts to contact coach ineffective.,1
Project Manager: So is it from sixteen to forty? Is it from twenty to forty? Is it from thirty?,0
User Interface: So that is the transmit the LED thing.,0
"Industrial Designer: But that Well, I'm not sure because for that to happen, you d you will have to receive a signal from the remote control, so it would, yeah, have to be constant constant signalling.",0
Project Manager: one thing to consider is that in some ways you want by having a fairly standard case it means they can all fit together on top of each other.,0
"User Interface: y you perhaps you should make it a bit big, so people know it is there,",1
"User Interface: Guys, I think we have to finish the meeting.",1
"Marketing: The results are, the feel of the material is expected to be strongy.",0
"Industrial Designer: or you said that yeah you had some ideas like fruit, veg or.",0
Project Manager: so now we are here at the functional design meeting.,1
User Interface: if we are I mean most of the of the replacement remote market is sort of remote control rationalisation.,0
"Project Manager: We have battery power, we have advanced chips, the sam the sensor.",1
"Industrial Designer: I suppose rubber is the closest to spongy,",1
"Industrial Designer: How many people would notice that, though?",1
"Project Manager: if we are if we were to follow that avenue, we might be s you know we are kind of almost relying on their experience with a mobile phone I suppose.",1
"Marketing: for our group, we are focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old, this is, these factors are slightly more equal.",1
"Project Manager: so if we go for the fifteen to thirty five age group, then of course we are going to get th anyone who is older than thirty five who wants to look young, hip, trendy, has the money,",0
"Marketing: But it could be someplace really obvious, you still would not be able to find it.",0
"User Interface: Well, maybe you can add it later that we decided in the end because of the cost.",1
Marketing: Still the end conclusion.,1
"Marketing: So if you throw it, it is gonna store loads of energy, you do not need to buy a battery 'cause they are quite f I find them annoying.",1
Marketing: But how many remotes do you see like this?,0
"Project Manager: are people maybe not happy with, but are willing to go ahead with this in going for a plastic solid case, to keep the LCD?",1
"Marketing: I like the idea too of being able to use the remote in the dark,",1
"Industrial Designer: I think it is it is a two, at least.",1
Project Manager: speech recognition I take it.,0
"Marketing: I just thought that it, it might be sucking more battery power, if there, if it is a light up.",1
Project Manager: So let is skip to this this idea.,0
User Interface: It is not very fashionable anymore.,0
"User Interface: well we also have to determine in some manner how to switch between modes, between going through your favourites list, just hitting up one, up two.",0
Project Manager: Why you why you put it in the side?,0
Industrial Designer: So this is a schematic overview.,1
"Project Manager: something easy to use, you said something easy to use but how does that fit in a fashion way, like with fruit, vegetable, about the colour, logo of the of the company, so on, now, can we do that? My first idea is because our colour is more yellow, the it should be easy to take in a hand, I thought about banana, or something like that, which is fruits,",1
"Industrial Designer: As you all know, you know m my job is to design you know to give an industrial design of the remote control.",1
"Marketing: and y you just touch it, or you just pick it up, it lights up or something.",1
"Industrial Designer: what I have to do? A look at what the other company so presently I am looking what is possible to use, what circuits to use, stuff like that because I did not work with these circuits so far so I have to look what is a v a v available on the market for the communication for the IR circuits, so on, so I'm currently looking what is available on the web.",0
"User Interface: cause it still fits in your hand, so you still wanted something that is comfortable, substantial, but not necessarily full of buttons.",1
Project Manager: Just like the colours of Real Reaction.,1
"Project Manager: Or sh we should just put it in as one, because the plastic is zero anyway.",1
Marketing: the findings seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly.,1
"Marketing: So after we have finished doing all the ratings for each criteria, we average that, that will give us some type of confidence in our prototype.",0
"User Interface: So we are having a combination of boards, so f on the s simpler board, on the top we have this button, rubber buttons, to keep frequently changing the channels.",1
"Marketing: Yeah, I will have a look.",0
"Project Manager: so I'm seeing that we are gonna just basically focus on this young demographic group, aim it at them, but then in a sense that its bells, whistles are available for anybody who wants them but basically we will make a sleek simple functioned remote control.",1
"Project Manager: So I guess what we are gonna talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project, the information we got on the news, how we used it, if we were able to, you know, use our creativity with the information, how well I guess I led it, the how well we worked together as a team, the digital pens, the whiteboard.",1
"Project Manager: And neither of them were very pretty, you know?",0
"Project Manager: Alright, let is have well, we all know that it is a remote control that we are gonna be dealing with.",0
"User Interface: if you look at the manuals from universal remotes, there are maybe three four hundreds TVs at maxim.",0
Industrial Designer: We I mean w one person s maybe said three.,0
Marketing: Takes too long to master the remote control.,1
Industrial Designer: So we can celebrate now.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, but we have not completely developed that side of it yet, so we are not completely sure about that,",0
"User Interface: to model the functionalities will increase actually,",0
"Marketing: Let is make this thing really exclusive, environmentally sensitive, hightech design, ergonomics, all of this.",1
"Project Manager: You have got voice recognition computers,",0
Industrial Designer: Would you mind at the conclusion of our meeting could you send us a copy of your slides?,0
"Project Manager: And, then we have to make some key decisions on, on our remote control concept, how we are gonna make it, what materials we are gonna use, that sort of thing.",1
User Interface: That is used pretty often.,0
Marketing: So f just go through onto the whiteboard I guess.,1
"User Interface: I think we will need a we will need a mode switch, but then if we have a mode switch we are gonna need some kinda indicator.",0
"User Interface: Although for actual design I'd say the response time should be a little bit higher,",1
"Industrial Designer: because well, it is just not the same when you touch a touch screen.",1
"Project Manager: Well what I what I agree is that when when you have such of an arc in the middle, so that the a the ends, the fronts is a bit thicker, so th then it falls over your hands.",1
"Marketing: The phones, the.",0
"User Interface: So you want us to draw it, then talk about it? Or just draw it?",0
User Interface: I have not been able to.,0
"Project Manager: But this is expensive, the sample speaker.",1
Marketing: Well I think it is pretty much in the middle.,0
Project Manager: I think we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had.,1
Project Manager: The User Interface Designer will work out the technical functions design.,1
Project Manager: You have some usability criteria or.,0
Project Manager: So we have to look at that as well.,1
"Marketing: So LCD screens should be easy, but an LCD screen, the problem with the L sc LCD screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years do not use the LCD screen a lot.",1
Industrial Designer: Disposable diapers is an example of that in fact.,0
"Project Manager: it is now quarter after twelve, we are given forty minutes for this meeting.",0
"Industrial Designer: And the display requires an advanced chip, which in turns is more expensive than the regular chip, but I think with twelve Euros, if it is made for four million items, then I think w we could be able to handle that.",1
"Industrial Designer: Maybe something that looks nice on a table is would be good, even though, handheld the same time.",0
Industrial Designer: Shall we make some outline sketches of the basic shape first?,0
"Marketing: So if we use s solar cells, where is the sun if someone is watching TV inside?",1
Marketing: Yeah so so finally we have these three criterias.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, but what do we ha we have LC display, but the wh but the s spinning wheel.",1
Marketing: Seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly.,1
Project Manager: we could use rechargeable batteries in the remote.,1
Marketing: one is means highest ranking.,0
"Project Manager: So we are, I think.",0
"Project Manager: So we have to make a decision, what kind of form it is gonna have t going to have.",1
Marketing: We can make a plain docking station for two Euros.,1
User Interface: You have it a bit Yeah.,0
User Interface: We can just extend it to any device.,1
"Industrial Designer: besides this in electr under electronics also the company has started making a sample sender, which is did not explained what i what it was, but I'm guessing that so they have a sample sender, a sample speaker.",1
"Marketing: You have to keep your pen separate, because I used your pen.",1
Marketing: A large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls.,1
"Marketing: So yeah, pretty close to a two.",1
"Industrial Designer: well, I will be talking about the components.",1
User Interface: But just inside.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, would it be flat on both the sides, would be curved from one side, or whatever.",0
"Project Manager: Yeah, it is.",0
"User Interface: And it is kind of along the s lines of environmentally sensitive, it may even fit into ergonomics, even kind of address the issue of losing the remote, what we were saying it is a common issue.",0
Industrial Designer: You have got the buttons.,0
Industrial Designer: If we are doing if we are doing a display.,0
Project Manager: It uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the TV apparatus or stereo.,1
"Industrial Designer: I think a logo, our company logo, the slogan should be or could be.",1
"Project Manager: What type, what supplements?",0
"Project Manager: One with LCD, one without LCD.",1
"Project Manager: I think the white that one on the right is, as well as less cluttered,",1
"User Interface: I think we should design something that has like a so you can like somehow like you I mean you always know where your TV is, so just have a call button,",1
"Industrial Designer: On the bottom we were gonna have the rubber, the rubber ones, the antiRSI ones.",1
"User Interface: You can have a look at it, That is all I wanted to say.",0
"Marketing: That is brightness, colour, tone, all that.",0
Industrial Designer: I gave this a one because of the rubber.,1
Project Manager: well you know how to the documents work.,1
User Interface: When it d takes a shock.,0
"Project Manager: So a teletext option, maybe we have to skip that one.",1
User Interface: So that is our end of things wha.,0
Industrial Designer: Instead of you do not have to like make sure it is in the right place to charge.,0
"Industrial Designer: You have to get a an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in, which is more expensive than the regular chip, which is more expensive than the minimal.",1
Marketing: seventy five percent of remote control users said that they zap a lot.,1
"Project Manager: I will act as secretary for this meeting, just take minutes as we go through, then I will send them to you after the meeting.",0
"User Interface: Yes the difference is, with a simple chip a simple chip will operate why does not this scroll up? Previous.",1
"Project Manager: so celebration, well, for the three of you,",0
User Interface: You do not have it in the States?,0
"Project Manager: we will invest in R, D.",0
Marketing: I think you have read it too.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, it did work pretty well.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, but suppose you have a family watching TV, if they want to use their private remote control in the same time, do you think it will work? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time?",0
User Interface: It is hard to lose.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, identification code inside the.",0
User Interface: So we can work together on it while we are.,0
"Project Manager: No, you can use the.",0
Marketing: Wait until I tell them I'm not coming back.,0
User Interface: just to keep the shape of the buttons simple.,0
"User Interface: so the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set, so that a desired function is performed.",1
User Interface: They are they are they are available in XML format or whatever the format.,0
"User Interface: double push, if double click, so you get big subtitles, for people which c f who ca not read small subtitles.",1
"Project Manager: Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert, Roo is here as the User Interface Designer, Sebastian is here in the role of Industrial Designer.",0
"Project Manager: I can see your point about the number keypad, but I have I would say that we can probably incorporate it into the menu system if you need to do traversal of a large number of channels.",1
"User Interface: Well, maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs, where the parent says, you cannot watch channel seven, nine, ten, you cannot watch all channels after ten o'clock.",1
User Interface: On something on the image of it.,0
Industrial Designer: And you can just browse into the navigation menu by joystick joysticklike button.,0
"Project Manager: you know, we will draw up we will draw up the ball, maybe th where the buttons are located.",0
"User Interface: Yeah, so there is a project I think called X house or something like that does that, you can integrate your remote with computers stuff.",1
"Marketing: I think with the way it looks, it is designed, I will give it a two.",1
Project Manager: We have forty minutes for this meeting.,1
Project Manager: So extra functionalities.,1
Project Manager: I well I think many people said in your in your research the appearance of the RC is important when they are buying one.,0
Project Manager: Phase two is the conceptual design.,1
"Project Manager: Nothing, it is right, I'm just There we go.",0
Marketing: We need to keep it consistent with other d.,0
Marketing: Yeah but that that is not a question.,0
"Industrial Designer: And a lot of the information on the PowerPoints, I do not think, you know, we needed to actually it could have, we could have gone through it verbally,",1
"Industrial Designer: and just beside that you can see a transistor, a cylinder shape, that one is a capacitor.",0
Industrial Designer: The last three bullets have been integrated from the last minute email.,0
Marketing: Why we decided to use a flat LCD.,0
"Project Manager: I will write minutes, if I can create them out of this.",1
"User Interface: We could make an option for it, but you can disable s.",0
"Project Manager: Yeah, but check it out.",0
"Marketing: Well, we ca not, with the price range.",1
Project Manager: So maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to keep our costs low.,0
Marketing: Small logo with the like a small yellow strip or y yellow with the logo in it.,0
"User Interface: For example the i the mobile phones nowaday, they sell different kinds of skin.",1
Industrial Designer: Maybe we should try something like that.,0
"Marketing: I do not know what you guys did while you were together, maybe that was a bit different,",0
"Marketing: Yeah, but rubber comes coloured, does not it? You know.",1
"User Interface: And you then have, at the at the bottom, the LCD, this would need to be articulated as well.",1
Project Manager: And the production cost should be the half of the selling price.,1
"Marketing: I was not very keen on that, but yeah.",0
"Marketing: And yeah so, people like to zap a lot apparently, so this is the order.",0
"Project Manager: another thing that I think is important is the d the design of the product, how it feels in your hand.",1
Industrial Designer: He is getting retarded.,0
"Marketing: I'm gonna write up our results on the board, so this will be a way for us to go through, decide if we are sort of review where we stand with it.",0
"Project Manager: No that is I think we should look at the ones that like where s where people said four, where it looks like we might wanna discuss changing an aspect of the remote.",1
User Interface: so maybe you could hurry up a bit.,0
"Industrial Designer: But I think more the features of the actual control will be more important than maybe than the actual aesthetics, but.",0
Industrial Designer: This is a model of the remote control which we are going to build.,1
"Project Manager: like it might be necessary for a TV but not for the remote c, you know.",0
Project Manager: We will see what see what.,0
Marketing: It is more if we if we do it.,0
Marketing: Do you all get what we are doing?,0
"Project Manager: We are gonna have three presentations, one from each of you again.",0
User Interface: And it is also conformable to the size of your hand.,0
Project Manager: Do you get a good grip on the rubber? Yeah.,0
"Industrial Designer: but generally speaking, we have kept the other attributes to the.",0
"Project Manager: And if you did not hear it in the room that you were standing in, then you'd realise that it was not in that room, you'd go into another room.",1
User Interface: it it is not Yeah.,0
"Marketing: And the other point I have not mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch,",0
"Marketing: And criteria seven, which is the last one, does it get lost?",0
Marketing: is that 'cause it is flat?,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, who wou who would have the money to spend.",1
Project Manager: Looks like we going for a double curved design.,1
Project Manager: In this meeting we will discuss our final design.,1
Industrial Designer: Often in the form of infrared bits.,1
"Project Manager: Well, not necessarily.",0
"User Interface: Perhaps you can make adjustable fronts, like with the telephones.",1
Marketing: That is easy.,0
Project Manager: th the shape you got trendy.,1
Project Manager: it is just for small vocabulary.,0
Marketing: Well maybe we need specific costings then.,1
"Marketing: because we are focusing on that,",0
"Project Manager: Right, there you go.",0
"Marketing: It is really borrowing from other areas, it is, you know, bringing things from other areas in,",1
"Project Manager: Just a scroll? It is not one of the scrolls where, for example, with this one you could push it down to be a button?",0
Industrial Designer: and has the cover on it.,0
"User Interface: So we have to make buttons for that as well, to make it.",1
Project Manager: So you see green if you push that button.,1
Industrial Designer: Like as a backup for something.,1
"User Interface: Yeah, it is very easy.",0
"Project Manager: Like doing a spongy layer of the banana, you open it.",0
"Marketing: Is it to scale, or do you think you can make it a bit smaller?",1
"Marketing: about half of, half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use.",1
User Interface: It is not much.,0
"Industrial Designer: Well, we discussed it in a previous meeting, so I figured I will just leave it at the LCD.",1
"User Interface: That was our main technological innovation w every everything else was fairly simple, but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new.",1
"Marketing: Well, more information in the beginning.",0
"User Interface: I do not think you should be able to mould it,",0
"Project Manager: Yeah, ex for your fingers, yeah.",0
"Marketing: And finally, the incorporation of a LCD or a speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting, but I do not know if the budget would be large enough.",1
Industrial Designer: To have different technologies.,0
"User Interface: I think it would be annoying though if I do not use teletext that much, but if it was on your TV, you'd want to be able to use it, if.",1
User Interface: So you have to have a button on your on your you have to attach the button to the.,0
"User Interface: some of the remotes that I looked at, one of the models da did actually have voice recognition where you could where it was connected to the remote control functions.",0
"Industrial Designer: and also our personal coach helped us along the way,",1
"Marketing: And then sort of even wackier than that, we could maybe have a fruit or vegetable shaped remote, say in the shape of a banana or something like that.",1
"Industrial Designer: So I plug it in, press F five? Function F five?",1
User Interface: The looks remain the same.,0
"Industrial Designer: We could initially go with what we have, if we can find them cheaper later on.",0
"Industrial Designer: So maybe I should include that here as well,",0
"Marketing: The volume button, the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control, so those they those have to h be find very easily.",1
Project Manager: Four or five between.,1
Marketing: That is the only one we put in there.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, actually if you have got a lot of channels, the number keypad can be quite annoying as well, becau it is you know if you are trying to remember what, you know, what number is the discovery channel or whatever.",1
Project Manager: First I will introduce myself.,1
"Project Manager: Or seven maybe, yeah.",1
"User Interface: I really un unless you guys are diehard against the fact that it is possible like it reduces the usability of the remote b, the fact that you ca not lose it on your own, I think it still might be a good idea to investigate having like a power cradle.",1
User Interface: you are not gonna be staring at it for five minutes.,0
User Interface: It is at least on the positive side.,0
"Project Manager: Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.",0
Marketing: I have lined them up here.,0
"User Interface: You have received the same email, right?",0
Project Manager: I do not think here it is in here already.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, that is a very good point.",0
Marketing: Otherwise we would not we will not sell.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, so we have everything.",0
Marketing: So I don I think I think it is a three.,1
Industrial Designer: Does anyone know if VCRs are the same across international?,0
"Marketing: And we need we need it to be simple, yet it needs to be hightech looking.",1
Marketing: So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly.,1
Marketing: And our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much the material for older people.,1
"Project Manager: It would be like saying we are using See, it says case material.",1
"Industrial Designer: I think it is two too, two too.",1
User Interface: Well we can try to make it special.,1
"User Interface: Actually I would say maybe two function buttons, the y we are now using the menus button, an og, an button.",0
"Industrial Designer: So, I mean But, I guess, we have to look at w what our production cost is for the chip itself anyway.",1
"Project Manager: If, but I say if people are getting RSI from it then then then perhaps we are looking at the wrong market.",0
"Marketing: But i if you all make the m having a bottom like this, then they all fit.",0
Marketing: Is it easy to find? .,0
"Project Manager: We have two scroll, we have three push buttons.",1
User Interface: so here is just a basic layout of how the remote would work.,0
"User Interface: So still then, if you feel li if you feel your remote control, you just rub on the cover, so you rub on the painting.",1
"Project Manager: we after this we can consider for instance, making this more attractive to the demographic.",0
"Industrial Designer: You can also have it, maybe, talking about mobile phones again, sliding open.",1
"Project Manager: Alright, given that information, we need to start making some more specific decisions.",0
"User Interface: Well, it looked more than a bunny than a cat, but it works,",0
"User Interface: Yeah, it is very, you know.",0
"Industrial Designer: Like we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or whenever the TV is on suppose,",0
Project Manager: you know now the basic the basic things.,0
"Marketing: Brian, this one also I.",0
"Marketing: Well, it is actually a very innovative n different idea that you know you can choose your colour of wood, your type of wood.",1
Marketing: there is a button missing.,0
"User Interface: Maybe it would be interesting if you could look for the cost inventories of other devices, if you are using speech recognition or something like that.",1
"User Interface: Well, if you hold it, you can you all can hold it, is it does actually feel quite ergonomic,",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, or maybe The channel buttons are often used.",1
User Interface: user interface design d industrial design?,0
Industrial Designer: I do not know.,0
Project Manager: but I could think of a more attractive c set of colours.,0
Industrial Designer: I think that is the price.,0
"Project Manager: I'm not sure y I'm not sure it is if it is expensive, but just take a look at it, because it might be a very good idea.",1
"Project Manager: but yeah I like that, I like that, the voice recognition for the paging system.",1
"Project Manager: I think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost, then I'd put them in,",1
"Marketing: Yeah, I'm the one who takes the heat.",0
"Project Manager: So, thank you very much.",0
Project Manager: I agree with if we are targeting young adults then it would be something we should look into.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, so then this is it is almost true,",1
"Industrial Designer: It can be s yeah, it can still be single curved,",1
Project Manager: then then that that is the sort of coverage that we want.,0
"User Interface: That sort of like joystick flat touch thing, yeah.",1
"Marketing: I think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number,",1
"User Interface: Yeah so it is something like this, the model here.",0
Industrial Designer: It has to feel nice in your hand.,1
Project Manager: Well I do not think I have anything more to add at the moment.,0
"Industrial Designer: And of course this low part, this is the LCD screen.",1
"User Interface: Well I guess if you use the LCD screen, you first have to search where is the on button, then you you then turn it, then the TV goes on.",1
User Interface: I'm going to look at the technical design from the user point of view.,0
"Project Manager: In the meantime, the Industrial Designer over here is gonna work on the look, feel design,",1
"User Interface: Well yes, I think that is a good idea.",0
User Interface: but with special colour we have.,1
Industrial Designer: but going towards a little bit higher than medium kind of thing.,0
Industrial Designer: well the animal I'd like to draw is a tiger.,1
User Interface: but so they could I think it is.,1
"User Interface: just like the phones Yeah,",0
"Marketing: also, in contra in contrast to last year, the feel of the material is expected to be spongy.",1
"Industrial Designer: At four it is gonna be too heavy, so that that is not our problem.",0
Project Manager: And this was the Interface Designer? Or the Interaction Designer.,0
"Industrial Designer: and numbers, that every culture in, yeah, people in every country can recognise.",1
"Marketing: So as you know, you I think you already know me, Sammy Benjo.",1
"Marketing: Most buttons are not used any more, like you said, teletext is outdated now.",1
"Project Manager: So we have ha to ma make it in black, black, yellow.",1
"Project Manager: I'd say though that we if we did make the decision to go with the cradle though, the then we have that as well,",1
Project Manager: This time it should come up both.,0
"Marketing: Cause it is a big I think fifty per cent of the users loses his its control, within the same room.",0
"Industrial Designer: so, here are a plastic, latex.",0
Industrial Designer: I did not take a major in art.,0
Project Manager: And maybe a low battery indicator? On the screen.,0
User Interface: normally I was one of them.,0
Industrial Designer: So I think it is better we go for ordinary buttons.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, yes, or sample sensor, yes.",0
"Industrial Designer: N if we want to make it special, we probably have to do a lot of testing, if it really works.",1
"User Interface: Well you see, that is why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it, because then it'd just be rigid.",1
Marketing: and half important as technology is easy to use.,0
"User Interface: But there is not a way to compute that, I mean, since we saved on the on the production cost, do we know how much we are making on profit?",1
Marketing: So they also get to pick.,0
"Industrial Designer: But I was thinking that he is a user 'cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be, you know.",1
User Interface: Would you like the buttons horizontal or v vertical?,0
User Interface: So they cluster the buttons together.,1
"Project Manager: It is in the house, is not it, I suppose.",0
"Marketing: So, this not very important.",1
Project Manager: Cause I think the reason they are long is yeah.,0
Marketing: And the third problem was to find the remote control.,1
User Interface: The voice recognition area actually doubles as as the solar cell area.,0
"Project Manager: I know each of you have a presentation, in thinking about the forty minutes, I thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes, each of you having about seven minutes or maybe a little more, maybe a little less for your pre presentations, a little discussion, because there is I happen to have been told there were some new project requirements, we have to make some decision on what functions it will have.? Is this ap everybody agree with this?",1
"Industrial Designer: it is not like that, I have referred the page to get new ideas or like what can be the working design to how it works, all, so, so.",0
Project Manager: What did you guys think about the roles?,0
Project Manager: So what are we deciding to do here?,0
"User Interface: Only buttons we need is on off, volume, channels, maybe some options or something else, please make a click, compared to this one.",1
"Industrial Designer: We will, we could do that.",0
User Interface: So I I like I like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often.,0
"Marketing: Since we are on the topic of the technology, are there any like what are our options?",0
Marketing: It is one.,0
"User Interface: And a single function remote control, used specifically for the television.",1
"Industrial Designer: a large onoff button, demographically we are moving towards an older generation of people, so a large onoff button would probably be good.",1
Project Manager: It does not mean that the other buttons are not necessary or important.,0
Marketing: What would I like?.,0
"Industrial Designer: Now this is not a very good overhead, but this is just to show you, this is the innards of a remote control.",0
"Marketing: One meaning that, ye yes it fulfils the criterion, whatever it is.",1
Industrial Designer: I think this is a brilliant product.,1
Project Manager: It is also a It is both the SMARTboards.,0
Industrial Designer: Wait why did I put three?,0
"Project Manager: Every meeting we everybody can present their their views, everything, so to help with these, you have we have the SMARTboards here.",1
Industrial Designer: Then there is the zero to one to zero buttons.,0
Marketing: Everything I have is kinda background.,0
"Marketing: if we go to the next slide, here you can find these are the latest fashion updates, so this in Paris, Milan they have detected this trends that the this year it is going to be an year of fruit, vegetable, so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable, or whatever they like.",1
Project Manager: Here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve.,1
"User Interface: Yeah, the ten plus button.",1
User Interface: and as well as it is like a blinking one.,1
"Project Manager: Well I think especially because of the microphone, the LCD screen also.",0
"Industrial Designer: Well, training is always an issue with commands.",0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, because when you touch the LCD screen when it is in standby mode, it should pop on.",1
Marketing: This is not familiar for them.,1
"Marketing: And the second thing is, if the material, they really do not want it to be very hard, as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium, it should be somewhat spongy.",1
"Industrial Designer: Obviously something small that is Yeah, that is a good point.",0
"Marketing: So the marketing made an evaluation criteria, these were some of the findings, in the market the people are not really interested with LCD, without LCD, with speech recognition interface, or without speech recognition interface, but most of the people what they are interested is first thing is, they want to have an fancy look, feel, it should be very fancy with colourful, very handy to hold.",1
"User Interface: But this has to be has to be trendy,",0
User Interface: and maybe the actual controls are inside or something.,0
Industrial Designer: Do you think?,0
User Interface: Whoops I forgot to put the thing on.,0
User Interface: So here is this remote control.,1
"Project Manager: It would be nice for changing the volume,",1
Marketing: I like that.,1
"Industrial Designer: It is gonna cost a long way to c you know, cost a lot of money to market it, is it?",1
Marketing: So you can go.,0
"Project Manager: we would use plastic with a rubber casing, I think was the consensus, powered by kinetic energy.",1
"Industrial Designer: So these are important nbers that Matthew, I need to take into account for our functional.",0
"User Interface: Then it should have a next button, next button channel by which you can keep on v eh scrolling the channels one by one.",1
Industrial Designer: A big recognisable button on top or something.,1
Marketing: Well that is about twenty per cent I thought.,0
"User Interface: It is curved, easy to hold, handheld, nice, small with big easy buttons.",1
"Project Manager: the waiting is for our Marketing Expert, Ruud.",1
"User Interface: apart from maybe doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue, like the casing.",1
"Marketing: In Paris, Milan, we asked different people, differing in age, in income, the amount of money to spend, what they like in design, material nowadays.",0
"User Interface: Yeah, that is gonna be what is communicating with the TV, but the other bulb, I think, is good to just to indicate, I'm doing something, it is sort of like a reassurance.",1
Project Manager: I would say five or six.,0
"Project Manager: I mean, you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically, but.",1
User Interface: because we need to find out what people want before we make firm decisions on this.,0
"Industrial Designer: which would allow say a banana, but unfortunately I see from my notes that if we do that, we have to have a push button as the interface,",1
Marketing: It must make all the difference.,0
"User Interface: Well, my issue with that is if it got too big though, 'cause if you have the circle, the button in the middle, then is it gonna get wider than your hands are,",0
Project Manager: Or get your mouse.,0
Project Manager: Let is see.,0
"Marketing: But, I think there is one other thing interesting two things that are interesting is that from the fifteen to thirtyfive yearold group, which always spends more money on trendy new things, speech recognition is requested.",1
"Industrial Designer: Well, I guess you get the idea.",0
Marketing: you are much taller than me so I'm gonna write down here.,0
"User Interface: And t s simplest approach that I came to is to change, programme, operate an electronic device remotely.",0
"Project Manager: Cause at that point then you have got the details up there, so if we wanted to know for instance that the scroll wheel required the regular what required advance.",1
"Project Manager: if we if we are going down that route, then we need some sort of display.",1
Project Manager: all our whi SMARTboard notes should be kept in the same file.,0
Project Manager: And some summaries for what is going on.,0
"Marketing: Is the design fancy, on a scale of one to seven?",1
Project Manager: And that way we can focus on our form.,0
"Marketing: We will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements, whether it meets the user requirements or not, this product.",1
"Project Manager: The one thing we missed though, we do not have a product name.",1
Marketing: so the functional requirements are is is part of my goal but why do not we pass right to the second slide.,0
"Marketing: and then, then very bright, a yellow banana, an orange, a green apple, stuff like that,",1
"User Interface: second as already discussed with William, we are going to have m maybe a G GUI interface in the f in the middle of the fliptop.",0
"Industrial Designer: Well, as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the device, like TV or VCR or DVD player etcetera.",1
"Industrial Designer: I mean, when it when it lights up as we I mean it could light up when the alarm went.",0
"Industrial Designer: this is basis station is nothing more, just it is a wire which is coming from the main cable, you are having one socket on which the thing sits.",1
"Marketing: At the budget that we are looking at, at the price point we are looking at, we should be able to make it work the TV, the VCR, the stereo set maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp.",1
"User Interface: Yeah, but that is not what is meant here, I think.",0
"Project Manager: so, I was originally, I was thinking rubber was not special,",1
"Industrial Designer: You press it, your TV set starts to make a kind of weird sound, your remote controls then start to beep.",0
"Industrial Designer: It is fine, so.",0
"Marketing: Yeah, that is.",0
"Marketing: It can be done, I mean, you ca not harm it,",1
Industrial Designer: So spe buttons are something which is very everybody is familiar with.,0
Project Manager: I'm going to finish my end report.,1
User Interface: Just dark grey I think.,1
"Marketing: But when use it, I do not know what is good thing of speech recognition.",1
Project Manager: so this is quite easy.,0
"Industrial Designer: It is also a trend, so I will give it a two.",1
"Marketing: I can give you a number,",1
User Interface: You want Yeah it must be a remote.,0
"Industrial Designer: then on to the circuit board that we are gonna use, also known as the chip.",1
Industrial Designer: That was exactly my point.,1
"Project Manager: I'm just gonna open, say a few boring words to start with again, start taking minutes afterwards.",1
"Marketing: And maybe we run the evaluation on both of the products, both of these two.",1
Project Manager: Yeah I see a long neck.,0
Industrial Designer: You can zap away.,0
Project Manager: Yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost.,1
User Interface: I think so too.,0
"User Interface: C 'cause then it would only be a applicable to one TV set, so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere, or something.",0
"User Interface: Yeah, it does seem like our responsibilities have some overlap.",0
"Marketing: When we were talking about rubber,",1
"Marketing: So I say inspiration, so having something beauty, something attractive, something that in a sense will sell itself.",1
Marketing: Something that looks does not look like remote control.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, find a little compromise in that, but What did I write down?",0
Project Manager: this is only for drawing.,0
User Interface: The back end of an elephant.,0
User Interface: But I had a lot of pictures I can show you here what the old ones look like.,0
Industrial Designer: but if you can work around that noise problem.,0
"Project Manager: So I will close the meeting, just after that we will have lunch break.",1
"Marketing: Yeah, I mean it is people say that it is the look, they want the fancy looking thing but I'm Yeah.",0
"Marketing: Well no I think w we should just, we should then just design one.",1
Industrial Designer: So this was the my personal preference was that we can have ASR sitting there on the remote control.,1
Industrial Designer: We can put it on the on the back side.,1
"Industrial Designer: right? So you wanna click on it, activate it, whe, when you move it, hear the difference of the treble coming out or going into the sound.",0
"Marketing: So it m it may be too complicated for us, but it is something to keep in mind anyway.",1
Marketing: this would mean we would have to make a fancy design.,0
"Marketing: So how well would you say the prototype is how well have we realised the dream of being able to stop remotes from being lost, or to be able to find them once they are lost.",1
Project Manager: But then the biggest costs are the buttons.,1
"Project Manager: Plus six, I say I said seven.",1
"Project Manager: So, we have to change something.",1
"Industrial Designer: That is when the circuit is closed, it produces the pattern.",1
User Interface: What do I think is necessary item?,0
"Marketing: I did have one other one other frame I thought, I mean I d not knowing how we would deal with this information, I thought in theory this kind of a process would be about refining our design, revisiting our original goals.",1
Project Manager: That is right.,0
Project Manager: I believe I should be taking minutes on this right now.,1
Industrial Designer: and we should use wood or something like that.,0
"Marketing: Also not only the drawing, the making of the thing itself, but also in explaining it to the other people, by means of.",1
Project Manager: So you do not come up with the user requirements who do not fit the technical functions at all.,0
"User Interface: we get the general ideas, yes.",0
"Marketing: Only the numbers, only numbers.",1
"User Interface: yeah, but then you will lose.",0
Project Manager: so are we done with the this presentation?,0
"Project Manager: Just draw slowly, because otherwise it wo not work.",1
"Project Manager: we can make the price fit,",0
Industrial Designer: yeah I dunno.,0
Project Manager: You can use the LCD in a good way.,1
"User Interface: Yeah, we might need a scroll wheel, right, for that?",1
User Interface: But it is possible to make one for twelve fifty.,0
Marketing: why do not you move just to the next slide right away.,0
"Industrial Designer: I figure if you had two different remotes, you could bo choose one with well a receiver in it.",0
"Project Manager: Yes, there is actually.",1
"Project Manager: So if you wanna show something, put it in the shared folder.",1
"User Interface: we need a programmable digital signal processor to to take the input from the user, translate that into into electronic signal, which we pass to the infrared LED, which you aim at the television which it receives that signal.",1
"User Interface: But we are to make it unique so that people want to buy it, will this two features together.",0
Project Manager: you have to put your laptop exactly in that field so the little cameras can see your face.,0
"Marketing: And the functionality As a lot of people indicated, they only use about ten percent of the buttons, I think we should make very few buttons.",1
Marketing: Can I have channel five?,0
"Industrial Designer: Like I said, use one button for instance for m multiple functions, or well just hide the few buttons o of switching it open or something, the usual stuff.",1
"Industrial Designer: if you want just a normal button version, the chiponprint is gonna be.",0
"Project Manager: so brightness, contrast, things like that,",1
"Project Manager: Do not you think we can, if we can count this as v as one button, integrate th these buttons in three, then we save a lot of money as well.",1
"Project Manager: Is that an option, a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots?",1
Project Manager: well I think we are ready to begin.,0
"User Interface: Right, I was thinking on the same lines you, instead of having too many b buttons, make it complicated for the user, may h maybe have an LCD di display or something like that, like a mobile, yeah, with menus.",1
User Interface: I do not think so.,0
"User Interface: Additional feature on the back is that you can have your own customised backing, I suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on the front.",0
User Interface: What was our target price again?,0
Marketing: So the users of forty six to sixty five years cons The make up forty percent of the market.,1
Marketing: Yeah or a t Teletubby front.,0
"Marketing: But I think if you are targeting people of forty plus, the chance that they will have a TV with internet access within the next like twenty years is very slim.",1
"Project Manager: Well, I would say that the most you could probably hope for is gaining a year is lead on most people anyway.",1
User Interface: You have the wider section for the main controls there.,0
User Interface: And that I think could work.,0
Marketing: People want to have a power button.,1
"Industrial Designer: I think it will be the mid range to the high end market, in terms of people.",1
"Project Manager: Who just have or already have a job, have the money but may not want to spend that much money on a on a universal control.",0
"Marketing: that would, are willing to pay extra.",0
"Industrial Designer: you have a transmitter, an input device, logic chip,",1
Marketing: The computer programmes are good.,1
User Interface: because every time you are off the computer the TV you are asked the command the TV com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where to the charger.,0
Project Manager: maybe for next meeting send me your presentation before by email so that we can see them altogether.,0
Industrial Designer: It is a micro array.,0
Industrial Designer: I can I can take note.,0
Project Manager: But Now let is look.,0
"User Interface: I mean if it w if we get a major television manufacturer to say y yeah we will have that, save us the bother, then that is you know vast amounts of sales.",0
"User Interface: Well, that could be No you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons.",1
"Marketing: Learnable? Easy to use? Yeah, we shall test it But.",0
User Interface: So let is start with this.,0
Marketing: One thing I was thinking though is.,0
User Interface: It is a very basic minimal thing.,0
"User Interface: No, not fronts.",0
"Project Manager: Yeah, but I m but it is I know for sure that some televisions that w th the remote control supplied, only ha has the c these buttons with a one, a dash, a two, a dash, but when you use a bu a n remote control that does not sport these buttons, it still works.",1
Project Manager: I really like that kinetic battery though.,0
"Industrial Designer: The good news is that we can we decided to use the infrared unit because our company has also developed the chip for communication by the infrared, including all the stuff inside, so it will be very cheap for us.",0
Project Manager: well I guess we have to.,0
"Project Manager: So each person in turn, I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard, the pen is just underneath it there, draw your favourite animal, then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are, while you are doing that tell us your name, what your role is, perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you are taking in this project.",1
"Project Manager: Not a mouse, a rat.",1
Industrial Designer: And thus gives on the signal.,0
"User Interface: we had a latest finding of voice recognition, there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature.",1
Project Manager: but I think that is I think the LCD screen is more worth than speech recognition.,0
"User Interface: This one is got a kind of scroll like a mouse,",1
"User Interface: And, that is one of the that is one of the shock I mean there are people that have a remote control, they are worried that it is going to break, they put some extra plastic around it.",0
"Project Manager: yeah, I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it, but I do not know, what do you think? It just said, for TV only.",1
"Project Manager: That is a sketching of my elk, it, it is my favourite animal right now, 'cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature,",1
Project Manager: I have think maybe it is integrated with the LC display?,0
"Industrial Designer: You just have a f a few selected buttons, a few menus, with this idea you could actually make several you can also improve later on.",0
"Project Manager: then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work, I'm sure your personal coaches will assist you with it.",0
Industrial Designer: So I guess it'd be something we could like attach to the or like the same technology could be put inside the inside the remote.,1
"Industrial Designer: So electronic parts are assembled onto printed boards because it is easier to mass produce, assemble.",0
Marketing: you ca not tell what they do.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, it is we can save this.",0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, I will go with five.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, that is twelve point three,",0
"Marketing: Or it could be possible to have a standard version of the remote, an expanded version.",1
Industrial Designer: it a lot longer than an off the shelf chip.,1
Marketing: I do not I dunno I do not think that is.,0
Industrial Designer: Shall we all try to think about a name?,0
Project Manager: Double curved? One of those?,0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah that is needed, yeah.",0
Project Manager: And I hope I can convince the management on that.,0
"Industrial Designer: All the way to the top, yeah that is up to desktop.",0
Industrial Designer: I it just shows what sort of energy source.,1
User Interface: I do not think a rubber case looks.,0
Marketing: there was a little problem with my computer so not the whole presentation.,0
"Marketing: and that is gonna take battery power, to make that to make that a realistic goal I think one of the issues that will come up later is, can the battery power it?",0
Marketing: of course n saying we aim at the young group does not say that old people wo not buy it.,0
"Industrial Designer: They want everything, but simply.",0
"Industrial Designer: But remote controls remote controls nowadays can last two years, three years, with t two batteries.",0
"Project Manager: so, this is the great product kids, I think we have created something really interesting, that we have a market for it, especially if we can produce it at twelve point three.",1
"Project Manager: would be an awful lot of these, would be like what, a hundred million of them to make twenty five Euros on each one, to make a total profit of fifty million.",1
"Marketing: Warning, finish meeting now.",1
"Marketing: but we still have to put our chips inside, so of course.",0
Marketing: well I was really thinking a lot about the I the iMac kind of gel gem tone.,0
"Industrial Designer: right? 'Cause I was thinking if we wanted to get the high in market then you could produce a few in titanium,",1
Industrial Designer: Come up with new product.,1
"User Interface: Well yeah, then we have to make some nice features.",1
"Industrial Designer: If c If we do If we use one, then we will have just a switch on it, you will just switch it, now it is the sound to switch back.",0
"Industrial Designer: When you use titanium, silver is fancy,",0
"Industrial Designer: actually we just have a plastic case, then we lose two points,",1
"User Interface: It is th right now it is only R, but.",0
"Industrial Designer: Well, you know, I kind of think that in general you have to do y you have to have something that is very fashionable, that is very attractive that people see, recognize its goal, they immediately wanna have it have one of their own.",0
"Marketing: If we flip open, now you know how you have got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them, you turn away, it gives like an advertising display, you seen those?",0
"Project Manager: you will get specific instructions, of what to do in the next half an hour.",1
"Marketing: Either you have voice recognition by itself, which I think is a bit impractical for like night time if you wanna be watching television, you wanna be quiet, or I do not know you have a visitor coming round, the remote is only trained for you, it is a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself.",1
"User Interface: Could it be possible to have, you know, like a rechargeable internal battery, like, well, like an MP three player does? With that you could jus or a mobile phone or whatever.",1
"Project Manager: As you said, you know, do not make it too hard for the granny.",1
"Marketing: Then teletext is useless for them I think,",1
"User Interface: from the innovation aspect I feel that what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that the retrieval of TV programmes by content, because that is really innovative, for now another innovation we have is simplicity, simplicity, few buttons, we have A lot of functionalities.",0
"Marketing: Like my telephone, it is it is sensitive too.",0
"Marketing: second point, we have to impro improve the most used functions, as I said here, switching channels, teletext, vole controls.",1
"Project Manager: D do we have actually any concept of what the difference is between a simple chip, an advanced chip?",1
Project Manager: the thing is the most important things that we have now.,0
"Marketing: But in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more,",1
"Industrial Designer: say you wanna pick up the phone, there is a mute button, right, so you have you have a choice of putting it on to others or a device.",0
"Project Manager: Project evaluation project satisfaction, for example.",1
Marketing: And you might be You might be target customer.,0
"Industrial Designer: I guess they would be either in the colour of that plastic face on the front, or in the colour of the squishy thing underneath.",1
Marketing: And they want to keep the old things the old things.,0
"Project Manager: We maybe are not as happy with it as we'd like to be, but we have got something we think we can maybe stick onto the market, sell.",0
Marketing: To make it a little bit easier.,0
"Project Manager: So, by next meeting, so, please come up with the prototype, then, then we can proceed from there.",1
User Interface: Move to the meeting room.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, the sides maybe is good.",1
Project Manager: We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition.,1
"Project Manager: You have to make people buy it, We can really can do the docking thing, it is not yeah, we can do it, but it is would be a easy way out.",1
"User Interface: Well, should it be larger buttons in general, you know like the examples that I had, they were swi quite small.",1
"Project Manager: I'm a student, but on the other hand I would think, with my Project Manager salary, I would think yeah I could probably afford this.",0
"User Interface: apart from that, it is just pretty much the same as we discussed last time.",1
"Marketing: I think well, we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something.",1
"Project Manager: So what ideas do you have for it, for the new remote control? What does it have to have?",1
"User Interface: Can I just check? Is this just a television remote? Because a lot of systems are kind of TV video combined now, or TV DVD combined.",1
"Marketing: according to the frequency of use, the relevance of each buttons, I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance.",0
"Project Manager: So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic, the fascia that comes off would be the rubber,",1
"User Interface: And then on the right is obviously an iPod, which is you know possibly one of the simplest things to use out there, really is, all that is just a nice big scroll menu that y you sort of go through.",1
"Project Manager: I will put the minutes of every meeting, I will put them there too, so everybody can read up if they have to leave early or whatever.",1
"Marketing: Like so backlighting, that would be good.",1
Industrial Designer: So it should be strong.,1
Industrial Designer: So well we can probably wait until t we have more knowledge on that.,1
"Industrial Designer: it is not, it is not really eyecatching, except for the colour.",1
"User Interface: most standard have volume, of course, a mute function, of course, the next, previous channel.",0
Project Manager: if that is if you are finished.,0
"Marketing: It is pretty cool, they have got a pretty good habitat, they are pretty sometimes, sometimes vicious but that is.",0
"Marketing: yeah, still taking the inspiration from the mobile phone design so functionality, the way the mobile phones work, the way the keypad looks.",1
"Project Manager: So, the general outline of new project will be we first go through a functional design phase.",0
"User Interface: We have a nber of different choices for a design concept s that is something that I will show you some examples of, but essentially we need to choose how is this device going to work,",0
"Marketing: I thought it was, but the advanced settings, screen, audio, channel.",0
"Marketing: If we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not, we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this this point, like for speech recognition in a remote control.",1
"Industrial Designer: Could be something special to our remote control, it is possible, but it only cost a bit more, but maybe it can be within the limits of twenty five Euros.",1
"Industrial Designer: Now what I was thinking about that was 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things, they have got little lights on behind the buttons, so you can see what all the buttons are, like on a mobile phone, they do it more often than on a than on a TV remote,",1
"Industrial Designer: But, to have a trendy remote control, we can also make something like the Nokia mobile phones.",1
Industrial Designer: Yeah then w then you would have to make it like this.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, I mean do they Is that something they want actually written on it, 'cause it is quite long.",1
"Industrial Designer: And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them, because they will need to switch 'em out.",1
Industrial Designer: But I think we'd also wanna go for e a simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down.,1
Project Manager: But we do have thirteen different Dutch channels.,0
"Marketing: Oops, dear, what happened there?",0
"Marketing: So if we have a LCD on the remote, rather than looking onto the TV you just look into a remote, navigate it.",1
"Industrial Designer: Well, I do not think.",0
"Marketing: Well, we have a kind of broad TV at home, a DVD player, so we got like a lot of remote controls, one for the TV, one for the video recorder, one for the DVD player.",1
User Interface: And we have been talking about it the whole time.,0
User Interface: For instance like a mobile phone or something like that.,1
Industrial Designer: I would not be able to do it that fast.,0
"Project Manager: and now we are gonna complete the final questionnaire, meeting summary, then we are going to have a big giant party, apparently, according to this, so.",0
"Industrial Designer: If in the LCD we can scroll, right? But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button.",1
"Industrial Designer: what we do need to consider, however, is that the price is going up for the ever every such thing that we are considering, but since LCDs seems to be a definite yes,",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, but maybe if you wanna look into that just to just to check.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yes, I agree too.",0
Project Manager: I want a share in the space rocet.,0
"Marketing: I th myself, voice recognition kind of scares me off.",1
"Project Manager: and, you know, whether the you know, the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow.",1
Marketing: And something like an LCD screen.,1
"Marketing: yeah I liked it, yeah.",1
"Marketing: Eight, the remote control has fresh, fruity colours.",1
"Industrial Designer: the identification of the components, since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects, I would need feedback from the marketing person, from the user interface person.",0
"Project Manager: The You were saying that the kinetic would be useful, that is you just have to move it some, you'd be able to use it as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or keep replacing the batteries.",1
"Project Manager: Would we need a more advanced one for the lighting, the interior lighting system?",0
Marketing: It is really the people twenty five to thirty five.,0
"Project Manager: I have not looked at it, but let is just start it off, we will see what happens.",0
User Interface: So I found out that but the main purpose of a remote is to f control the function of a television at a far off distance at remote distance.,0
"Marketing: the remote control, the docking station should blend in the in the room.",0
Industrial Designer: They will see one of each as grey.,0
"Marketing: And this These are all I found, or I wrote down.",0
"User Interface: A command line where you obviously type things in, you get a response.",1
"Marketing: I think we have a few functions, we can put the LCD above it, still have lots of room at the bottom, where you can put your hand.",1
Industrial Designer: Because you ca not really see which way round it is.,0
"User Interface: But a not as normal button, in the LCD,",1
"Industrial Designer: Could I just could I just jump in, suggest something quickly?",0
Marketing: The other criterion is it technologically technologically in innovative.,0
"User Interface: I do not think I at any stage in my life I would want a banana remote control, really.",1
"Project Manager: if we just had all the buttons as standard, except for the one red apple, then that would take care of that, I guess.",0
"Project Manager: well, just to finish up, should we s go with this plan, start making some Are good ideas, what are not.",1
Project Manager: Like maybe have menu things.,1
"Project Manager: and where Superman go banana,",0
"Marketing: But I mean if I s if I see this, it is I think we are just gonna go for another.",1
Marketing: I mean I sometimes use that.,0
"Project Manager: Limit the number of buttons, user friendly.",1
Project Manager: This is the functional design meeting.,1
"Industrial Designer: It is not a proper circuit, I'm not sure if it'd work or not, I'm not even confident that those are the real the real way you'd wire it up but anyway, we have just got the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip, the UI interface which would basically, when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of IR data which could be decoded by the TV receiver, which obviously means that we are gonna have to conform to whatever whatever form of communication that the TVs are already using, since that is another use, reason to use that infrared because that is what all TVs use at the moment.",1
"Project Manager: what is it called, RSI, what was it that we were talking about?",0
Marketing: The The mute button.,1
"User Interface: And the the, the one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote.",1
User Interface: And if we have a larger public we have yeah more options to sell our product.,0
"Marketing: on top are the basic options on top,",0
Project Manager: But we can go on with the project evaluation.,1
Industrial Designer: I it said something about a sensor but never clarified that.,1
"Industrial Designer: the feel of it, I mean, we have made this out of Play Doh, which is representing the, you know, the rubber, the spongy rubberness.",1
"User Interface: These would be like the rubber, the rubber grips.",1
"Marketing: well what what I really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thb,",0
Industrial Designer: I can look on my.,0
"Industrial Designer: Also because of the cost, not too much buttons on it.",1
Marketing: that was just a very quick passing thought yeah.,0
User Interface: just like o on a sort of side view.,1
"Industrial Designer: That that is the sorta product we are talking about, one that will work for a in a home environment, for a TVs,",1
"Project Manager: but the I would be happy paying over forty for it, I guess, but not much.",0
"User Interface: You can replace your TV with a new TV with internet browsing function,",0
"Project Manager: if you want, I can coordinate, to get some information, you can let me know, so what kind of the details you require, to add this feature in this project.",1
Project Manager: Then the project plan.,1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, 'cause I do not have any material pricing information available to me at the moment, so.",0
"Project Manager: So we said that we have to merge the strong points from our competitors, look at their remote controls.",0
"Marketing: Now we worked through each other,",1
Industrial Designer: Even for colourblind.,1
"Marketing: Or if you are sixty years old, your demands.",0
"User Interface: And I judging from what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that is what we were going after, or the direction we were going in at least.",0
Project Manager: Maybe a little smaller than that.,0
"Project Manager: I s so I suppose one could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out, buy another one.",0
"Project Manager: Yeah, make it a two.",1
Project Manager: We are we are talking about the type of company that we are working for as well.,0
"Industrial Designer: it is very resistant but, you know, something wooden will be like, I do not know high cl so a special high class,",1
User Interface: Otherwise you I do not know whether or not that is.,0
"User Interface: So just keep it simple, make clear buttons, easy to use.",1
User Interface: on the on the LCD I mean although we have done it with a curve it.,0
Project Manager: In thirteen point seven we do have kinetic.,1
"Industrial Designer: Here you have microphone, then it date records your voice, then it try to recognise.",1
"Project Manager: Well, it depends on your walls actually.",1
Industrial Designer: which w 'member the beam was that was an important component of finding the right chip.,1
Marketing: We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black.,1
Project Manager: Evaluation criteria is next in line.,0
Industrial Designer: I'm gonna write that down.,0
"Project Manager: So, it is very much dependant on what you do with your options.",0
"Industrial Designer: But, idea is for to stay in balance with these two with these two.",0
Industrial Designer: New ideas found.,1
"Project Manager: so about this one you were you are dealing with,",0
"Project Manager: Yeah, this that is very good.",0
Marketing: that is totally thrown everything off balance.,0
User Interface: so I thought we would use more or need more buttons than this one.,0
Industrial Designer: I have told about the three first points.,0
"User Interface: We have all these buttons as you can see, but most of them, we just need the ones in the middle.",1
Marketing: We did a pretty nice job until now.,0
Project Manager: here we are again.,0
Industrial Designer: the next slide.,0
Project Manager: So it is more of course this will look like a bone then.,1
Marketing: d make it a special colour then.,0
"Project Manager: The idea of a paging function, a touch screen, face plates.",1
Industrial Designer: Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds.,1
Project Manager: And we made a remote control.,1
"Marketing: Or then again you have a channels, volume, all the stuff, what a.",0
"Project Manager: Yeah you have basically a button menu, which you can use directly, according to the old principle.",1
Industrial Designer: S a bit of a challenge question.,0
"Project Manager: Not to put you on the spot,",0
Project Manager: So I think the costs are within the budget.,1
Project Manager: And now it is up to designing.,0
"User Interface: So if you press system, that is.",0
Project Manager: the important thing here is.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, but what else do we have to cut out? No advanced chip, that is a little bit of problem.",1
"User Interface: Yeah that is that is something which I wanted to ask you also, like what will be the each individually the cost of it.",1
"Project Manager: The parental control will be incorporated, but it must be not too complex.",1
"Industrial Designer: We were we were thinking that normally we'd go for fruity colours, but maybe we are also thinking that your sort of middle aged man, for an example customer, might not want a fruity coloured remote, so m maybe we'd have one version that is a bit toned down,",1
"Project Manager: W You get those ones where you can, if you like, whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep.",1
"Marketing: you Kate, you are exactly right there.",0
"Project Manager: I just have one question, because for the intelligent controller, you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition,",1
"User Interface: But basically these are curved, doublecurved I believe that the tech department, in their in their message to me, that they were referring to the nber of th curves in the bottom.",0
Marketing: That is not the point.,0
User Interface: So let is not use the whiteboard any more.,0
Marketing: Are you gonna do that?.,0
"Industrial Designer: So which then, as I understand it, would probably limit the, limit again the use of certain materials, because they would be too expensive.",1
"Project Manager: Anyways, today three presentations, from every one of you.",0
"Project Manager: which will be used for the television, for the recorder, for the camcorder, all the others, it will become too complex, it will increase the pli the price, we ca not do that.",1
User Interface: So this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have.,0
"User Interface: which is marketed towards children, different designs,",1
"Industrial Designer: But I had too little time,",0
Marketing: But it might be a good idea to make a docking station.,1
"Project Manager: if you press a button that sends a certain transmission through the infrared, whereas I think if we are controlling the LCD we definitely require a much more powerful chip.",1
User Interface: 'Cause I wonder if we put A or B somewhere instead of a number.,0
Industrial Designer: But I think we can we can cut it.,0
Industrial Designer: and then you choose with the with the button to well you navigate.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, if it is standing up it is on there, but also we are gonna have the company name on the front, which is the little black kind of line in the middle.",1
"Project Manager: yeah, that it stands up.",0
Project Manager: Because it is not a very current useful function.,0
"Marketing: We are at two, seven, eight, ten, fifteen point five.",1
Marketing: rather than just bare plastic which they all are at the moment.,1
"Marketing: our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control, something about Videoplus.",1
Industrial Designer: And it should be recyclable.,1
"User Interface: You could you know, you just plug into a power source for a couple of hours, then it is recharged for ages, ages, ages, you do not have to worry with replacing AA batteries,",1
Project Manager: But it is good to keep in mind.,0
User Interface: If we had to include more functions.,0
"Industrial Designer: So it may not be like very expensive, because since we are only focusing on TV remote control.",0
Industrial Designer: because it is very expensive.,0
"Project Manager: And in case if we are we all agree on the fabrica of building of this remote control, we will evaluate the production.",0
Marketing: Like with those words already on it?,0
Project Manager: Maybe it is easy to pick.,0
"Project Manager: So we have no, what is that? So we have forty minutes for this for this second meeting, we have to make sure that we going t that we are sure, that we are,",1
"User Interface: an advanced chip is required to operate the LCD display, it did not say specifically, but I have a hunch that a regular chip is gonna be the scroll wheel, the multiple scroll wheels.",1
"Project Manager: because if somebody actually on the television says, you know, ITV, you are watching BBC then it might change itself,",0
"Marketing: Yeah, yeah, not too flashy.",1
"User Interface: No actually i if i it is like you know it tells you, it can be for two purposes,",0
"Project Manager: So we really need to be sure as to what we can push the cost up to, though we have not got to a stage where we are ready to pin down the price of components.",1
User Interface: For me I think the scroll wheel actually might not be so bad.,1
User Interface: so it is probably gonna be.,0
"User Interface: The yellow button you have is the on off button, so it is really big, hard to miss.",1
"User Interface: But But he also said that we should not only focus on the younger people, but also on the older, will they use it if it only has an LCD screen?",1
"Industrial Designer: With rubber we could sh pretty much shape it the way we wanted it,",0
"Project Manager: Yeah, but it is so.",0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, but it i We do not wanna have a ar an How do you call it? Accu.",0
"User Interface: Yeah, as far as creativity is concerned, yeah I think there was there was room for creativity.",1
"User Interface: you can see on the left, it is got a lot more buttons,",0
Marketing: It is very hard to draw.,0
"Industrial Designer: so I'm wondering, I think we might be able to integrate LCD into our RC.",1
Industrial Designer: a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device.,0
Industrial Designer: but as soon as you click it you go into the menu or some Of you.,0
Marketing: Functional is out.,1
Project Manager: we would just have a TV remote.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, but we can we can do all kinds of As long as it isn is in two D we can use all kind of round shapes.",1
"Marketing: Remote controls, 'cause I had two different things.",1
"Marketing: so in terms of not losing it, do you think that on a scale of one to seven, how easy or hard is it to lose? I'm gonna I'm gonna give it a four, 'cause I think that you can still if it is in between somewhere where you ca not see it, you are kind of not gonna find it,",1
"Marketing: Yeah, but the most easy to use is just with one button.",1
Marketing: I think that Eighteen.,0
Industrial Designer: The basic battery.,1
Project Manager: That would be cool.,1
Marketing: So I think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of fruit fruit themed sleeves.,1
"Project Manager: I'm gonna go ahead, take notes on this too 'cause.",0
User Interface: T the actual thing might be smaller.,1
User Interface: I'd give it a one.,1
"Project Manager: Would the idea something along the lines of, one on button would turn on say the video recorder, the TV, maybe the sound system as well, all in one go, is that kind of.",1
Marketing: So I think it is pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it.,0
Project Manager: let is say it is a pineapple now.,0
Project Manager: P press F five to start it first.,0
User Interface: The field test will tell you how good.,0
Marketing: this so I think i.,0
"Project Manager: And for you, the product evaluation.",1
"Project Manager: And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification, like friendliness, what we just discussed in general.",1
Marketing: Neither was I.,0
Project Manager: here we go.,0
Industrial Designer: so if you are lefthanded you are kind of left scrolling with your finger.,0
"Industrial Designer: or the colours, you could take away s colours for th for the buttons.",1
User Interface: so they kinda just stretch over.,1
"Project Manager: I'm assing that we already have one, but for the purposes of this meeting I, I was not offered a, like a type of logo or colour, so if that could be somewhere on the design so that we can be recognisable.",1
Marketing: Now we have to do the average.,1
Marketing: y you'd maybe need a code word.,1
"Project Manager: well basically what that says, we discuss it,",0
"Project Manager: Now satisfaction with, for example, room for creativity, leadership, teamwork, means, et cetera, whiteboard, digital pens, et cetera.",1
"Marketing: we also asked if w they would, if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control.",1
"Marketing: So we have to decide if we are going to use real hard rubber, or soft rubber.",1
"Industrial Designer: Only one thing that has to be added according to me is the material it is made of, it should be something light.",1
"Industrial Designer: and you might want to add in the report, length, width, height.",0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system, alright.",1
Marketing: I think that is handier.,0
"Project Manager: please copy all the mails, all the discussions to me, so I need to submit to the management.",1
Marketing: We have to be Yeah.,0
"User Interface: we have included a button which is fluorescent green colour, this is the menu button which will control the colour, sharpness, brightness.",0
Marketing: And thirdly the remote would be easy to use.,1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, I think so.",1
Marketing: Well And I think most important factor there is the wooden colour.,1
"Project Manager: because you could have that menu option, sort of.",0
Project Manager: here we are already at our functional design meeting.,0
Marketing: 'Cause we have done all the background work to go for that if they want it.,0
"Marketing: Yeah, the younger people liked soft material.",1
"Marketing: Could I just ask referring back to solar charging, is that compatible with standard batteries?",1
Industrial Designer: and then see how are rates are going.,0
"Project Manager: And, we If you use the LCD, we have to.",1
"Marketing: So, the remote it should have some it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages.",1
"Project Manager: Do we agree on that in principle, like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not.",1
"Project Manager: So our aim is to produce a remote control that is original, trendy, user friendly.",1
Project Manager: You can see there are a few cameras here.,1
"Project Manager: So basically, in order to save our two Euros I was thinking that we could have essentially the same shape, but just have it flattened.",1
"Project Manager: the PowerPoint slide thing said would be good for RSI,",0
"User Interface: I do not know what my favourite animal is,",0
User Interface: That is a good idea.,0
User Interface: So I think they did this in in Charlotte is Web that movie that little well it is actually a book first but at the end all the spiders kinda flew away.,0
"Industrial Designer: Or at the corners, edges, just the edges covered by rubber or something like that.",0
"User Interface: Then, there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television.",1
"Marketing: Basically, I was given an executive smary that was a market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted, then also some fashion watchers in Paris, Milan commented on some things that are gonna be going on this year.",1
Project Manager: There are little.,0
Project Manager: So to appeal a little more to the all the public.,1
"Project Manager: I think it is quite easy to so s zapping, but maybe it will be too fast.",0
"Project Manager: Just spinning, not scrolling, I would say.",1
Marketing: Look something like that.,0
"Project Manager: and the internet is coming in as important, but that they want this remote control to only be for TV with incorporating the corporate image, colour, slogan.",0
"Project Manager: So one hand has the beer, so the other hand.",1
Project Manager: so yeah I guess that is stuff we can think about.,0
"Industrial Designer: Energy source, our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources, your standard battery, solar cells.",1
Project Manager: Right I'm gonna have to.,0
Industrial Designer: And it is got the thing on the inside.,0
"Project Manager: that is good, five minutes, the meeting is over, right on schedule.",0
"Marketing: So you have sleek, stylish, sophisticated, you know, so something that is, you know, a bit cool.",1
Project Manager: Yeah I'm from San Diego as well.,0
"Marketing: But I dunno how much any of this has to do with the fashionable, sort of cool looking thing that we also need to focus on.",1
"Marketing: We can give it a one, because compared to every other remote ever m ever made, this one will be easier to find.",1
"Marketing: me again, Rajan the Marketing Expert.",0
"Project Manager: With the speech recognition, which of course may be changed depending on budget.",1
"Marketing: So th the The detailed ones would be sort of brightness,",1
"Marketing: Well, should we start with just the core, the basic functions that we need.",1
Project Manager: Only four or something.,1
Project Manager: You can just if you ma finish my presentation please.,1
Industrial Designer: You should taste it.,0
"Marketing: next, remote controls are bad for RSI.",1
"Industrial Designer: But unless the controller is gonna consume a lot of batteries, like he is gonna run through like twenty batteries a month,",0
Project Manager: wh when you make a a design ca you can next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price.,1
"Marketing: No, that does not work.",0
Marketing: We have to lower it with six points.,1
"User Interface: I thought so, but maybe with the.",0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, 'cause you you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function.",0
"Industrial Designer: I'm not sure if there is information available on this,",0
Industrial Designer: And well the info on the website which came too late.,1
"Marketing: And this is all over the catwalks, Paris, Milan, I'm talking about clothing, furniture, shoes.",1
"Project Manager: And this design, detailed design meeting we will discuss the lookandfeel of the design, the usability interface design, we will do the product evaluation.",1
Project Manager: Cause that would not be very expensive at all.,0
"User Interface: scroll in the, navigate the menu.",0
"Industrial Designer: about the energy source of the of the device,",0
Industrial Designer: Gotta do what you gotta do.,1
"Project Manager: So maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side, the double R.",1
Marketing: Yeah but this turning can you can you just re explain me the.,0
Industrial Designer: Spongy means it it is like sp.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, I think I think for.",0
Marketing: I'm Marketing Expert.,0
"User Interface: And I'd never heard of the kinetic energy before,",1
Industrial Designer: Shall we have a mute button as well?,1
Project Manager: So first to we have to make a small painting.,1
Project Manager: And that concludes the presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting.,0
"Marketing: So you can see from that, you know, younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software, whereas as people get older, they are a bit more sceptical about it, they are less willing to try it.",1
User Interface: I think it does very well.,1
"Industrial Designer: I think it c should be Well, I'm not sure, I have to ask with manufacturing, but I'm not sure that is what you want, because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel, that is what you get with rubber.",1
Project Manager: So we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions.,1
"Marketing: Forties, because because younger people as younger people have now, sixteen till to twenty five age, are f eighty one percent interested in LCD screen.",1
User Interface: they can be small or round like buttons.,1
Marketing: it is not part of the funky young thing.,0
Marketing: And it is within budget.,0
"Industrial Designer: so we can use even a certain titani is also used in the company to make some space design equipment, so it is kind of it will be probably nicer to use, because it relates to the overall image of the company, but it cannot be used on a double curved surface.",1
"Project Manager: then we need to, by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group is going to be, what the functions of the remote control that is the main goal is to come up with those two things, target group, functions of the remote control.",1
Industrial Designer: Let is wrap it up.,0
Industrial Designer: because it has a LCD screen.,0
"Project Manager: But if we go away with that kind of general specification in mind that we are looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds, we want it to look simple, but still have the buttons so it is easy to use, but only those key buttons, the major buttons, then one sort of menu one, then voice recognition included as an option.",1
"Industrial Designer: But they like soft materials, so we might we have to consider that.",0
Marketing: but that is just a personal opinion.,0
"Industrial Designer: You need a screen with music because you are looking for a specific song, like you know that band or whatever.",0
"Project Manager: Yes, I yes, I think I can.",1
User Interface: We already have our role.,1
"User Interface: You must feel the buttons for volume or whatever, I think.",0
"User Interface: Yeah, the m the means were very good, the means we used.",1
Marketing: So the customer basically is confused.,1
Project Manager: Remote control should only be used for the TV.,1
Project Manager: I'm sure we have that.,0
Marketing: Most people find them ugly.,1
Project Manager: Then that is the end of this meeting.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, but you d you must not forget that our target aim is younger people.",0
Industrial Designer: Because the p the problem I can see with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i for example if.,0
"User Interface: The only advantage I was thinking of to having the buttons, like the buttons on one side for the channel, then the slider is that if you are just holding in your hand, you pick it up, it is easy to n s know, this is just the volume, this is the channel.",1
Project Manager: m but what i so what i but do you think we should.,0
Project Manager: so I have bit of a spreadsheet here for this.,0
Industrial Designer: That is the that is the basic idea.,0
"Project Manager: Any thoughts about buttons or any oth other way of approaching the p the the problem? Or anybody else, strong feelings about remote controls? Are there you know, bad ones they have used or good ones they have used or ones that they have lost, never found again?",1
"Industrial Designer: And they like sports, gaming, that gives them the vitality.",0
Project Manager: Menu button access the menu in the LCD screen.,1
Project Manager: Two point I think I missed two.,0
"Project Manager: Well, theys have to be.",0
User Interface: and we can put all the options into this screen.,1
Project Manager: just in general.,0
Industrial Designer: S so then it depends.,0
"Marketing: These are new ideas we And new shapes, everything.",1
"Industrial Designer: it is a bit different, just a little bit more of a creative feel.",1
"Marketing: So Anyone? And the next one yeah, when it is lost you can find it.",1
"Marketing: Yeah bu but when you say technologically it is more I dunno, in the core, or single.",1
Project Manager: To do that maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on.,0
Industrial Designer: I have colour already.,0
"Industrial Designer: Or a solar battery, although there are slight complications with solar batteries as in we ca not use a latex case if we have a solar battery.",1
Project Manager: So it could either be a two or a one.,0
"Marketing: All n no, that is kinda dependent on the television.",1
Marketing: I think we are better doing something basic like this.,0
"Project Manager: Now we just have to save everything, so.",1
Project Manager: so we will have another meeting in thirty minutes.,0
"Marketing: It is nice, I think.",0
"Industrial Designer: We can use wood, titani.",0
Marketing: I want I want to market it as exclusive.,1
"Industrial Designer: then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel, which was in at the time.",1
User Interface: We were a bit off task.,0
"User Interface: Yeah you could maybe take out the LCD dis display even,",1
User Interface: so you need both of them?,0
"Project Manager: Well, I say three.",1
"Project Manager: What do you mean by the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user, like they have to press the buttons.",1
User Interface: We do not have the slogan though.,0
"User Interface: you can just about make out that the button three buttons are previous track, next track, play pause.",0
"Industrial Designer: from the basic technology point of view, the basic steps that you need in the diagram, in this slide probably works better.",1
User Interface: It is will be embedded there.,0
"Project Manager: just before we go through all of the steps here, well what we will do is.",1
Marketing: we had that in other countries.,0
"Industrial Designer: as for the user interface problem, you know, too many buttons.",0
"User Interface: So it is a bit square, but it is also a bit round.",0
"User Interface: Well, because Well, I I'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing, because I think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit, because what.",1
Project Manager: I mean the shape is trendy.,1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, or s So, we want to have simple, perfect shapes, like I shown in these phones.",1
Marketing: The remote control is beautiful.,1
"Marketing: And the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use,",1
"Marketing: And so with this kind of system or locator or something, to think about, how have people been losing or breaking their remote?",0
"User Interface: I thought maybe, because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another if it was in a ball,",1
"Project Manager: And it is all recorded, woohoo.",0
User Interface: Well you just it is one extra button.,0
"User Interface: And then on the right, it is a lot more simpler, it is got vole, it is got the play the like circle set, which is play, rewind, but it is also what is fastforward is also like next on a menu.",1
Industrial Designer: The user presses a button.,1
"Project Manager: Well no, not you, you can finish your slides before.",0
Industrial Designer: I think it is a two.,0
"Project Manager: Even if it is a jog wheel, it is still repetitive.",0
User Interface: Now our our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button.,1
Industrial Designer: I will go first yeah.,1
"Project Manager: well, now you are all acquainted with the different tools.",0
"Project Manager: if we can look at the criteria you are gonna evaluate, then we will come back to the product evaluation if that is alright.",0
"User Interface: Think it was also realisation of you basically just copy, paste what is given to you into your presentation.",0
"User Interface: Yeah if you do, it w so it would have to be you I mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of, you know, range we need to have on the wheel, So you are either you are you know, th you are either doing this motion to like control the channels or like once you stop that, you know, you can like tap for, different.",1
Industrial Designer: So I'm just going to describe briefly what we do in the remote control.,1
Project Manager: Let is that will make us fifty million Euros.,0
Project Manager: So let is go.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, we are done here.",0
Industrial Designer: Like normal ordinary buttons.,1
"Project Manager: Then we will do the project evaluation, the closing after that.",0
"User Interface: Well, already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick.",1
"Project Manager: So we stick to plastic, it cost nothing.",1
Project Manager: Yeah? Was it a nice way to create your remote control?,0
"Project Manager: So, this one is a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair.",0
Project Manager: so f here is our agenda for today.,0
"Industrial Designer: Well yeah the idea of it was, is that because you close it, you cover the LCD screen, it wo not be vulnerable to scratches or whatever.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah I'm just thinking, if we i we wanna make something different.",1
"User Interface: Our material choices are a plastic latex ty or plastic, a rubber latex type thing, wood, or titani.",1
"Industrial Designer: Like, m switching the LCD display if you want to use LCD, or you do not want you can just use normal button.",0
"User Interface: but we kept we tried to keep it cool,",0
"Industrial Designer: So, that is that summarize well what I have said.",0
"User Interface: So I'm, I u I would find it handy, I think, when you just press one button, you get on six.",1
"Project Manager: So, who are the people you need from the marketing or the technical side or the administration point of view, to add in any documentation, or some technical point of view,",1
Industrial Designer: the single curved in the sixteen.,0
Project Manager: That is the easiest way.,0
"Industrial Designer: Beep or it is a light, maybe it is a light.",0
"Project Manager: I think if you make a good advertisement on television, in the in the guide, you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel.",1
"User Interface: or can it be altered in a certain way, or does the actually user program it, to say a channel means this.",0
User Interface: So these are the things presently which are seen in the market scenarios at present.,0
Marketing: We could check the other remote controls with technical functions.,1
"Industrial Designer: Certain systems already exist, I think.",1
"Industrial Designer: You just say you know, whatever you whatever you want the remote for, you know to change the channel or to turn the TV on, off, you just shout your command to it, it would do it for you if it is within you know, within hearing range.",1
"Marketing: Yeah, I thought about one thing.",0
Industrial Designer: So should we get So are definite Was it thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if has.,1
Industrial Designer: because we have not got a double curved case.,0
Project Manager: Or the th the lowest part of the remote is not changed by the front.,0
"Marketing: you ha you have ten minutes left, I read.",0
Marketing: What do you think? Strawberry sensors.,1
"Marketing: which is contrary to last year, apparently.",0
"Project Manager: Because if it is useful to have it rechargeable,",0
Marketing: Kinetic powered remote control.,1
Project Manager: I will show you the notes again.,0
Marketing: It has to be fancy.,1
"User Interface: It may need more actually, so y you may need to check your battery usage it then you need that, some functionality to indicate the battery limit.",1
Marketing: And so that brings us to my personal preferences.,1
User Interface: But then you are l.,0
"Industrial Designer: shapes should be curved, so round shapes.",1
"Marketing: Yeah, you see I do not some of these things kinda logically follow the others.",0
Industrial Designer: What about the finishing of the case? We have decided we wanted to use the rubber?,0
"Marketing: Yeah, b wide screen, high screen, different things you have,",1
Marketing: they are often lost somewhere in the room.,1
"Project Manager: So, the shapes of the design depends on the LCD, But, it has to be small.",1
"Marketing: And if you put a front on it, there is a hole on the front.",1
Industrial Designer: Here would be the volume.,1
"Industrial Designer: and he came up with the sort of potatoey, mangoey shape, then just went from there really.",0
"User Interface: So those are the basic components that need to go into this, everything else is pretty much open to move around.",0
Industrial Designer: Now And here I have the top of the remote control.,1
"User Interface: I think we should go more to the iPod, MP three players.",1
"Project Manager: So I guess this is the point where we go out of role it looks like, talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity, so forth, how that all worked, I guess.",0
Project Manager: And one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic.,1
"Project Manager: Marketing, the user requirement specification.",1
"User Interface: also had I not been intrigued about the pen, I do not think I woulda used it at all, I did not write barely anything.",1
"Industrial Designer: the line width is too thick, but well.",0
"User Interface: Well, my name is, I looked at technical functions design of the remote.",0
Project Manager: I will take some minutes again.,0
"Marketing: You better bet better keep the LED, the button itself in the same colour I guess.",0
"User Interface: And most of these functions are not going to be used, it creates a rather user unfriendly interface.",1
"Marketing: then maybe a motto, like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign.",1
User Interface: Yeah that is a scroll.,0
"User Interface: well, so we have s broad audience.",0
"Project Manager: because that is what would w you what you would normally do, either call or email someone.",0
Project Manager: I did not knew that.,0
"Industrial Designer: So we have to know that the push button requires a simple chip, but the scroll wheel that kind of higher hightech stuff needs more money which is a higher price range alright.",1
"Marketing: I think sometimes it is just shoved under, under a cushion,",0
Industrial Designer: So I sort of picked battery.,1
"User Interface: And everything being Wait, we have what, sound system, TV, DVD, VHS, TiVo?",0
"Industrial Designer: Well, if it is not chip on print then, I guess, you get different chip components, you build them separately, does not include the infrared.",1
"Industrial Designer: the battery contacts, like normal batteries ca you can put in.",1
"Project Manager: It is kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date, having the button to press for the channel, things like that.",1
Project Manager: Just a beep.,1
"Project Manager: So, no speech recognition? Or.",0
Project Manager: Basic requirements but of the pro of the project.,0
"User Interface: so again you can have a little LCD light somewhere, the flip thing, Have I forgotten anything? I do not think so.",1
Project Manager: I have got one at home.,0
"Project Manager: So we only, we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy.",1
Project Manager: Pray that you do not accidentally lose that piece.,0
"Project Manager: that felt a bit more like a something with order, reason to it than the last one.",0
Project Manager: Well except if we deliver it together with our DVD.,0
"Industrial Designer: They could be plastic, we do not have to have rubber buttons,",1
User Interface: I will just check what it said.,0
User Interface: At least that is what I'm accustomed to.,0
"Marketing: And the slogan, like the actual written slogan, or just to embody the idea of the slogan?",1
Project Manager: Just got an agenda to set out what we are gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting.,0
Project Manager: You can switch between the different drawings.,1
"User Interface: If you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom the base of it, just like yellow with the RR.",1
Project Manager: And Ryan you work on how well they will work with the us with the user.,0
Project Manager: I'm also putting 'em them in the shared folder.,1
Industrial Designer: yeah that is just an estimate though.,0
"Industrial Designer: And so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits, chips, or do you have low level or very expensive, it depends, but I think that low level will be, you know, it is an interim module.",1
Marketing: S I'm just gonna check my email.,0
"Marketing: I think maybe they were I do not know, back in the day when they first came up with remote controls, they had a reason for it being.",0
"Project Manager: Or we have the remote control just go through them until it is like does this do the correct function, such.",0
"Industrial Designer: I just want to have so something to prin to fix my components onto that box, that is it.",0
Industrial Designer: I think so too.,1
Industrial Designer: Well what do they mean with curves again? Because we you have uncurved.,0
"Marketing: And they have 'em in a little box in the middle, this is the consciousness that most people have about replacement remote controls.",0
"Project Manager: I think he can promote the brand value, the product value.",0
"Industrial Designer: I reckon they are sort of, they got it sorted.",0
"Marketing: So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something, will really come into play with a lot of these people.",1
Project Manager: For this meeting.,1
"Industrial Designer: I mean of course it will be evident after a while or if you look at it, it will be evident which way around to point it, since you have the numbers, the, the the buttons, stuff,",0
"Project Manager: yeah, if they under Yeah.",0
Industrial Designer: F for the LCD menu right?,0
"Marketing: because it is much more organic, some would say approachable.",1
Project Manager: Where is my presentation?,0
Project Manager: Depends how much how much movement it really needs.,1
"User Interface: F the form well, we have taken that from the iPod, other popular technical device.",1
Marketing: The speech function is new.,1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, I will give it a one as well.",1
"User Interface: It does not take that much place, also that much It does not cost that much.",0
"Project Manager: And Project Manager will design a better meeting for next time around, be a little bit more prepared.",1
Marketing: Well I have not done math in years.,0
Industrial Designer: how can I get this on the whiteboard?,0
"Project Manager: For example the battery energy source or what if the chip, for whatever reason, breaks down after a certain amount of time, do you just replace it? is there any because it may be in the same area with several other user interfaces, like for DVDs, movies, whatever.",1
"User Interface: It is basically the be standard place for scrollwheel, as far as I know.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, that would be great.",1
"Marketing: I mean I do see the crossover in some sense,",1
Project Manager: so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it.,1
"Industrial Designer: If it is not, then we cannot reach it.",1
Project Manager: He only does it after he is had his dinner.,0
"Project Manager: And I told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext, ignoring everything except the TV, trying to incorporate the corporate colour, slogan.",1
Project Manager: And they do not always talk to each other.,0
"Marketing: so that that is not of any discussion, I think.",0
Industrial Designer: So we have got the plate.,0
"Industrial Designer: and then you have to decide, it is, in a in a way that b is userfriendly.",0
Marketing: seventy five u seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly.,0
"Marketing: And then you know, it it is the right one.",1
User Interface: All the other things can be controlled through the screen.,1
Industrial Designer: And well the Bluetooth chip is just responsible to make the communication between the two devices.,0
Project Manager: That is something we could decide.,0
Marketing: And I could talk to the TV television itself.,1
"Project Manager: That is great, it is very bright as well.",0
Marketing: and maybe we should use colours.,1
Project Manager: But the LCD is easy when you use the scroll buttons.,0
"Project Manager: Because, yeah was very hard to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime,",1
"User Interface: So basically, w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two.",1
Marketing: because with a traditional one you just have one hand.,0
Project Manager: Well I dunno.,0
"User Interface: As we know Google it is a very successful because his powerful function, but with very easy to use user interface.",1
User Interface: here is another example.,0
"Industrial Designer: I have not seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet, just keep that in mind, but these are the options that we have from manufacturing, we can make our case out of plastic, the m the main base will be plastic, but we have all these sort of fashion, technological elements we can add in, wood, latex, titani, rubber or other coloured types of plastic.",1
"Project Manager: Well then we have still the time, so But we do have to come to a decision, right later on.",0
Project Manager: which one is it? Technical functions?,0
Marketing: You can take the SMARTboard.,0
Marketing: scrolling I do not know.,0
Marketing: And besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete.,1
"Industrial Designer: Now our one, I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A batteries but those can be quite bulky so I d I did not know if you wanted to look at something else so we could shrink down the size of the control.",1
Marketing: I think with the marketing element of fruit shaped I mean I that really opened my eyes.,0
"Industrial Designer: are they necessarily buying TV remote controls? Because they probably live in a household that has a TV if they are at the lower end of the age range,",1
Project Manager: I mean do w do we think that the voice technology is fundamental to the project?,0
"Marketing: it is just although it is rubberised, spongy, apart from that we are just going to go for sort of vegetable, fruit colours, we are not gonna try, make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else, like a shell that we discussed,",1
"User Interface: It is not very important,",0
Project Manager: I think if you have a kind of iPod idea.,0
Industrial Designer: You are not holding it like this or something.,0
"Project Manager: An, the marketing strategy, that is very important.",0
Project Manager: Or something like that.,0
"Industrial Designer: So, it was kind of, the whole thing would be removable.",1
"User Interface: I mean maybe design something, that is sort of like suppose not everybody is hand is the same, but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier.",1
Project Manager: Do we do we know by how much?,0
"Industrial Designer: Our manufacturer did not say anything about lithi so we might have to look if we do go that route, we might have to look elsewhere.",1
Project Manager: The waiting is for Sebastian.,0
"Project Manager: And then we will see the financial aspects, the cost of the product.",0
"User Interface: I mean it does not have to be on the flip, it can be on the side somewhere.",1
"Project Manager: And well, what about the idea of automatic on off on the button, yeah.",1
"Marketing: On the other hand, if you do not do it, we can also make a nice bay.",1
"Marketing: And also, this was this year.",1
Project Manager: for now on the schedule are a few points.,0
"Marketing: Not really, I mean not so much, 'cause we do not have the LCD screen, we do not have fancy chip.",1
Project Manager: Half a Euro too much.,1
Project Manager: So all those buttons that ar are to do with teletext screen placing.,0
Industrial Designer: Like if I missed a meeting I could probably get it summed up in like one sentence.,1
"Industrial Designer: The details of the components' design, as you can see there, what we have is the board, main board of the remote control.",1
User Interface: if it if it comes up on the computer itsel on the TV itself.,0
"User Interface: Yeah like certain ones you'd have to limit the fruit selection,",0
Marketing: So that indicates our technological advancement.,0
"Industrial Designer: Most of them, do not they have sort of a combination of the two, like when there is light, they will work off the light,",1
"User Interface: And I think it would be great if you could edit it from, just with a mouse, from where you are sitting.",1
User Interface: I think it is a two.,1
"User Interface: Break it, I do not get.",0
Industrial Designer: I think one of the very interesting things that came up in Ka Kate Cat Cat is presentation was this issue of like voice recognition being more popular with younger people.,0
Industrial Designer: You do not make a remote control of Ah.,0
"Project Manager: Well you need some kind of CPU, I guess.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, m maybe w we we do agree on the thing that the remote should have such a function, if it is possible within the costs, all that kind of things.",1
User Interface: The power button could be like a big apple or something.,1
"Project Manager: teletext is apparently outdated, so due to internet popularity, so that is off the list.",1
Marketing: Little bit lo yeah.,0
"Project Manager: So all in all, I think we have done very well.",0
Marketing: So we we know where we stand.,0
"Project Manager: Gentlemen, I'm afraid we do not have any more time.",1
"Project Manager: We have lunch break, then we have thirty minutes of individual work.",1
Project Manager: Well that is is up to Mister User Interface Designer.,0
"Project Manager: So, we had decided that we are having rubber buttons,",0
Project Manager: You have to draw a favourite animal on the whiteboard.,0
User Interface: But yeah I have a doubt like will it be cost wise effective if we if we design a remote having all the different features for different people or designing three different remotes for three different categories of people.,0
"Project Manager: I always found that really easy when I discovered it,",0
"Marketing: Those things just refer to each of each of us, I think.",1
Project Manager: It looks like you are already on your way for working with the components.,0
Project Manager: But did we decide that the rubbery feel was important enough to us?,0
"User Interface: And that if you push the button the LED gives a light, you see that it is working.",0
"Industrial Designer: there are several components of, the circuit board that we need to consider, where we will be getting them from, what they will be made of.",1
"Industrial Designer: so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be, battery for the energy source, that way you would not have to plug it in, a button pad for input, we can purchase a premade chip which will handle all the processing stuff, IR transmitter to communicate to the TV, that is just sort of standard, so most TVs have an IR receiver.",1
"Project Manager: The same goes for the conceptual design, there will be individual work whic, then discussion afterwards.",1
"Project Manager: And, in closing, 'cause we only have five minutes.",1
"Industrial Designer: Even we can provide many different colours or different fruits,",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah actually we can have one switch to like switch on, on, off, this processor, This really, suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power, volume, this part, this DSPs.",0
"Project Manager: so the f the f the points we had last meeting was the Should be a univ universal remote control No, that is I s I just got a email from the from the personal coach, it should be a TV remote control only.",0
Industrial Designer: It does nothing until of course the key is pressed.,0
"User Interface: No, I just came in.",0
"Project Manager: What we could do, what could be possible, is maybe not an LCD screen but with a preview,",1
"Marketing: It was like, well it was a little pointier than that.",0
"User Interface: It seems like you are gonna have rubber cases, as well as buttons.",1
Project Manager: jogdial for volume.,0
"Marketing: Well Looks very nice, right?",0
"Project Manager: and maybe something like that,",0
Project Manager: welcome to the detailed design meeting.,0
"Industrial Designer: Nah, you'd see it anyway, if you hear it.",0
Industrial Designer: So you wind up your remote control before you use it.,1
"User Interface: but how would you like to implement that, that you say volume up, then it goes up,",1
"Project Manager: Well Ah s Forgot to insert the minutes, but it is about the same thing we discussed before.",0
"User Interface: And this comes with different colours, different shapes.",1
"Project Manager: So, it is just a summary of what we had discussed.",0
Industrial Designer: So you can see.,0
User Interface: The solar cell is too expensive.,1
Project Manager: W that was a nice meeting.,0
"Marketing: So it must be very bright, very colourful.",1
Industrial Designer: I'm not a designer.,0
"Project Manager: So, I guess we are looking at something rather simple.",0
"Project Manager: who sorry, have you have you finished there Andy?",0
"Industrial Designer: the materials we are gonna need to look at the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip, the battery, the in integrated circuit chip works in conjunction with a diode transistor or resonator, two more resistors, a capacitor, the battery works in conjunction with a resistor, a capacitor.",0
User Interface: You should Perhaps you should be able to switch the control off.,0
"Marketing: Are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range, or are we kind of middle to bottom? I do not know.",1
"Industrial Designer: so it is kind of not very intuitive but it is a good technology, I mean once they get used to it.",1
"User Interface: the buttons should be positioned positioned the same way as they are on a, well, conventional remote, I think.",0
Industrial Designer: I ch prefer rubber because it feels Yeah.,0
"Project Manager: So the popularity of the since the popularity of the internet,",1
Industrial Designer: buttons not too small.,0
Project Manager: yeah so des design a new remote control.,0
"User Interface: and if you are looking for teletext you will be searching for half an hour from yeah well, where is it? Where the hell he here I guess, yeah, when you have to use something else.",0
"Marketing: yeah, another thing is the logo is missing still.",1
"User Interface: A special colour, why a special colour?",1
"Industrial Designer: the Industrial Designer will take a look at the working design,",1
Project Manager: Just like the watch from Seiko.,0
"Marketing: So we'd have a special colour, special form, special material on all of them.",1
"User Interface: I having it i having it sort of br bright yellow I think that is quite a good idea, though maybe we could have options for colours as well.",1
Marketing: I ca not just leave it there.,0
"Project Manager: the fi Yeah, the finder function rather than as a speech function to find your remote.",1
"User Interface: which is again maybe having something like a blinking thing, like it could indicate you are it could indicate what is cal like the whether you have enough battery in your in your remote, the blinking.",0
"Project Manager: If it is hidden under the couch but then again you have this wee this wee thing you know that is just a little chip or whatever that has the page button, maybe that could be voice activated too.",1
"Project Manager: So, like I said, we had no insight in finances, no prices,",1
Project Manager: Nine channel switches? Is Yeah.,0
Marketing: Right before the Eur the World Cup.,1
Industrial Designer: And but then I w I would.,0
Marketing: And that is the motto we are referenced to for our our style.,0
"Marketing: If it is a bit like those juggling balls, you can change shape according to your to the way you hold it.",0
Project Manager: Experience with remote control.,1
Industrial Designer: So you will be on the Bahamas.,0
"Industrial Designer: Gotta wonder though, if we are adding so much technology to this one remote, are we still gonna be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty Euro you know goal for selling these things.",1
"Project Manager: I think so, I think so,",0
"Industrial Designer: if we just go with one, it does not go over well then we are in a bad situation.",0
"Marketing: if he has something that works fine, is really fancy, looks nice, it is easy to use, easy to use.",1
Marketing: Does the design fit the group of focus?,0
"Marketing: Or, or like mobile ph.",0
Project Manager: Guillermo you want to?,0
User Interface: Are you going to do that?,0
Industrial Designer: At least that is what I have in.,0
"Marketing: And the old people, old, boring.",1
Project Manager: do we have wait a minute it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls.,1
"User Interface: That actually makes more sense if we are gonna make it so highly customisable, 'cause on the web people can look at the different options they have, see maybe what other people have done, what the range of possibility as,",1
Marketing: And the buttons obviously are rubber.,0
"Marketing: I think it is easier to have it something like a button minus here, plus over here.",1
Industrial Designer: Well i it is it is the shape of the of the remote.,0
Marketing: the next statement.,1
"Project Manager: And, it needs to be userfriendly for, maybe, for an example, for people that, ca not see the nbers as well, or, perhaps an ergonomic design.",1
"Marketing: So it were all positive questions, by by purpose.",1
"User Interface: Just one thing I'm just wondering, the sound signal, from where do you execute th the s sound?",1
Project Manager: Yeah maybe this is important.,0
"Marketing: but you gotta implement it in the TVs, I do not think everyone is gonna buy a Real Reaction TV within a month after the release of our remote control.",0
"Industrial Designer: this is the normal circuit board, like a chip board in a lot of things.",0
User Interface: I mean I th I mean I think to r retaining the s the more sort of biomorphic form in the articulation would gain more in s would gain more profit in sales than it would lose in.,0
"User Interface: so instead we have this is gonna be an LCD screen, just a very basic one, very small with access to the menu through the scroll wheel, confirm button.",1
Marketing: cause we gotta sell this sizzle.,0
"Marketing: But after a while people may wanna return it, because if you have to say som I mean most people use a remote control for switching to channels, they say they do that about ninety eight percent of the time.",1
"Marketing: well like l li like some like some remotes who are out there, which I know, there is one button which is very easy to switch between devices.",1
"Marketing: So, obviously we w I just did a run down the evaluation of the form, the fan the fancy stylishness of the of the unit, the ease of use, speech recognition, cost, we have gone through these.",1
"Marketing: Can can we have multiple designs? Have a modern, have a traditional, have a you know, so instead of them all looking the same, people can have maybe four or five different designs they can choose from.",1
Marketing: tha that is a same step further.,0
"User Interface: I if it is too simple they wo not use the remote control, they use their own th with lot more functions.",0
User Interface: And our motto is we put the fashion in electronics.,0
"User Interface: ma make it two special colours, but we only have one button.",1
User Interface: No the arrow is over here.,0
"Project Manager: having a rechargeable stand, so that not only it doubles as a stand, but for using it as recharging it, but also for using it as sound recognition.",1
"Marketing: But, on the other hand on the other hand, if you have a remote, buy a new TV that is not incorporated in the remote.",1
"Industrial Designer: because, based on what you have go y everybody is saying, right, you want something simple.",1
Marketing: We could totally go for the Japanamation.,1
"Project Manager: Th then you have a ugly, stupid, l ugly looking, dumb remote that noone would buy.",1
Industrial Designer: A button for teletext.,1
Marketing: It is better than it was I guess.,0
"User Interface: well, maybe the on the side.",0
Project Manager: incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer.,1
"User Interface: you know, you want to this gives a protection to the LCD actually, giving a cover to that actually.",1
Marketing: You can find most functions on a TV set.,1
"Marketing: Current remote controls as you know they are the same as this one they are not nice colour, not nice shape, I mean they are all the same, they are not l good looking.",1
Marketing: we will evaluate as to whether we have s done what we set out to do.,0
Marketing: I do not know.,0
Industrial Designer: One more thing is that i.,0
Industrial Designer: Might it might be fine.,0
User Interface: Well then we are gonna put it in.,0
"User Interface: I think I know what you are trying to draw, but it is wrong already.",0
"Industrial Designer: Because we keep all the features, we keep voice recognition, we keep LCD display.",1
"User Interface: I ca not think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote,",0
"Marketing: You can make the underside, you can make it more round, where the LCD is.",1
"Marketing: or like to have everything on one thing,",0
Marketing: Only in English I think.,1
"Project Manager: So, depends on the cost.",1
"Project Manager: Wait, come back.",0
Industrial Designer: and then we could make sure we definitely had all the button supplements.,1
"Industrial Designer: So it says if we make a slightly more fancy, then we lose points innovation, if we make it more innovative, then we lose points on it being fancy, so.",1
"Project Manager: It is what I just said, it is save, print, move back or forward one page.",1
"User Interface: So I so we want to design elegant, easy to use inter interface.",1
"Project Manager: It has relatively few features,",1
Project Manager: Yeah that is one Euro more expensive.,0
Project Manager: Yeah I know.,0
Project Manager: maybe that is if that it is a selling point maybe it has to be the base.,0
"Project Manager: So method of doing this is split up as you can see into the functional design, the conceptional design, the detailed design.",1
"Project Manager: Well then again colours would not be so hard to do, you could have a, you know, a kind of a natural wood colour, like a stained wood, I do not know, olive green or something.",1
Marketing: you could insert the find the lost remote control function in there.,0
Industrial Designer: To the right is volume up.,1
"User Interface: I find them they can be a bit annoying, especially, like you know if I'm watching TV I have to have three separate remote controls of in front of me, you know, one for the TV, one for the digital box, one for m the video recorder as well.",1
Project Manager: but you have to pay extra for the for the possibility of having it in a f a different colour.,0
"Marketing: And what we need an insanely good instruction booklet, because you always have to reconfigure all your contraptions to go with the remote anyways.",0
"Marketing: The triple RC, yeah.",0
"Project Manager: Nah, a lot of people like to have such kind of kind of gay kind of things.",0
"Marketing: I dunno if you know the No Nokia telephone, with the round thing at the bottoms, s something like that.",0
"Project Manager: We put fashion in electronics, we make it work, we put a lot of effort in design, in the product itself.",1
"Project Manager: Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work, we will meet again for the next meeting, in this one want to be more focused on the individual actions the on the components so you will focus on the component concept.",1
User Interface: Well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use.,1
"Project Manager: if you t if you press a button, you can see it,",0
Industrial Designer: well we can use wood.,1
"Marketing: Yeah, n no, we just want it to be a finder.",0
Project Manager: Because of the lights on the bottom of it.,0
Marketing: Was there anything else there that we in the new project requirements?,0
"Marketing: They get lost a lot, s as it came up in our last meeting.",1
"Project Manager: So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button, you know, like on, off, do not make a lot of special put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or.",1
"Project Manager: We were thinking a shell, but something along those lines, just a different shape from what is normal.",1
"Project Manager: And the key issue here is, is being trendy, original.",1
"Project Manager: I'm Rose, I'm Project Manager, from California.",0
"Project Manager: So the functional design is to identify the main user needs, the technical function the remote control should fulfil.",1
"User Interface: I think we should, if it is possible, one with colours, but.",1
"Marketing: So as you see it first have to be very nice, s something that people are proud of that i they can be id identified with, then something that contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends, h, mine has this, not yours.",0
"Project Manager: although the whole concepts thing, the whole concepts phase, I do not think I really understood like the concept.",1
Marketing: Do you think it is easy to use?,1
Project Manager: We can decide the next meeting.,0
Project Manager: what is my favourite animal?,1
Project Manager: Just as a test.,1
Industrial Designer: Like say just the underside or so then it can be done.,0
"Project Manager: We should include speech synthesis in this case, no?",1
User Interface: So probably plastic or something.,1
Marketing: we are still not making it easier then.,0
"User Interface: So we can s we can skip the display,",1
"Project Manager: 'Specially old people, maybe bi bigger buttons or something, I dunno.",1
Marketing: They are less interested in new features.,0
"User Interface: And th the one or two things you have to draw when you are there, just use a flipboard.",0
"User Interface: Yeah, then you paint it in the colour you want it.",0
"Industrial Designer: and for the buttons, it can have the scroll wheel which they use in mouses for com PCs.",1
"Marketing: No, no way.",0
"Project Manager: we are here at the conceptual design meeting, which is hereby opened.",1
"Marketing: So that, that is a whole other field of research.",0
"User Interface: You want to change tracks, you want to adjust volume.",0
"Marketing: so you could, so your thumb would be easily.",1
"User Interface: so most remote controls use graphical interface, where you have got s buttons, you point it rather than having the output as a stream of text or something.",1
User Interface: Well it is quite a long phrase.,0
Project Manager: Experience with a remote control.,1
User Interface: I personally think there should be a big difference between between something.,0
"User Interface: no, you can just say the c.",0
"Industrial Designer: as for the energy source, you know, almost every remote control uses just batteries, but we do not have to be limited by that.",1
Project Manager: so one of those.,0
"Industrial Designer: So I was just working off the top of my head, using my colin common knowledge about remote controls.",0
"Project Manager: Way too much I think for our goal,",0
"Project Manager: Yeah, that is voice recognition, so.",0
User Interface: That is enough.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, I do not understand.",0
"Marketing: I mean on the LCD, according to what I understand from your model is, you have a joystick here, you have LCD, you just press your joystick, you get here a programme.",1
Industrial Designer: it has a consistency of those stress balls.,1
"User Interface: And well one of the ideas was maybe use touch screen, but s I do not know in how far that is possible,",0
"Project Manager: Or maybe you should guess what I'm drawing, eh.",1
Project Manager: I took that out.,0
"Project Manager: I do not know what, new ideas found, means, to be honest.",0
"Marketing: Yeah, but it also has a place,",0
"Marketing: If you slide it open, it lights up.",1
Project Manager: And at the end of the day we have a final meeting.,1
Industrial Designer: Just the web page provided.,1
Marketing: we have twenty five minutes for the meeting.,1
"Industrial Designer: Red, green are actually the b the easiest to discriminate.",0
"Marketing: And then you have the option of having the different colours, different covers.",1
Industrial Designer: That is right.,0
"Industrial Designer: So, as we discussed before, we need to we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control.",1
"Project Manager: we have got the video, now there is I ca not remember what it is called, the little code at the end of programme details,",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, but it is under or equal.",0
Project Manager: And with a scrolling function also.,0
Marketing: That A very small amount.,0
Industrial Designer: Everything else in plastic or even titanium if we want to use it.,1
"Industrial Designer: That is it speaks for itself,",0
Marketing: Y look at look at the frequency.,0
Industrial Designer: That is a short h how it works.,0
Industrial Designer: We could have talked about doing a windup or a dynamo or a solar power.,0
Project Manager: That is for you.,0
User Interface: And then we can get a docking station.,0
"Industrial Designer: And the second thing, f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is there are two buttons for volume control.",1
Project Manager: I think the channel button should be in the centre.,1
Marketing: And the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological innovative.,0
"User Interface: Maybe not less, but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort,",1
"Project Manager: So, do we have other concepts? Then for the components, we use a normal battery.",1
"Project Manager: So the thing we have to know is you already know what we are going to do, you also read what this the things or, not yet,",0
User Interface: Its the best remote ever.,0
User Interface: We should go with that concept I think.,0
"Project Manager: Your individual action, you can find them in the email.",1
"Project Manager: And it also operates on infrared, so you have to got the little device inside your room, then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor.",1
User Interface: apart from that it is gonna be used as a confirm button for the LCD screen.,1
"User Interface: And also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing, they have got too many buttons on them too sort of too sort of complicated when all I really wanna do is switch on, off, change the channel, change the volume.",1
"Marketing: I'm thinking of early adopters, because they use new technology first,",0
"Industrial Designer: But I think the pen is v is very intuitive, everybody knows how to use it, we do not have to worry.",1
User Interface: but then you have still the images on the rubber of the case.,0
Project Manager: now this does not necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the t to the market.,0
"Industrial Designer: but who said who said we were,",0
Industrial Designer: People can change it every month.,0
Industrial Designer: When you look at the remote controller it is it this is a normal remote controller.,1
"User Interface: Is it everybody is going to evaluate, or just the Market.",1
Marketing: but we have to take this into account.,1
Industrial Designer: You can make it larger to to with accompanying greater fields to push the button.,0
Industrial Designer: basically w yeah we designed the two items.,0
"Industrial Designer: So there are flats, there are single curve, there are double curves.",0
"User Interface: Do you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside, then a kind of spongy Yeah, s thick spongy cover,",1
User Interface: Voice recognition is quite tough.,0
"Marketing: You have to go back, find another one.",0
"User Interface: Another remote control, slightly different, it is a simpler remote control many less buttons but has many fewer functions, m much easier for the user to manipulate, use.",1
User Interface: Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to.,0
Project Manager: But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit.,1
Marketing: to to eep it simple when you disfmarer.,0
Industrial Designer: I think one that works would be good.,1
"User Interface: But what I'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny look fancy, not funny.",1
User Interface: I mean the whole point of user evaluation is to see what real people need.,1
"Marketing: Most of fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room, people are always searching for them rather than watching the TV.",0
"Industrial Designer: We want to have a no, I do not know if this is a good idea.",0
"Marketing: I have For a remote control, I think it is.",1
"Industrial Designer: So I in fact the f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use,",1
"Project Manager: And our slogan pasted somewhere on it, on the bottom.",1
"Marketing: The lowest rating we have got, which is really n it is not terribly low, i it is close around neutral is for the minimisation of repetitive strain injury.",0
"User Interface: And so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic,",1
User Interface: the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set.,1
"Industrial Designer: But pictures of fruit, vegetables.",1
Project Manager: then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us.,1
"Marketing: Thirteen, twenty, twenty six point five, seven, thirty two, thirty six.",1
User Interface: But I presume that the functions must come up on the TV screen.,1
"Marketing: I realise now, because spongelike material is dropped.",1
"User Interface: Then there should d there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour, colour of the picture, the contrast, sharpness, brightness of the picture.",1
Project Manager: We will not use teletext.,0
"Marketing: as long as there is something big in the middle, because like the old phones, there is like that just like piece of metal or like a picture or something in the middle.",0
"User Interface: But still, you had that as well.",0
Marketing: To customise your own remote control.,1
"Project Manager: But if you have carpets on the wall, which our natural loving friends probably do have, then yeah, th it might be a bit more of a issue.",0
Industrial Designer: So we drop the voice recognition?,0
"Project Manager: So I'm very much open to suggestions of where we go, but because we need to shed what was four Euros off of the the price of for what we really desired, this one comes in under price as you can see, but this was the one that sacrificed the material for the case, for the actual case design.",1
"Industrial Designer: and, you know, it might be out by the swimming pool or something like that.",0
User Interface: So I guess we could have a menu button as well.,0
"User Interface: commands, mechanisms, that basically user uses to control the operator operating system.",1
Marketing: You guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria.,1
User Interface: So what the concept is to have a fliptop model.,1
Industrial Designer: then we use m must use the second most expensive chip.,1
"Project Manager: Yeah, maybe it can work with show view.",0
Industrial Designer: I'm gonna give it a two.,1
User Interface: This is my suggested design.,1
"User Interface: And there is one other feature that we were debating, but we decided to go against it, is you could.",1
"User Interface: A actually it depends, it depends what kind of functionalities you want to add into it,",1
"Project Manager: The materials well should be hard plastic with rubber from, well the labelling of the buttons should be indestructible.",0
Marketing: But since we just have to.,1
"Project Manager: So, what they say on the side is put fashion there.",1
"Marketing: I should be able to actually, if I email it to you now.",1
User Interface: There we are.,0
"User Interface: Yeah the only problem there might be which know, i if it is very sensitive,",1
User Interface: the plus is only for if you are going past the number nine.,0
Marketing: You can ask some questions or something.,0
"Industrial Designer: it depend if it is depends who who is using it, who is just sitting there clicking,",0
"User Interface: Maybe not even all of it 'cause we said colours, fashion w were important so maybe just like a little l line that is kind of around the outside, then you can make the rest a different colour.",0
Marketing: it is d it is definitely more fancier than that one.,0
Project Manager: So see you in thirty minutes.,1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, I actually did.",0
Industrial Designer: No it is not a mouse.,1
Marketing: there you go.,0
"User Interface: So let is say an average size,",0
"User Interface: in the concept design, the user interface, how the user reacts with the product.",0
Project Manager: There we go.,1
"User Interface: Maybe we have so suggested this twopart thing, where if it was to have a speech recognition thing, you could maybe control that on the do it or program all that on the control bit.",1
User Interface: I mean I think we worked well together.,0
"Marketing: could it be hard, then something around it?",1
User Interface: I think they like the speech.,1
"Project Manager: Yeah you can choose this, drop these, then we have a half Euro left.",0
"Project Manager: Yeah, that was the eyes.",0
"Project Manager: So maybe this is better, to send it by email.?",0
"Industrial Designer: It is a nice chorus, yeah.",0
Marketing: The device is easy to find if you lose it?,0
Industrial Designer: Is it if I try? Is that with you?,0
"Marketing: But then you ring 'em, you find them.",0
Project Manager: The selling price of our remote control is gonna be twenty five Euros.,1
Project Manager: due to some technical problems I have not digitized the last the meeting minutes.,0
"Industrial Designer: Something like the case, if it is scratched or something, you would want to reuse it, but you might be able to melt it down, reuse it again somewhere else.",0
"Marketing: because I think one of the things that being somewhat computer literate, we tend to go to menus, then make choices, you know, so if it is like an vole button, you know, you can go in, say mute or vole.",1
Project Manager: so these are the sort of three extra parameters that have been put on this project.,0
"User Interface: We can give them smooth keys, you know.",1
Industrial Designer: Next to the control on the left.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, but Yeah, if we want to make it kind of, yeah, new.",1
User Interface: Most things in modern TVs are also on the menu.,1
"Project Manager: And if anything you need anytime so please either you can call me, or just send me email, or just come, knock my door, so I'm available here.",1
"Industrial Designer: And the design, it should differ.",1
"User Interface: Maybe we ought to reconsider everything with this, yeah.",1
"Marketing: yeah, w what they want wanted was colours, soft materials.",0
Industrial Designer: We do want to reach twelve point five.,0
Project Manager: Only what happened to the single curve we spoke about last meeting?,0
"User Interface: simple designs, like the last one we just saw, not too many buttons, as Raj pointed out, only ten percent fifty percent of people only use ten percent of the buttons,",0
"Project Manager: and also the remote control will only be used for television, so for y for you your designing, you are not you wo not be you wo not had buttons to just to manipulate yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that.",1
"Industrial Designer: And it is twelve Euros, I think.",0
"User Interface: Yeah, basically, as far as methods, I was I was looking at looking at already existing remotes, trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there.",1
User Interface: I think the young people are th are.,0
Project Manager: I'd use an remote control.,0
"Marketing: Yeah, that is right.",0
"Industrial Designer: deciding between the kinetic power or the speech recognition, if we had either of those for our budget, they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition.",1
User Interface: We used those.,0
User Interface: So my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look.,1
"Project Manager: N well, if you have to look at it.",0
"Industrial Designer: So when you add speech recognition to your remote control, it is very easy to change the channel.",0
Project Manager: Well exce except for the surfing shape.,1
"Marketing: No because I this is this is years ago in the United States where we are driving down, he said call home, the telephone called immediately.",0
"Project Manager: We decided it was important to reflect the company is image in our product, we put fashion in electronics, you know that kind of s thing.",1
User Interface: So you got how many degree you it.,0
"User Interface: Not too full, like Jens already said, only ten percent is being used.",1
Industrial Designer: A little later but here it is.,0
"User Interface: Do not know if that is got a name,",0
"User Interface: Regular chip, because we do not have special functions to use in advanced chip, for example.",0
"Marketing: so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell, a variety of designs,",1
Industrial Designer: Like roller for the Yeah.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so,",1
"User Interface: This one has no obvious connections to fruit, but because it is round, molded, it kinda makes you think sort of organic, touchyfeely, kiddie, it is more like yeah, you'd expect it to be like a child is sorta toy remote control instead of a real one, which I quite like that sort of image.",1
User Interface: what was with the chip on print?,1
Marketing: Reduce the number of unused buttons.,1
"User Interface: and so I think it is is best when they are clearly labelled, you can see which buttons you are supposed to use, you know.",0
"Project Manager: Usabili Yeah ease of use will be a lot more difficult,",1
"Project Manager: But whether or not our clients are willing to pay twenty five Euros for this kind of device is doub is well, is not sure.",1
"Industrial Designer: buttons, for buttons we have pushbuttons, which is what Real Reaction uses the most often, but we also have scror scroll wheels,",1
Project Manager: Then we have thirteen Euros.,1
Industrial Designer: but that is not what has been asked.,0
User Interface: Now the we decided upon including certain features on our remote.,0
"Project Manager: as everybody will have to use it,",0
"User Interface: Yeah, I think it is because this technology is for limited wor or limited wor lexical recognition, it is very.",0
"Industrial Designer: They, well, they like more the they like the traditional materials, like wood, such more.",1
User Interface: At least it is environmentally friendly.,0
Project Manager: Everybody found his place again? Yeah?,0
User Interface: Remember the management said that it had to be prominent.,0
"User Interface: It is quite a standard one, but it is not from a TV, it is from a much easier device like air conditioning or something.",0
Marketing: Yeah we want to incorporate in into it.,0
Project Manager: First thing is we talked about knowledge management.,0
Industrial Designer: Let is say that we can do something like that.,1
"Industrial Designer: So I think I missed the budget thing,",0
Project Manager: This thing we are gonna design is a new remote control.,0
Project Manager: So the selling price of the product will be twenty five Euros.,1
"Marketing: They really want to have something good, having a good design in their hands,",1
"Marketing: So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important, but it is third in order of preference for the subject group we looked at.",0
User Interface: And then on the side you have the buttons.,1
"Marketing: And in my research this year I found out that fruit, vegetable shapes are really popular.",0
Marketing: So it meets I think it meets more the young people than the older people.,1
"Marketing: After that five minutes, you have ten minutes to finish it, or.",0
"Project Manager: Because, this is, this is one.",0
User Interface: That was sort of the inspiration for it.,0
"User Interface: Should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include,",1
"Project Manager: so we could do like the pink range, the blue range, the green range, the.",1
"Industrial Designer: It is kind of handshaking, when starting to when you start to communicate with the your TV then it is like an handshaking protocol with your remote.",0
"Project Manager: so not too much teletext support, but in a separate menu,",1
Project Manager: you want to go?,0
"User Interface: Yeah, we should u.",0
"Industrial Designer: So we need the expensive, most expensive chip, if we use an LCD.",1
Project Manager: That is for the LCD or for the titanium?,1
Project Manager: Between four or five.,1
"Industrial Designer: We figured it could stand up like this on your table, if you wanted it to, if I made the bot the bottom flat.",1
Project Manager: Capture we do not have to do anything with.,0
"Marketing: It says menu,",1
"Marketing: I would think so, because you'd have to develop a base.",0
Project Manager: But people could have anything that they wanted.,0
"Project Manager: many functions, very easy to use.",1
"User Interface: Yeah, but not for each button one LED, I think.",1
"Marketing: Elderly p el elderly, young people, so.",1
Marketing: I think especially for the older generation.,0
Project Manager: This is a meeting on functional design.,1
Project Manager: And we will once again have Poppy as our first presenter.,0
"Project Manager: So so that mean w we need an in an extra internet connection to use the remote control, if you want to browse, in addition to the TV, or or it should be a special TV connected to.",1
Project Manager: And you can always find your remote control up.,0
User Interface: Like how often do you hit nine?,0
Project Manager: so shall we make the decision to include speech recognition.,0
"Industrial Designer: We are not absolutely sure about a combination of the two, but it can be either of those.",0
Marketing: It is a bicycle mechanism.,0
Project Manager: I do not think it is very interesting.,0
"Marketing: And we have to keep in mind the, the reliability of our research.",0
Industrial Designer: It is under or equal.,0
"User Interface: but I have never seen anything, none of my examples were was like this, actually, so.",0
Project Manager: What is chip on print? What is.,0
"Project Manager: I do not know that we are that innovative, to tell you the truth.",1
Project Manager: How t now the meeting actually we gathering here to discuss about the functional design meeting.,1
"Marketing: Hi, me Raj, again.",0
Industrial Designer: So that is probably a.,0
"Industrial Designer: And the bleep signal, y you told us.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah I'm somewhere, but maybe you can help me.",1
Marketing: Should I plug that in?,0
Project Manager: That can come under Arlo as well.,0
"Project Manager: Yes, it basically is the same shape.",0
Industrial Designer: We do not have LCD for it but that we decided we do not want to have.,0
"Industrial Designer: If we can do with away with that, our product can be really popular in the sense that a person can say, I want to watch ITV one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five.",1
Industrial Designer: And that is about it.,0
"User Interface: So maybe make one one button, one navigation button.",0
"Project Manager: Just simply create a new one, start all over because we want to save all the results.",1
"Industrial Designer: For the first time, well it was hard to get the h the actual labelling on the individual buttons.",1
Project Manager: Here is a simple tool bar.,1
Project Manager: I like that.,0
"Industrial Designer: Me too a two, because only the battery is not techin technologically high standard.",1
Project Manager: Cos it would be costly also it would take more time to develop to have a general generic remote control.,0
Project Manager: I think it th w we are talking the functional design is more your area of things where you will be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control.,0
User Interface: I think we just say that it was gonna be the most basic stuff possible.,0
Project Manager: I do not like snakes.,0
"Marketing: you can make a double feature l like a button on the top, under it.",0
Industrial Designer: but could be very difficult to get the specific design.,0
"Project Manager: The Industrial Designer, what does that stand for, ID,",1
Marketing: These are seven factors times seven is forty something.,1
"User Interface: basi basically what I basically what the what be having, I would say, the whole thing articulated at two points, so that if you if you are handing it from a lef left or right handed user you can adjust it so that the the LC the LCD, the The joystick would be in the right place.",1
"Project Manager: There should be extra features like lid buttons, maybe a beep.",0
Project Manager: I Di did you save this one in the folder?,0
"Industrial Designer: I think perhaps that age group is significant as well because those are people who use the computer,",0
Industrial Designer: I did not have a phone 'til university.,0
"Project Manager: couple main ones being like, I dunno, lemons or strawberries or something.",1
Project Manager: Take it down to just a scroll wheel.,1
"Project Manager: Forty no sorry for forty five to fifty five age group, to put myself right in the middle of it, u use remote controls to a great extent.",1
"User Interface: They have done research about it, even more possibilities now with speech.",0
User Interface: so the user interface will consist of two parts.,1
"Project Manager: So we have also to focus more on the internet aspects because well te teletext is outdated now, finally, it should be clear that the corporate image, that means colours, logos of the co our company should be clearly inde identified in the product.",1
"Project Manager: Well that is right, I do not I do not even know whether the I do not even know whether the s the signal lasts as long as you actually keep the button pressed,",0
Project Manager: or can we go to the next presentation?,0
"Marketing: that is not very good, because I thought about television, DVD player, stereo, VCR.",1
Project Manager: but I still want one.,0
Marketing: I think th I think the options buttons are not the easiest way to.,0
"Marketing: Yeah? That you can press it, then it comes up? Or.",0
Project Manager: And what is that supposed to be?,0
"Project Manager: but you can write things, of course you can also, when you click here, erase things, so we have est left.",1
"User Interface: Well I'm Mike, User Interface Designer.",1
"Marketing: Because if you have a screen on it, you wanna look at your screen.",0
"Project Manager: Maybe it is still a good idea, I'm not sure.",1
"Marketing: This is interesting, 'cause I think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important, but maybe what is innovative is having it simple with with technologically superior fabrics or, you know, designed in interesting substances.",1
Project Manager: if we are gonna have to.,0
Marketing: Remote control is got a basic design intended for novice users.,0
Marketing: Ma it is maybe it is not on the network of the rest.,0
"Marketing: Inspired by the latest interior, clothing fashion.",0
"Project Manager: I guess we will a that is gonna be a thing, if we run a bit overbudget, that might be.",1
Project Manager: And here are the individual actions for the for the other roles.,1
"Marketing: Nine?, minus one.",0
Marketing: So maybe having buttons be various shapes might be a help too.,0
"User Interface: I think yeah, I think a scroll wheel would be nice, but it is not necessary.",1
"Industrial Designer: if you want the buttons to be yeah, if you have a double curve control, it is rubber, then you have these rubber buttons as well.",1
Marketing: most of the time you have one button in the middle.,1
Project Manager: We have the adva advanced.,1
Project Manager: It seemed like everything flowed pretty logically.,1
"Marketing: I think with only one menu, four button, channel, volume, it should also be enough for easy to use.",1
User Interface: The most there are only seven buttons.,1
"Project Manager: And you can program I think eight different devices in it, you can use it for your television, anything else.",0
"Marketing: and then if you want to mess about with it, you flip it open,",0
Marketing: I want to open the my s no.,0
"Project Manager: I know, b but there should be an adapter as well.",0
Industrial Designer: And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser.,1
"Project Manager: I think we'd be yeah, no, it'd be more a case of how do we envisage us performing the product evaluation once we have a model to test with.",0
"Industrial Designer: Pricing is a factor for us, that is why we will go for the regular chip.",1
"Marketing: Is it possible, just as an option, when we open it up, people can use their fingers to press the button, or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to.",1
Project Manager: Well I think they should in an in an isolated part of the remote.,0
"User Interface: The next one? So I come up with a simple design, just keep the v navigation buttons.",1
"User Interface: You know, something like that.",1
"Marketing: and four of the buttons are in the wheel, the other one is the little bit inside the wheel,",0
Marketing: and then you have got a flag s Very big RC.,0
"Project Manager: And I have red hair, so must be red.",0
Marketing: It is just extra.,0
Project Manager: It will be too much as well.,0
"Marketing: Up the numbers, or the up down?",0
"User Interface: and they were selling something like a hundred Euros, two hundred Euros.",0
Project Manager: The financial aspect were.,0
"User Interface: So it does not really look like a dolphin,",0
Project Manager: it is definitely for make it glow in the dark even better.,1
"Industrial Designer: And also, my drawing skill is not that great so, yeah.",0
"Marketing: one remote, but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one.",1
"Marketing: Also, considering that the d research b has been carried out by Real Reaction, I'm a little hesitant as to like, how these questions may have been worded, if necessarily this whole fashion to technology y edas ease of use is necessarily the right ranking.",1
"User Interface: Yeah, I tho I think that is not usable.",0
"Marketing: And to come back on the swapping things, I do not think, I I think the younger will be most interest in it.",1
Project Manager: What is it m is that the speaker we were t I do not know what it is.,0
Marketing: And the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative.,1
"Marketing: Yeah, that is a good plan.",0
Project Manager: we also had the kid is remote for a simple idea.,0
Project Manager: So just you push the button.,0
"Marketing: Well from the mouse idea you could, remote is a piece of plastic with the big rubber buttons sticking out of it which you press, whereas if you want could all be flat, the buttons are very kind of almost subtle that instead of being raised out of the device you push into device you see, like a mouse button.",1
User Interface: There is a final questionnaire.,0
"Marketing: But if a person does not like banana, or orange, you are limiting him.",1
Industrial Designer: so it is a two.,0
Marketing: Do you know? 'Cause you do not tend to get flat vegetables.,1
Marketing: It it have to work only when you use it.,0
Project Manager: Well that was what I had to say.,0
"Marketing: and users do not really need all of the buttons that are contained on there, because they only use ten percent of the buttons really.",1
"Marketing: I know personally that would be a very attractive feature, is to have a have a button I can push to find my remote control.",1
"Project Manager: m maybe maybe we can give the the the case a very normal a v very normal case but, with the changeable covers to fancy it up.",1
"Marketing: Or we can do something, we can design two three shapes, we can have a public survey, let the public choose what they want.",1
"Industrial Designer: It could be a battery, like rechargeable probably.",1
Marketing: It needs to be compatible 'cause universal remote controls are never universal.,1
"Marketing: I'm not so happy about the fruit shape, you know.",1
User Interface: No you just tap I think.,1
"Marketing: Sure, can I get the.",0
"Industrial Designer: So the components that we find here are the energy source, you know the battery or whatever that is gonna m make it work, then the chip, which converts the data, the user that is controlling the chip, the infrared bulb that is gonna let us move the data to the receiver.",1
"Project Manager: then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan, we will have a discussion.",0
Project Manager: Not too many discussions.,1
"Project Manager: so first of all energy source, we picked battery.",0
"User Interface: You need to browse the browse the channels in upward downward way,",1
"Industrial Designer: The user interface restrictions basically means that if you use more complicated features, like the buttons are standard, the LCD panel, the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic.",1
Industrial Designer: when I saw your d.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, you y that is a fun that is not the function of the controller, that is a function of TV.",0
"Project Manager: No, you do not think so?",0
"Marketing: And there is no reason we need to make it look as fashionable, stylish as a mobile phone, it can still be lightweight plastic, you know?",1
"User Interface: The advantages of working with plastic, rubber is w we we will have a lot more options just in terms of shape.",0
"Project Manager: So perhaps some sort of menubased thing, or.",1
User Interface: the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of a remote control.,0
"User Interface: Yeah but m but on the other hand, remote control is not as close to you probably might just speak into it.",1
"User Interface: That we can what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off TV button, the off button, the remote there be s instruction on the screen, please charge me.",1
User Interface: It would have to be a bit bigger.,1
"Industrial Designer: And g big buttons, m that is easier to use than I think.",0
Industrial Designer: Well what I found was that a senior.,0
"User Interface: if the technical functions have to be designed, I I have gotta know for what kind of machines they will be.",1
Marketing: And what I keep throwing out there I just keep throwing out ideas to try to make this thing look or act or in some way identify itself as unique or different.,1
"Project Manager: You have heard that already I think, so.",0
Marketing: Not just in electronic fashion.,1
"Project Manager: this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes, so we should keep that in mind.",0
User Interface: Is there some formula you are using that says you have to sum them up?,0
"User Interface: Like you could say good morning remote control, it will say in a sexy female voice, Good morning Joe.",1
Project Manager: the tool training.,1
Project Manager: So I'm just gonna pop this in here 'cause I have a slide about decision making which I'd forgotten about.,0
"Marketing: Only thing you have to do is wipe the screen off once each time, to get all the fingerprints off it.",1
"Marketing: So, that is that.",0
"User Interface: it would make the whole thing a lot lighter, more convenient.",1
Marketing: But let is forget about it.,0
User Interface: Something like that.,0
"Marketing: If we want to have that option, you press that button in the remote.",1
"User Interface: And the shape, there is two basic shape.",1
"Industrial Designer: Just which maybe from an engineering point this could be holding the batteries, so on.",0
Marketing: We could now if that'd make up for it.,0
"User Interface: I mean I'm just thinking maybe if it was circular with the sort of that sort of the sort of early idea we had, with the way that was more like that, whereas this is just a onehanded thing that you sort of almost wrap round the thb.",1
Marketing: Get the good points try to merge them into one universal remote control.,0
Project Manager: And everything that is left is the basic function that that we want our product to have.,0
User Interface: So you c you ca not put a lot of functions in one Yeah.,0
Marketing: So you can always have a lot of fun with a dog.,0
"Marketing: and I feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints, does not really matter.",1
"Project Manager: I suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down, which I will do.",1
Project Manager: but that would p that would probably be quite expensive.,1
"Marketing: and big like buttons that sort of like, like on a blender or something.",0
Industrial Designer: It is really funny that you got spam in your work emails.,0
Project Manager: That are the functions.,1
User Interface: then at the bottom we have our logo.,0
"Project Manager: So, special colour, you want three in there.",1
"Industrial Designer: for the energy source we can use a basic battery or, a as an optional thing, a kinetic energy, like in a watch, which you just shake, it produces energy.",1
"Industrial Designer: No, it is only when you use pushbuttons, it will cost that much.",1
Industrial Designer: I s because i in my presentation I do not have here with.,0
"User Interface: You could change the vegetable, or fruit.",1
"Industrial Designer: And I I'm thinking you know a drawing palette, where you have the shape for your thumb.",1
Marketing: We do we do got a market.,0
Industrial Designer: I'm the Industrial Designer for this project.,1
Industrial Designer: There are three components three components type.,0
"Marketing: The other thing is, is the left hand one protruding?",1
"User Interface: where, you know, you have a variety of colours, that people feel like they are customising it when they buy it, even, you know, just by the fact of choosing.",1
Industrial Designer: Well A coffee grind does not have Na ja.,0
"Project Manager: Well, satisfaction on for example, are we satisfactory about our creativity?",0
"Marketing: all the settings, about audio settings, video settings, channel settings, which are not very often used, we could group them on one button, make them accessible in one menu button or whatever, because they are used very rarely, well, it there are a lot of options there, so we can really make yeah, how do you say, we can spare at buttons over there.",1
"Industrial Designer: And designing, looking at the chips, the solar cells, it was very informative for.",1
User Interface: And it means that th children have a novelty of having their own remote control.,0
"Industrial Designer: Do we want a scroll wheel, or do we just want pushbuttons?",1
Marketing: I think it is cool but there are definitely some considerations.,0
Marketing: We are gonna do it all together so we evaluate each criteria.,1
"User Interface: There is on, off, vole, channel, skip to certain channels with the nbers.",0
Industrial Designer: They sh Those should be on top.,1
User Interface: I do not think it is practical at all.,0
"Project Manager: we decided upon a universal control, one handset for all, TV, video equipment.",1
"Project Manager: I'm not sure, you should find out if it is if rechargeable is important.",0
"User Interface: And, well, we began with with a form of shape, that is is easy to hold w in one hand, left or right handed.",1
"Industrial Designer: right, so you want an animal, the characteristics of that animal.",0
"Industrial Designer: I think plastic, rubber would be fine, but plastic, rubber, wood, I was not I'm not very sure about the titanium.",0
Project Manager: You want to dump the titanium?,0
"Project Manager: Which is good as, as we have sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway.",1
Marketing: I'm trying to streamline mine a little bit.,0
Marketing: We do not wanna outsmart.,0
Project Manager: You can use this pen by holding it like a like a little child.,1
"Project Manager: So, you can see there that the If you want to keep kinetic, right, you have got a choice there of going down to battery, which would save you one.",1
"Marketing: And the last, paren parental advisory function.",1
User Interface: I think we have been successful.,0
Marketing: is used the most.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, we we will make w this one trendy.",0
"Marketing: and I'm thinking how do you change the hard would you put a sticker sort of? Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit, like a.",0
Industrial Designer: Down is channel down.,1
Industrial Designer: There should be really no problem.,0
"Marketing: so I think it is better when th the TV shuts down, the remote shuts down.",1
"Industrial Designer: The top screen, as we said, is would be an inset black, white LCD s touch screen.",1
Project Manager: we decided upon that in the last meeting.,1
"Marketing: remote control right now basically everybody says they want newer, fancier, more exciting they are sick of this boring, normal, functional, that we need innovative design options, there needs to be an easy user interface.",1
"Industrial Designer: So we have the energy source, we have the user interface, this is what I have seen.",1
"User Interface: and they look intelligent, I do not know, they are I guess it is the whole like binocular vision thing.",0
Project Manager: Do you wanna be next or you want Kate to go next?,0
Project Manager: what so wh what do we think about the the permanent battery?,0
"User Interface: So it is basically more or less how we would like it, with a big volume control, big channel control, mute, power, yeah?",1
"Industrial Designer: But we can implement it with simple push buttons, which is much cheaper.",1
Marketing: You wer you were not in Paris?,0
User Interface: We need one.,1
Project Manager: well I do not know who wants to go first with his presentation.,0
Industrial Designer: Because now it is just an average It is remote.,0
"User Interface: I think if they were just all small round blue buttons, it'd be fine.",1
Project Manager: Well maybe we should we should have a look globally glob.,0
"Project Manager: I would say, if I were to make a decision, I would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower end of the spectrum of importance.",1
Marketing: And thirty twenty six percent said remote controls are bad for RSI.,1
"User Interface: From looking at the remotes that are out there at the minute, none of them are particularly sleek, sexy.",1
"User Interface: Can you go on to the next slide? Yeah, now this is an interface for a chil for a remote which a child can use.",0
Project Manager: And we are gonna do this all in about forty minutes.,0
User Interface: So we have many concepts there.,0
"Industrial Designer: And then for the more functional buttons, we do not worry too much about that, just have that as like a plus it is hidden away anyway, you are not gonna see it at the start.",1
User Interface: No but except for the design of the surf.,1
"Industrial Designer: But I think it is good to follow the f flow, you know make it now, after, you know, if the people change their mind you change also the product.",1
"User Interface: So my personal preferences are to keep the nber of buttons to a limit, or to a minim, sorry, make frequently used buttons bigger, more strategically placed, so like the on button being really obvious one, the channel changing, the vole, to keep the design basically sleek, simple.",1
"Industrial Designer: I think it is because if you think about it, the watch, although it is only a tiny amount it is it is always moving for the whole day, they do not run out over night when you leave them on the side.",0
"User Interface: So he can use that kind of properties of features, then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular for a certain age, then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children cannot view that channel.",1
"Project Manager: like you can go over your ideas, of course, in your own personal times.",1
Project Manager: but we could but it is possible we could use like a lithi battery that would last a lot longer than like double As.,0
Marketing: You can just see what is up.,0
"Project Manager: so no, this is a these are two smartboards, with the f s an introduction of that one.",1
"User Interface: Because I really think i in a certain sense it almost like for me I would want to have that just, because I know at the end of when I'm done watching TV that when I'm done, I better go find the remote, put it back where it belongs.",1
"Marketing: One thing it goes on to talk about, which is interesting, is the hang on a minute.",0
Industrial Designer: Maybe till four o'clock or something?,0
"Marketing: And I do not know, like, there is such a problem with losing them,",0
Marketing: I'm not convinced on whether having changeable covers would be something that people would buy into.,1
User Interface: we can just make four pushbuttons in a form of a round.,1
Marketing: Just leave it.,0
"User Interface: i Yeah, I think so.",1
"Project Manager: Bu but was the was there not a button that you were thinking of on the on the other opt you know, on the second page, as it were, that you were thinking of maybe having as a different colour?",1
Industrial Designer: It is quite complicated.,0
"Industrial Designer: Lie, totally yellow, totally red.",0
User Interface: So would we like this or would we like the.,0
Project Manager: So we have got function what happened to the.,0
"Project Manager: So let is go for the lunch break, we will meet after.",0
Marketing: And th last thing is the easy to use factor.,0
"Marketing: Well, I if this is if you are ready to do that, then I think it deserves a one.",0
User Interface: Menu for the LCD screen.,1
Project Manager: The question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense.,1
"Industrial Designer: Well, these would be the main buttons, h you could change them later on in your own profile if you want to.",1
"Marketing: Whether it works or not, they have to first say I like this, I like the design, then it is gotta be simple to use.",1
"Marketing: well the drawboard, well you can draw things.",1
Project Manager: They are smart boards.,1
Industrial Designer: because Real Real Reaction sells more products than only remote controls.,1
"User Interface: No you know it is a conceptual question, 'cause now I see th this the picture in front of my eyes like a user taking his remote control, shouting into it, volume up, volume up,",0
"Marketing: so we give that a six,",1
"Project Manager: so would it not be best to rather than I mean one way is to do each of the presentations, then make decisions going back to the various presentations as they were.",0
Marketing: And fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room.,1
"Marketing: And we got reports from Paris, Milan on new fashions.",1
Industrial Designer: Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want.,0
"Marketing: Do we have other, for lack of a better word, skins? Covers?",1
"Marketing: it is maybe an option if you use an LCD or a touch screen, that in the middle are the main keys, like displayed on the.",1
Project Manager: so this is kind of.,0
"Project Manager: So what do you think of only the numbers, the onoff button or.",1
"Marketing: Alright, did anyone have any other features that they think were important that we did not talk about?",0
Marketing: Or something like that.,0
"Industrial Designer: but I think the basic functions are the logic, the transmitter, the receiver,",1
Marketing: So we are all already nineteen.,1
Project Manager: What kind of fr fruit would you like to control your TV with?,0
"User Interface: Cause I am not very sure, plastic, titani or whatever.",1
Project Manager: And something that might further complicate it is that the TV makes noise itself.,1
"Marketing: just 'cause I liked the pen, yeah.",0
User Interface: which one would you prefer? I guess this.,0
User Interface: maybe the menu button can go i in the middle.,1
"Marketing: No y no, the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard, extremely hard wood,",1
"Marketing: Yeah, this could be downloaded by the web maybe, or.",1
"Industrial Designer: Would you maybe have like one menu button, then you'd use the other buttons, maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions.",1
"User Interface: Yeah, w I think wh wha would we are trying to get to twenty five, thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as well they said.",0
Industrial Designer: I think the biggest struggle will be the easy to use feature.,1
"Marketing: But the screen can come up on the telly, the she said.",1
Marketing: You can cut the TFT screen.,0
"Project Manager: And then lastly we are going to determine its working design, how exactly will it perform its functions, that is the whole technical side of I will just give you a minute, 'cause it looks like you are making some notes.",1
"Industrial Designer: If we have a better shape of the remote control, or better options on it.",1
"Industrial Designer: No, I'm doing the interface.",1
Industrial Designer: so you know I think it is been fine.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yes, it can On your No, on your mobile phone you can y you can read text also.",0
Project Manager: So each of you have some presentatio presentation to perform who starts?,0
"Marketing: No, yeah, that is a good point.",0
Industrial Designer: But just a about the chip.,1
Industrial Designer: Maybe we can Something like that.,0
"Project Manager: At least I am, with the results,",1
User Interface: Just putting no excess buttons.,1
"Marketing: So I think maybe fewer buttons, which also make the design look sleeker, I dunno.",1
"Industrial Designer: for the buttons, I thought we'd probably get away with just having the standard push buttons rather than the scroll wheel.",1
"User Interface: Then there is this is the standard one with without any fancy thing you know like i it does not have teletext option, it can without any, it is a very simple thing, which you can vouch.",0
"Marketing: Or well, but like like more than just the battery, like a complete different like you have only got like, you know like th this bit is the bit you keep, this is the expensive bit, this is like the chip.",0
Industrial Designer: That is that is a good idea actually.,1
"Industrial Designer: I think the main impact is complexity,",0
Marketing: it came there on three minutes back so we are I think we can just press the.,0
Project Manager: Let is just use the acronyms.,0
"User Interface: so I want the controller to be easy to use, but with sophisticated functions.",1
Marketing: Then easy to use it is not so important actually with respect to other y other ones.,1
"Marketing: as far as speech recognition goes, the younger group looks like they are all for it.",1
"Marketing: One original colour, then sort of two supplements, I think maybe.",1
"Industrial Designer: yes, if it is limited vocabulary usually it is enough.",0
Marketing: Fifty f seventy five per cent of users say they s zap a lot.,1
"Industrial Designer: And so when you put it on the table, it will just lay down.",1
"User Interface: actually the user has to put some effort to do use that actually,",1
Project Manager: we could have a variety of options here.,0
Marketing: So it is not in theory but I can I can say yeah.,0
"User Interface: And the buttons, should they have colours?",1
"Project Manager: And what I'm thinking about, maybe we should make very light but a grip I mean this is how you hold a remote control.",1
Project Manager: And that would enable you to do it.,0
Marketing: There are more people who like speech recognition than an LCD screen.,1
Project Manager: You still have rubber d Or no.,0
"Marketing: But if you compare with these ones, I think they scored a one or two.",0
Industrial Designer: because if we add too much then.,0
"Project Manager: I do not I do not see the difference between kinetic, dynamo.",0
"Marketing: that could Yeah we could do that but I'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy, ease of use.",1
Industrial Designer: Guess I should probably try to sit up straight.,0
Industrial Designer: so my name is Petre.,1
"Project Manager: And we do not want it to cost any more than twelve fifty Euros, so fifty percent of the selling price.",1
"User Interface: so the options that we put on there should be easy to use, 'cause you have more room then, for elderly people big buttons.",1
"Marketing: Yeah, they have to be on it.",0
"Project Manager: I myself I find, when you, h when there is something like spee speech recognition.",1
Marketing: We can make a docking station for two thirty.,1
"Industrial Designer: It is an still an option, but not for this price.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, maybe the teletext tel.",0
Marketing: That is how it works.,0
"Project Manager: Anyway, let is see what you have.",0
Industrial Designer: I think if we we do both the obviously production costs are going to go way up but it does put it into it'd become the Rolls Royce of remote controls basically.,0
"User Interface: What I What I was thinking what do yous think of this?, having the numbers kind of like, not a bunch of grapes, but you know like purple, kind of in a triangle.",1
"Industrial Designer: they are going with the fashion thing, like the design, spongy rubber.",1
"Project Manager: The production cost are about half the price of selling price,",1
Marketing: And some of them it looks like barely need to be included at all.,1
Project Manager: is there Next meeting in thirty minutes.,1
Project Manager: You could choose to have that or not.,0
"Project Manager: Two three five two three fi, two.",0
"User Interface: so you all know me, I'm the Industrial Designer.",1
"Marketing: We have b built in the speech, where are you, function.",1
Industrial Designer: That kinda changes the whole situation.,1
Marketing: This will be something different from the other remotes remote controls.,1
Industrial Designer: Yes you'd know what kind of wood to get.,0
Project Manager: Because it is little bit hard to work with these plates.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, but this mean that your TV would be able to, you know, connect to internet, you know, surf the web.",1
"Marketing: I think I think this is a two, personally.",1
"Project Manager: Yi yes, yeah, I prese so.",0
"Project Manager: It is either that or we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed, do not know how long that took.",0
Marketing: We should make it glow in the dark.,1
"Industrial Designer: And I am Hemant, the industrial designer.",1
Industrial Designer: The red is supposed to represent the whatever else you wanna print on the side of it.,0
"Project Manager: But it would i be interesting for our marketing team, to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be.",1
"Marketing: those are just suggestions, also we need to decide whether this should be printed, so that still has to do with the material discuss should we print the fruit stuff, or should the actual remote look like a fruit?",1
Marketing: The remote control is easy to use.,1
"Project Manager: I do not think I j, really, I do not see how the LCD display is gonna add anything, you know, on a design level.",1
Project Manager: That is a that is a better idea?,0
"Industrial Designer: I th I think the there was not too much difference in the cost, that related to the actual buttons, but it does affect the printed circuit board.",1
Marketing: Could b still put them on the side.,1
"Project Manager: Because I think the d whole dynamic part, do you know, appeals to me qui thinking of our design philosophy, you know, with the rubber parts, sturdiness of the thing, y when you move it around a lot, then people find the idea funny that when I move my remote control around,",1
"Project Manager: What it costs under twelve, a half Euros? No?, yes they are.",1
Project Manager: I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part.,1
"User Interface: I do not know how to get to them,",0
"Marketing: But, we have to keep the cost in in mind, but it.",0
"Marketing: So, it has to be a group group decision.",0
User Interface: because it is otherwise people do not want to flip through all the channels.,0
"Project Manager: Without LCD, without speech recognition, it will be simple.",1
"Industrial Designer: this integrated circuitry takes energy from the power source, whatever like if you press a button it is like a input for the remote controller, it takes the input, it transforms into a infro infrared bits, it sends it into the device, like a TV or a air conditioner, something like that so.",1
"Marketing: Keeping it nice, slick, would be important.",0
"Industrial Designer: f as for the buttons, simple push buttons.",1
Industrial Designer: So I'd I think I'd give it a two I guess.,1
"User Interface: I think the type of people that are gonna want to buy a very stylish rem r remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gonna have you know a wireless internet connection maybe, or a you know.",1
Project Manager: We want backlit buttons.,1
"Industrial Designer: So here are multiple speech buttons, I do not know how many.",1
User Interface: so there may have been a m miscalculation in there.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, so you do not have to display here, just display on the TV screen, right?",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, I think I think we probably woulda used the outer email system more, had we actually had more time, if we'd been separated more.",1
Marketing: I guess it is gonna be hard to drink coffee.,0
"Marketing: Cause it is s it is separate is not it,",0
Industrial Designer: Let me just get this going first.,0
"Project Manager: Depends on the sensitivity of the microphone, but I think that is.",1
Marketing: But up till forty five it remains feasible.,0
Marketing: Can you repeat it?,0
"User Interface: Just one pressing, or quickly after each other.",1
"User Interface: And let us include two nice features into this device, first, power on, off can be made fully automatic.",1
"Project Manager: however the idea of a joystick, then maybe an LCD which has been kind of put forward so far, it is almost like having a small T not TV to say, but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display, I do not know how much power an LCD would take, but it might be quite low?",1
"User Interface: I think we did well in first of all giving our meetings the time,",1
Marketing: so I would give it a two.,1
"Marketing: Yeah, acco according to us, it is one? Or.",1
"Project Manager: well done yeah, yeah ok.",0
Project Manager: We have to evaluate the product yet.,1
Project Manager: But we will hold off on that 'cause.,0
User Interface: It was last time I saw it.,0
"Marketing: The other ones are the settings, they are used less than you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour, this means that I think we can we could have like a button for all the settings, then, just one, then from there go on to the audio on the screen, either on the remote or on the television.",1
"Marketing: You always have a print plate,",0
"User Interface: Well, maybe a little bit expensive.",1
User Interface: The one on the right is a lot more basic.,1
Marketing: So a lot of unused buttons.,1
"Industrial Designer: I'm just thinking, this is not my department, but I I'm not sure what this is gonna cost,",1
"Marketing: But dynamo the fact with dynamo is, the moment you move it, it c it creates energy on its own.",1
"Project Manager: Or maybe you have to show some specific programmes for kids, then just yeah just push kids button so it is automatically.",0
"Industrial Designer: When you want to go m move up, you just scroll up, clic on the button, if you wanna see the next, if you wanna see that channel.",1
Industrial Designer: Yeah I think that.,0
"Marketing: fruit, vegetables, important to this year important to furniture, I'm just gonna say f like it is in if fashion if we are going for the it looks fancy, then fashion is obviously the line we gotta be going through.",1
"Industrial Designer: I Most of the things I have to write myself on the board, but.",0
Project Manager: And I still have to do my minutes for the last meeting.,1
"User Interface: A battery in it, kinda.",0
Marketing: They disliked the lookandfeel of current remotes controls.,1
"Project Manager: Welcome at the functional design meeting, again presented by Maarten.",1
User Interface: I think we did pretty well.,0
User Interface: User Interface Designer.,0
"Marketing: Could we use like a jog dial, like a nice just sort of round, somewhere on it where you just roll it?",1
User Interface: so you can adjust it.,0
"Industrial Designer: I I have seen these remote controls with this little stick which you can move forward, sidewords.",0
Marketing: The remote control is made of soft material.,1
Marketing: and then it is.,0
User Interface: It still might be hard to.,0
User Interface: So maybe I can put six to seven.,1
"User Interface: Yeah, this so that is the thing you have to weigh against each other.",0
Project Manager: I think it is very easy to.,0
Project Manager: Well I guess it is maybe because I'm not s pen selected.,0
"User Interface: And we, we have a singlecurved.",0
Project Manager: And you are? In the project?,0
Industrial Designer: where you have to find out what which sign or icon means on every button.,0
Industrial Designer: I think it is just to lock it in.,0
"Industrial Designer: as for the actual components, Steph just said this is a quite a cheap device to manufacture.",0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah well d different screen settings a Yeah, sk.",0
"User Interface: Well, as you may know there is some research done in the field of producing energy from mechanical eng, I mean, producing electricity from mechanical energy.",1
"Marketing: So, the channel switching.",0
"Project Manager: I will talk about the new project requirements I have just received, then we have to make a decision on our remote control functions.",0
"Industrial Designer: So I wan I wanna go through not just addressing the the points that you made, Sarah, but doing my presentation in the order I wrote it.",0
"Project Manager: Yeah, that is true.",0
"Industrial Designer: Well, you have to make it work.",0
"Project Manager: Satisfaction with for example the room for creativity, leadership, teamwork, the means, any new ideas found.",1
"Industrial Designer: You have the switch turn it on, infrared bulb, will contact the TV, will have whatever device or DVD player, the bulb will turn on to say it is on.",1
Project Manager: I like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand.,1
"Marketing: if you flip the So, those are the criteria.",1
Project Manager: I think it is on the.,0
"Industrial Designer: Maybe someone ha we have to this whiteboard,",1
"Industrial Designer: So And the well, looking at room for creativity, there was w way too the choice of components was way too narrow.",1
"Project Manager: No those are one, I think.",0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, the personal preference, I did not fill it out.",0
Project Manager: So now I'm gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you.,1
"Industrial Designer: I do not think I hope nobody will eat it You know, to integrate the fruit aspect, you know the the in.",0
Project Manager: And the digi the digital pen? Did did you like that one?,0
Project Manager: We want a mode indicator.,1
Industrial Designer: You just need the nought.,0
"Project Manager: just literally just metropolitan San Diego, I live like five minutes from the zoo.",0
"Marketing: you know, to manipulate that to hav be a cover that you can pull off,",0
"Project Manager: forty minutes, I believe is the time.",0
"Marketing: I guess it is black, grey.",1
"User Interface: But we have to make sure that we are better usability, stand out by just looks of it.",1
"Industrial Designer: the onoff button, in red.",1
"User Interface: I thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme, I guess this one is obviously fruit shaped.",1
"Project Manager: So, I had some new information about the product requirements, so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking, in your designing of the remote control.",1
"Marketing: though it was really technically an evaluation of the product, not the project in general.",1
"Industrial Designer: So I will start by the basic one that fits into eight Euros actually, right, seven eight Euros,",1
Marketing: But they do tend to spend their money a lot easier.,1
"User Interface: As opposed to the twenty Euros, twenty five Euros.",0
"Marketing: Could I mean, you could hold it in your left hand, d use your index finger.",0
Industrial Designer: You are scaring me with LCD man.,0
"Marketing: I thought it was the age between sixteen, twenty, ninety nine per cent of the people like that.",0
User Interface: So it is actually a scale.,0
"Marketing: so I think what we need is a clear remote control with grouped buttons, you know.",0
Project Manager: in combination with the finance I I received a an an Excel file.,0
"Industrial Designer: You c But you can put it on the back, on the titanium part.",1
"Project Manager: if you look at the what we could do to make it more to make it just between the twelve Euro fifty, then I did the following changes.",0
"Industrial Designer: for the circuit board, again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote.",1
User Interface: it is two double A batteries.,0
"Marketing: But I could market that as a as a a I was thinking actually a cost saver down the road, in terms of battery, you know.",1
Industrial Designer: And back light LEDs.,1
"User Interface: And then on the right, we have what is really big trend right now, it is the iPod.",1
Project Manager: I will go through the mee through the minutes first.,0
User Interface: And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice.,1
"Marketing: And the recent fashion update, according to fashionwatchers in Paris, Milan, is that fruit, vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes, shoes, furniture.",1
"Marketing: We definitely need to focus on a new modern appearance, since so many people seem to be concerned about the ugliness of their remote control.",1
"Industrial Designer: To move up, move down.",1
Industrial Designer: yeah I think that is very doable.,0
Project Manager: It is taking it a little bit.,0
"Project Manager: I have one more slide before we close, but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this these kinds of things, so I will just bring that up, show you all.",1
"Marketing: So, we have to put stress on this, we have to take care of this fact also like our design, should be appropriate, should be good looking for the consumers.",1
Project Manager: You have the basic idea.,0
"Marketing: The method I used was Like I told I watched the trends from the past years about colours, shapes, material they wanted from elderly, young people.",1
"Marketing: I dunno, that might be expensive.",0
Marketing: Right now customers want fancy versus functional.,1
Marketing: we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly.,1
Marketing: Yeah that is improved pretty much.,0
"Marketing: Custome Customers, users do not like the way remote controls look, they do not like the way they feel, they do not think they match their operating behaviour, an example is what we were talking about, the buttons, they only use ten per cent of the buttons, so later on there is a study of the buttons that they use most, I think we should design according to these buttons.",1
"Marketing: And as these are ranked, the top one is doubly important to the second one, which is doubly important to the third one,",1
"Project Manager: Our profit aim is, worldwide, fifty million Euros.",1
"Project Manager: All right? Then, tool training try out the white board, participant can draw their favourite animal.",1
Industrial Designer: it depends which way you look at it.,0
"User Interface: right, that fits, does not it?",0
User Interface: It does not matter.,0
User Interface: the I think that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of changing the channel.,0
"Project Manager: And the case is curved on one side, but then flat, so it is flipped into each other.",1
"User Interface: I think everything has it for, I guess.",0
Project Manager: You have t produced something about that?,0
"Marketing: So I'm going to go, use the whiteboard, I have made a list of criteria to look at, so I'm gonna I'm gonna leave this up as the last thing, but for the evaluation it is going to be one is true, seven is false, going over these different criteria, so one true seven false, I'm gonna now use the the board.",1
Industrial Designer: Remotes do not have power on off switch.,0
"Project Manager: if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes, suggested shades or whatever, you could look into basically how it is made IE like how you make it all in one, how what sort of materials are available to you whatever.",1
"Industrial Designer: What is important for me, I guess, is that it is easy to use, that there is not too many buttons, they are not too small, you know you know you need to n to know what you are doing.",1
"Project Manager: we are gonna do a little tool training, so we are gonna work with that whiteboard behind you.",1
Project Manager: All of you.,1
"Industrial Designer: Is it started as a pear, but then it started looking more, more like a Martian.",1
"Marketing: on t Yeah, but easy n not the most easy to use, I think.",1
Industrial Designer: If it is plastic.,0
"Marketing: Yeah, I think Jen wants it to vibrate.",0
"Industrial Designer: one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part use visible light coming out of the remote, just kind of as a fun gimmick.",1
Marketing: Maybe they are supposed the pen is supposed to go over the seats.,0
"Marketing: Totally, it takes cheap speech recognition, she they wi.",0
Project Manager: you know with minimal number of buttons.,0
"Project Manager: Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes, then we have got a lunch break.",1
"Marketing: I in the base we could like make a button, if you push it, the remote control itself s makes noise.",1
"User Interface: And I think it is good because it is something new, usually young people like something new.",0
"Project Manager: Yeah, but where is the controller?",0
"Project Manager: And the third point, it is very important to establish our marketing or corporate image, with this new project or new product.",1
User Interface: It was necessary for me to.,0
"User Interface: Generally I developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface, but for possible instruction or user is manual, all the complex things that come together with your TV, remote controls.",1
"Project Manager: I think we should lose the LCD screen,",1
Project Manager: That is just now just we could just discuss how the project went.,1
User Interface: And also I think if we put some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier.,0
"Marketing: Yeah, we need to have the the LCD screen.",1
"User Interface: and the same for the volume, the channel,",0
Project Manager: I think so as like but you were supposed to have creativ.,1
Marketing: just wondering if my what about the pink the pinkness of that.,0
Industrial Designer: Which I asse would exclude some of the more sophisticated versions.,0
Marketing: I'm gonna pull this off.,0
User Interface: I do not know.,0
"User Interface: With the scroll, the LCD.",0
"Industrial Designer: Well, the working design.",1
"Project Manager: So it is easy to use, powerful, as the remote control a has only one button.",0
"Marketing: But then again, all these changes are not really with me.",1
User Interface: Opens up is too difficult.,0
Project Manager: W We will in a minute we will start with them.,0
Industrial Designer: Can you imagine you have to scroll a lot.,1
Marketing: So we believe in providing international market with fashionable products.,1
"Project Manager: or maybe it can respond, produce sound, so say where it is.",1
"Industrial Designer: we will have using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one, I mean, a although it does seem interesting.",1
"Marketing: yeah, maybe another problem, I think current TVs can even send infrared.",1
"Marketing: Yeah, wh which buttons you like or not.",0
"Marketing: We have this, we had the idea of an a more like sh in the shape of your hand.",1
Project Manager: Yeah? I will see you again when the computer tells us to.,0
Marketing: A And then you s then you can delete.,0
"Project Manager: sort of liaise between the three of you, get things going, get people talking, I'm gonna be making notes, sending them off to the powers that be, stuff basically.",0
"Industrial Designer: And so an energy source feeds an integrated circuit, the chip, that can compose messages, usually through a infrared bit.",1
"User Interface: We are We put fashion in electronics,",1
"Project Manager: And a last point, but also very important, our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products, which means that our corporate colour, slogan must be implemented in the new design.",1
"Marketing: and a substantial number of do not knows in the older age group, I think that is just general fear of new technology.",0
User Interface: Just by infrared.,1
"User Interface: So, basically, the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like, what people do not like about existing products.",0
"Industrial Designer: And I wanted to ask you m maybe afterwards, after our discussion, if we have some contacts in some companies, so, which can report on what is going on there, so, I would be glad if you can tell me about them.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, you can put it separate.",0
"Project Manager: So no more changes will be made, in this the basic design.? So we will introduce m this model, let is introduce in the market, let is take the feedback from the customers, then we can go for the.",1
"Project Manager: So, as we can see, that is way too expensive down here.",1
"User Interface: So that is maybe not something we have to decide just right now, is it.",0
"Project Manager: We are We We could go for the for the for the for the for a simple chip, but then we ca not have the speech recognition, yes? Yes?",1
"User Interface: I think, it has to be on the on the solar energy, but I do not know.",0
"User Interface: A little bit bigger, yeah but.",0
Project Manager: It is too expensive.,0
Marketing: So that is that was my reactions.,0
Marketing: Y the scroll wheel is dropped.,0
"Project Manager: So from my point of view, I do not think it is gonna be very very high tech, high definition, ultra modern kinda remote, for twelve fift twelve, a half Euro.",1
"Project Manager: They want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use, which the choices that we have discussed were pretty much battery, kinetic or solar.",1
"Marketing: That is like mine it was like, would you prefer an LCD screen or a multifunction remote control? And then it did not have like any kind of table, like awesome, I'm glad they asked that question, did not report the result.",0
"Marketing: And our production cost of twelve fifty Euros per unit is fairly high I think,",0
Project Manager: S th this I th that is always gonna be a problem I think.,0
Marketing: Another thing it is talking about there is the LCD screen but there is no figures apparently on that.,0
"Industrial Designer: And is not that too difficult for the we want w I do not know if we still want the RC to be easy to use,",0
Marketing: they should be technological in innovative.,1
Industrial Designer: I think we can put on the here.,1
"User Interface: And then if the battery limit is indicated, if it could be ind indicated through a blinking something.",1
"Marketing: Maybe the counts wou woulda been better if we had a list or more Yeah, to begin with.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah maybe we should go through, yeah an evaluation.",1
Industrial Designer: Colours I think the main colour of the remote control is the colour of the LCD screen.,1
Marketing: I like the idea that the onoff button is in a really prominent place.,1
"Project Manager: but the problem now is that the There is no such thing as a docking station in this list, but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents.",1
"Project Manager: Or if we want to use the latex, then we have to go with one of the other power things.",0
Project Manager: let is see.,0
User Interface: Six seven eight or five.,1
"Marketing: I have seen some remote controls that are big, they have a lot of buttons, you have to hold down more than one key at one time to do something, they are just not great to use.",1
"User Interface: but the volume control could double for that, for example.",0
User Interface: There are two different solutions I mean.,0
"Project Manager: it will be slim,",0
Marketing: Did you did you get that pc picture on did they provide you with that picture on the web?,0
"User Interface: Yeah, so we should also implement se screen settings.",0
"Project Manager: But if you get it well before the next meeting, let everybody else know 'cause that might have an impact on their on what they come up with effectively at the next meeting.",1
"Project Manager: to do it on a blank sheet, with different colours, I just showed you how to pick a colour, also with different pen widths which I also showed you.",1
Project Manager: Kinetic is ch makes it more expensive.,0
"Industrial Designer: The logo, the, the.",0
"Project Manager: I do not know the shortcut, so Ah F five.",0
"Marketing: so that is going back to what, you know, we were saying earlier about, you know, do you need all the buttons on the remote control,",1
"Project Manager: Our corporate colour, slogan must be used.",0
Marketing: Well but if we are gonna use a touch screen where it is gonna come on like on your cell phone it will have your carrier provider name come up first like while it is loading.,1
"User Interface: the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up, shifting down channel.",0
User Interface: We decided to use a single touchscreen.,1
"Industrial Designer: Then, components, so we have the main energy source, then we will have some buttons, then we will have infrared source, then we have some inside some chip in the device.",0
"Marketing: so first of all, the method that I used was by doing some marketing research,",1
"Project Manager: And then the, you know, the overall design of the case is Kendra is field,",0
User Interface: Since it is This is also rounded.,0
"User Interface: and every time we have to be very but if i the if we if we go to a different ways of designing those keys, then you can merge them together.",0
"User Interface: I think because there is already very good voice recognition technology out there, because ours might not cover the same functions that the leading brands do, it might be a good idea to market it as a finder function.",0
"Industrial Designer: And also for the VCR, DVD player.",0
Project Manager: and there are microphones here also.,1
Project Manager: Was pretty cool tack though.,1
"Project Manager: and for the people who really want a more sophisticated, more traditional look, they are willing to pay that.",1
Project Manager: I already took the liberty to make some suggestions.,0
"Industrial Designer: Just some ideas that I had, energy source, it is kinda hip to be eco friendly so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup.",1
User Interface: the important ones are the volume ones.,1
User Interface: Because different people have a different opinion about fancy.,1
"Marketing: well then you just have, you have a diff you have a mode switch.",1
Marketing: basically we are trying to get people to buy a remote control.,0
User Interface: But it is backwards.,0
Marketing: It is pretty hard to write.,0
"Industrial Designer: they should be m sh they should be in mind,",0
"Industrial Designer: And s I guess you have to mark special colour, special form as well, do not you? 'Cause it i it is very unconventional,",1
"Project Manager: Colourwise I mean you made a re was it you or I ca not remember who made the point about how if you have a nice bright colour you will not lose it, was that.",0
"Marketing: you have we could if we could save depending on the cost of the product itself, you know, could we have a cheaper b cheaper power source, then just have it annually renewed? Instead of having a ten year guarantee? With interchangeable covers, could just buy a new one every year, a new one when new fashions come out.",1
Project Manager: we are ready to close.,0
Industrial Designer: Let is cut to the chase.,0
Project Manager: So we can try to use the whiteboard here.,0
"Marketing: the vast majority of the thirty five, under age group would like a liquid crystal display, speech recognition, again that was to aid I think in when they have lost the actual remote control, some kind of speech recognition.",1
Project Manager: But I do not know if that will exceed the production costs.,0
"Project Manager: I think it might be smart to look at Ruud is information first, because I understood there are some significant changes in the market situation.",0
Industrial Designer: you know that might be a gimmick combined with rubber.,1
"User Interface: I do not know, we could use the voice.",1
"User Interface: So it is a one was true, seven was false?",0
"User Interface: But, I have also included this turbo button because I think, you know, every design should have a turbo button, well .",1
"Project Manager: So you You have an additional processor, software part.",0
Project Manager: the different systems that exist are infrared or radiowaves.,0
"Marketing: And when we are using that t remote, if we misplace somewhere, in the charger we have a small button, just by pressing the button in the charger the remote control beeps, wherever it is.",1
Marketing: but it will get very big the remote control.,0
"Project Manager: And, so I do not mind to convince, the management to spend some more money on the project, if you can make out of.",1
Project Manager: moving on to slightly more serious stuff.,0
"User Interface: Right except that it is sort of odd, I'm no not exactly sure why they are explaining it in the way they are, there is a sample sensor, there is a sample speaker unit for So, you would say like, good morning, coffeemaker, it would respond, good morning, Jill,",1
Project Manager: I we should go on a bit yeah about the project eval.,0
"Project Manager: so how sorry, can you just put that one back up again, please?.",0
"User Interface: No, it just small cobra, yeah.",0
"Marketing: I all made it possible for a positive questions, so we can count it.",1
"Project Manager: actually we are, you know, we are almost a half hour out of the forty minutes, so we have to get close to finishing.",1
"Project Manager: but according to this, maybe it is.",0
Marketing: A li little bit maybe?,0
"User Interface: There are some special ones available, like this one right here,",1
"Industrial Designer: I mean we were not really given a lot of time, or materials, yeah, to go about our design task.",1
"Project Manager: As you can see, twelve point five Euros per unit.",1
"Project Manager: We should probably start wrapping up, we have got some initial ideas that we can all look into.",1
"User Interface: so in terms of function, you have to be able to turn the TV on, off, volume, channel control, menu control, voice recognition control, we have incorporated the LCD screen on the flip panel as part of the design, if we figure out it is too expensive, well then you just take it off.",1
Project Manager: Does not really matter.,0
Industrial Designer: But for us it is yeah we have a constraint that we need to sell at twenty five Euros.,1
"Industrial Designer: I think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting,",1
"Project Manager: do you think maybe that is the only kind of essential requirements, then maybe just things that would be nice if it could do would be things like audio set up, display set up, things like that, maybe like a mute button, that sort of thing.",1
"User Interface: Yeah, easy to use,",1
"User Interface: Well, but the but the mute yeah, the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute, right?",1
"User Interface: Yeah, we are definitely not in the money making department.",0
"Project Manager: I hereby officially close the meeting, I hope to see you soon.",1
"Project Manager: Or someth something special, like MP three player inside of it, or.",1
"Project Manager: And new features, so we give it a two or also again a one? No, I think i if you have games on it, then you give you have a one.",1
"User Interface: like here you have a you know, a little flap th with a little control panel on the actual box itself.",1
Marketing: And we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age.,1
"Marketing: And we can come back to it, you said.",1
Project Manager: I guess we have c we have touched on most of this.,0
"Marketing: No because there are more yeah, we should not sum like that.",0
"Project Manager: If you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free, without any object.",1
Project Manager: It will be difficult to say just the name of the channel.,1
Marketing: Those who wanted to have it pink.,0
"Marketing: I'm supposed to make a little presentation, are not I?",1
Project Manager: So I think that would still make it a nice product.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, 'cause we could just sort of say, sorry what did you say about that or what do you think about that, rather than having to email it,",0
"Industrial Designer: What is to be said about it?, we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting.",1
"Marketing: I think like my colleague, you said, is that is e better, or for the elderly people something like the iPod or something, with round squares.",1
"Industrial Designer: Well, our slogan is not very long.",1
"Industrial Designer: I do not know exactly what that means, but it should be, well yeah, popular kind of.",0
"Marketing: And so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the team member, so.",0
Project Manager: She? Big brother.,0
"User Interface: Then for you can have a switch menu, so you put the switch menu to it tend to this kind of this category of functions.",0
Project Manager: We have two smart boards.,1
"User Interface: I would not know how to do it using a remote control,",0
"Industrial Designer: the buttons, there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer, but to use those we'd have to use more chips, that would cost us more.",1
"User Interface: to be honest actually, I mentioned some of the things which could fit on the on the this talk this time, I m I mentioned them already in the previous talk.",1
"Marketing: But, wha, look, what is the If you make it doublecurved, it costs one Euro more.",1
Industrial Designer: Keep the other buttons but hide them away.,0
Marketing: That could work.,0
"User Interface: The base is gonna be gunmetal gray, which is what we had decided, it is gonna be plastic.",1
Industrial Designer: We have your never mind.,0
"Project Manager: Th, well just very quickly.",0
"User Interface: I like the rubber, the stress balls, I think,",1
Project Manager: Digital pen is horrible.,1
Project Manager: so that is something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, it is just information that, like television timetables, what is on, what is on now, what is on next, on every channel,",1
User Interface: They are just simple TV remote controls.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, I guess How much of your PowerPoint was already done for you, every meeting.",1
"Industrial Designer: But maybe I think trendy people or like children where you can paint on it, the children think, this is my remote control, I made a picture on it.",1
"User Interface: You have to set them, reset them to everything.",1
"Project Manager: So you are in a sense, you are comparing the product without the company logo.",0
"User Interface: And else, to one, through after that.",0
"User Interface: I do not well, I do not know.",0
Project Manager: Maybe pear yeah or something like that.,1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, f very fancy trendy.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, app just apply them next to the zero, the one, the two.",1
"Marketing: d debating Yeah, yeah but that is just the thing is the quest in terms of the first point there, the room, it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave, then we come here, then we kind of put out our ideas, then, you know.",0
"Project Manager: The option, just the option, that is cool.",1
"Project Manager: The ID is going to work on the components concept, UID the user interface concept, you are going to do some trend watching.",1
Marketing: how many fronts fronts do we put on the market then? five or something?,0
"Marketing: We We are not building a universal remote, we are not building a high end product.",0
"Project Manager: We also have the rubber material,",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, it was it was a voice recognition,",0
Project Manager: We When you design a new product you of you of course want it to be original.,0
Project Manager: I think i it is kind of mangoey too.,0
Project Manager: The remote control should only be used for television.,1
"Industrial Designer: I guess it is three,",0
User Interface: yeah basically we st went with the colour yellow.,0
User Interface: I will work this out for the next meeting.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, what I do not understand what m.",0
"Project Manager: yeah, that would be cool.",1
Project Manager: And the production cost will be twelve Euro fifty max.,1
"Project Manager: So other than the fact that it does not have the second layer, but obviously it would.",0
"Project Manager: Well originally I was assuming we had the red apple, therefore, that was the special colour.",1
"User Interface: So it is a combination of easy to use, sophisticated functions.",1
"Project Manager: And you are going to be the User Interface,",0
Project Manager: Or yeah a one hand solution.,0
"Industrial Designer: Its job is to wait for you to press a key, then to translate that key press into infrared light signals, that are received by the television.",1
Project Manager: So you do the looking around at other remote controls.,1
"Marketing: Yeah, o On the other hand, if you want to make fruit fruity stuff with.",1
Project Manager: I mean how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff?,0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, or th or the.",0
Industrial Designer: but that is the way.,0
Industrial Designer: These are the main.,0
User Interface: So the here are some examples.,1
"User Interface: Or like you h you see those you know people I'm thinking of like celebrity cribs kind of things when like they have all those these things that at their house you know their entire house is so electronic, they have like this one master control that, it is like a hand held like turns on everything sort of control, it has like a screen, like so I think it should be possible to have some kind of a screen, I do not know if it must be it would probably.",1
Project Manager: then the conceptual design.,1
"Industrial Designer: I'm sure you could f work it out to fit in the casing, without causing too much difficulty.",0
Industrial Designer: Yeah but y how you need to know I.,0
Project Manager: and be a bit strange to have a fancy rome remote.,0
Project Manager: The production costs.,1
User Interface: I mean it might be nice for changing the volume.,0
"Industrial Designer: But then as I knew the tempo that I had to be on, the second time I think I did a bit better.",1
Project Manager: But I think most modern TVs have it in their menu.,1
Industrial Designer: that things like that usually c pop up on a televi like you hit menu.,0
"Marketing: But if it is a RR, it would be Real Reaction,",0
Project Manager: You take your remote control with you.,0
Industrial Designer: And this is more expensive than all the other chips.,1
"Industrial Designer: Mean you press a button the it tru goes, it sends a signal to a chip,",1
Marketing: Probably more towards three than two.,0
"Project Manager: we have meeting, individual work, meeting.",1
User Interface: Congratulations to the team.,0
Project Manager: It performs the action.,1
"Project Manager: equivalent to solar cells, which I think is probably fair considering that we have inhouse manufacturing of power adaptors already.",1
"Project Manager: Th in that way we have like only the numbers, the power button, skip, volume, then ten rem.",1
"Project Manager: I do not think anybody dominated it, which I thought was really good, like each of us was able to like each of you had your information, I I tried to facilitate it without like taking over,",0
"Project Manager: given you know, the number of things you buy these days, which you know, have a lithium whatever battery in, that is, you know never needs replacing.",1
User Interface: The fronts y you can do anything with them.,0
Industrial Designer: If you if you go to.,0
Marketing: Remote controls are often lost somewhere.,1
Project Manager: the User Interface Designer has to look at the technical functions.,0
User Interface: With this advanced features we I think we can attract a lot of user.,0
Marketing: Functional requirement by me Ebenezer.,1
"Marketing: I dunno maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the TV or maybe that is b it would have to incorporate, but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control.",1
"Project Manager: I would imagine all of them,",0
Marketing: I will take this one.,0
"User Interface: The method? Well I used my own experience with remotes, took a good l look at the remotes on the corporate website, which are these two.",1
Project Manager: No so a few legs.,0
Project Manager: But it is still fashion.,0
Industrial Designer: I mean if Yeah it is it is qui it is quite a cool feature to have.,0
Project Manager: I like the whole sort of remote feedback thing.,1
Project Manager: You can put games on your remote control.,1
"Industrial Designer: It can be made of plastic, rubber, wood o if you like, or titanium.",1
"Project Manager: it is cur it is double curved, so its curved all around.",1
"Marketing: because I think everybody is experienced with remote controls, some remote controls are worth throwing out the window.",0
Industrial Designer: Like the chip is probably the most expensive part.,1
User Interface: And it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well.,1
Marketing: Maybe make it like fruity colours or something.,1
Project Manager: Just make a new blank new blank page.,1
"Project Manager: New ideas found, so one or two.",1
Industrial Designer: So this actually basic the idea.,1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah that would be fairly simple,",0
"Project Manager: So the case, we have gone for the double curved.",1
"Project Manager: And afterwards, we closing.",0
"Project Manager: And moreover, th the button ar are lighted so you immediately identify the right side, because you have light on buttons.",0
"Industrial Designer: We could, the environmental factor, we did not bring that up again.",1
Project Manager: so that was the last meeting.,0
Industrial Designer: If make it useable for more than one device it is a it is hard but I think it is possible.,0
Marketing: I'm not good at golf.,0
"User Interface: Yeah, if you are really lonely, it is it is.",0
"Project Manager: So these are all things, of course, to remember with the budget, when you design to materials, cost, etcetera.",0
Industrial Designer: You really like the parental advisory.,0
"Industrial Designer: the chip, of course the infrared bulb, so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to.",0
"Marketing: I was a little vague on what exactly I'm supposed to do, but let me I have to like write something on the whiteboard, so.",1
"Project Manager: so long as it works,",0
Project Manager: S a very bright strawberry.,0
"Marketing: And then maybe sort of an enter button for sort of s you know, saying that you want that particular thing tuned in.",1
User Interface: So you can program the TV.,0
Project Manager: Maybe one of you can paint it on the board.,1
"Project Manager: We are going for twenty five Euros sales price,",0
"Marketing: Yes, so the It tells us something, yes.",1
User Interface: I also think we should not add too many buttons.,1
"Industrial Designer: the kinetic provision of energy which means if you move the thing, if you shake it.",1
"Industrial Designer: the pushbutton if we are gonna have pushbuttons, they require a simple chip, but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip, an LCD requires advanced.",1
"User Interface: That is yeah that is that is form, function in the one in the one object.",0
"Project Manager: I think these are more important than the first ones, so.",0
"User Interface: yeah s pause or stop, then you can you have a LCD display, here.",1
"Industrial Designer: We have to really understand what patterns are used, so we can o On the Otherwise it wo not work.",1
Project Manager: Yeah on the chip there.,0
"User Interface: Well leadership is a bit of a funny one, is not it.",0
"User Interface: it says on there what we need to do for the next meeting, I think.",1
"Industrial Designer: On thing One small thing, the added functions.",1
User Interface: So the only time problem is the sp voice recognition.,1
User Interface: And the other one is for the teletext or something you want to browse through from that.,1
"User Interface: I do not it could be a graphical display, the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an iPod where you just sort of control through the menus.",1
"User Interface: it is like black, black, white kind of.",0
Marketing: They want us to tell them.,0
"Project Manager: I'm not sure, but I'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of the USB might be prohibitive.",1
"Marketing: But the screen is useful, in essence, but it does not work that well.",1
Project Manager: it might be more difficult to do.,0
"Industrial Designer: so r we understand this better now that the speaker is for the feedback, right? It says the things that you type in or something like that, so.",0
Project Manager: We should hide them somewhere.,1
"User Interface: Yeah, our division has developed a new speech recognition feature, the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit.",1
"Project Manager: Yes, that is you have to decide, so the best thing is you both of the Christine, you discuss with yourself, come up with the cost, how we are going to compete in the market, in the technically, or in the sales wise, the commercial wise.",1
"Marketing: I think once you have 'cause you have the channel features b you have the screen features, audio features, the you have all buttons on it which you'd like, microphone extra, LCD screen extra, scroll thing extra.",1
"Project Manager: Look I have got a new remote control,",0
Industrial Designer: Or if we just do the usual button thing.,0
Marketing: We can we can o we can accentuate whatever whatever product you put in there we can find a way to accentuate it.,1
Industrial Designer: N well we have a bit of a problem I think.,0
"Marketing: There are several that have gone through with the watches, too.",0
Marketing: In the design phase.,1
Marketing: Well our findings.,0
"User Interface: But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that there should be a function, instead of choosing the ch TV channel, there is a option you can choose, either TV channels or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme.",1
"User Interface: My original idea was just simply sort of a sphere, where maybe you this is where it is connected together, then when you open it out, it could fol it could be maybe flip, like a flip phone, then when you fold it out the middle Maybe a hinge that will have to be the strongest part of it.",1
Project Manager: Mind if we move on? Ps.,0
"Marketing: Always, so fifty percent of the people say they lose the remotes.",0
"Industrial Designer: We think we got stifled for cri creativity by the company itself, in restricting us only to using a TV remote, initially.",1
"Industrial Designer: One would be audio controls,",1
Project Manager: Put I guess for disfmarer.,0
Project Manager: I imagine it probably is our sale actually.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, special colours, fruity colours.",0
Industrial Designer: Do you have a turtle pet?,0
"Project Manager: then if, you know, if people lose the cover, I mean they might be well inclined to go out, spend however many Euros on a on a new one rather than a complete new re remote.",1
"Marketing: Yeah, w It just has to be w when it is deliver out of the store, it has to be just simple, plain.",0
"Project Manager: So, we will have again three presentation, from all of you, I hope it will be fast because I would like to have time to for long discussion, decisions.",1
"Project Manager: I'm all for them actually, I think they are quite you know th very quick to m to use.",0
"Marketing: No, I mean I thought the pen was a little distracting for me personally, like its heaviness, like just being so conscious of like turning the pages, I dunno.",1
"Project Manager: It feels a bit more comfortable, maybe we could incorporate plastic, rubber into it.",1
Project Manager: Then we have three presentations.,1
Project Manager: Does anybody want to Andrew do you want what do you want to say about the yeah the evaluation.,0
"Marketing: Yeah, no, or maybe session of five minutes together or something, then work separate.",1
"Industrial Designer: But I really think that we should maybe think about the kinetic energy,",0
"Project Manager: Yeah, I think this if you you have to n know if it is for s a TV, a DVD player, all that things.",1
"Industrial Designer: So one plus one would be eleven,",1
"User Interface: If you have all of them, all the old, new TVs smed up,",1
"Marketing: Then you can watch what your ah you could also record your record your sequence of actions,",0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, yeah, sure.",0
"User Interface: what other things do we see here, well, if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel,",1
"Marketing: And then you have the other thing, that seventy five percent zap a lot, but that is not a f question with the LCD screen.",1
User Interface: It is not very promising but you know we are not young trendsetters.,0
Project Manager: User Interface Designer.,1
"User Interface: well, when we put in fancy colours, yeah.",1
Project Manager: I think the the basic concept i is absolutely bang on.,0
"Marketing: They could be interchangeable, they are spongy, that goes back to ergonomic, the youngsters love 'em, fun for the whole family, everyone can have their own.",1
"Marketing: So fancy enough means, does it comes to the younger people, the elder people.",1
Marketing: well the interface type supplements.,0
Marketing: I think because I have two televisions at home.,1
"User Interface: So So I should look at what you should be able to do with the remote, or, or how I do not really.",0
"Marketing: No, I guess, I do not know much about the remote control industry, how much your average sells for,",1
User Interface: Well you ca not you ca not draw on a laptop like you like you paint of or draw with your hand.,0
Marketing: ma make it not necessar sp spongy is the current thing.,1
"Industrial Designer: there could be a little microphone on it, any noise over a certain threshold it will pick up as a distress signal from you, it will beep back, say you know here I am or something of this sort.",1
"User Interface: Yeah, you can put 'em all on the back.",0
"Industrial Designer: Would probably be like a scrolling, little scrolling wheel like this.",1
"Industrial Designer: Big one, they are not easy to use.",0
"Marketing: What I thought, even young people say it is hard to use, remote control.",1
Marketing: And seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly.,1
"User Interface: I was try I was thinking, moving your thumb like this, what does that remind me of?",0
Industrial Designer: That is right.,0
"User Interface: In the present market I saw it that says something like they are looking for eighty word thing, eighty word,",1
Project Manager: Then this is the design.,1
"Marketing: I think a flip up thing, 'cause you always have this problem of like if it is on this well I did anyway, like we had five or six remotes, they would be lying on the c on the coach, you'd come, sit down, the telephone is the television switched on or something.",0
"Project Manager: User interface concept, we want it to be something simple.",1
Marketing: And new TVs will have internet access on them.,0
Project Manager: And we do not want that.,0
User Interface: Let is make everything a two.,0
Industrial Designer: Maybe we can use it for our party.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yeah so what we might wanna do is yeah cust I have customised the screen functions, if you know what I mean.",1
User Interface: Well here we have also side scrolls.,1
Project Manager: It is a possibility.,0
"Project Manager: then we considered some design options with how it should look, we discussed an iPodlike button system which, we have not concluded but we are Right, So, if you all have presentations to do, we can see what where you have come from our last time.",1
"Project Manager: So, now we will try out the whiteboard we have here.",1
User Interface: it is not very tangible.,0
Marketing: I'm from around DC ish sort of in the US.,0
Project Manager: I thought the light from the inside was gonna light up.,1
Marketing: I'm the Marketing Expert for this project.,1
Project Manager: Welcome to this second meeting.,1
Marketing: I in the very beginning it said with the with the advent of computers there is gonna be the it is gonna be outmoded teletext.,0
Marketing: I'm the Marketing Expert.,1
"Marketing: we can interview current users, future users.",0
Marketing: Watch I have my cord behind you here.,0
User Interface: From their I will just use it from their website.,1
"Project Manager: I mean it is probably more fruit, veg than most other things out there bar fruit, veg, so, what, four?",0
Industrial Designer: But I think the circle only does channel is not applicable to DVD really 'cause you do not wanna.,0
"Project Manager: so inbetween now, then, as the industrial designer, you are gonna be working on you know the actual working design of it.",0
"User Interface: Well I just I just made the point, I do not I do not know if that speech recognition is, you know, even if we can do it, I think it is not really appropriate for television environment.",1
"User Interface: You can use a basic battery, which we have already discussed, th our tech department also said we have the option of doing some kind of hand dynamo where maybe you crank it or something like that.",1
User Interface: Not very much.,1
Marketing: So to me it is about selling d our identity our corporate identity along with the product.,0
"Marketing: But it is better to have in the front, this kind of shape, because it looks nice.",1
"Project Manager: we can put a hand dynamo, a battery if you want.",0
"Marketing: But a coffee machine, there is not too many words they'd be using with that it is a it is a small vocabulary.",1
Industrial Designer: But it is just if you want all functionalities.,0
Project Manager: we are gonna have a prototype presentation first.,0
"Industrial Designer: It need maybe some wo further work, but it is.",1
"User Interface: And then to access the more complicated functions you'd you sorta go, you press that, go through the menus.",1
"Marketing: One hundred, sixty eight times per hour.",0
"Marketing: Yeah, I think it is, well technologically using, it is not it does not contain many new features.",1
"User Interface: Well, I f I think it is probably more than, than our can handle because it is designed for a coffee machine, you know, to say hello in the morning.",1
Project Manager: And also trendwatching.,1
User Interface: reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting.,1
"User Interface: but I think that is I think that sums up the main features of our of the remote,",0
User Interface: I do not think it is rubber.,0
User Interface: there are two types of user interfaces.,1
Project Manager: So we must let it stand on this this programme.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah let is do it, let is do.",0
"Industrial Designer: then as far as the way it is shaped, we can do standard boring flat, which we probably do not wanna do, curved or very sexy double curved.",1
Project Manager: Thin there it i Five minutes to go.,0
"Marketing: Yeah I'm thinking of the airport portal,",1
User Interface: It is two point one seven.,1
"Project Manager: hey, we want to do it with our fingers,",0
User Interface: yeah maybe when we n just give the nbers of o one of out of s sev.,0
"User Interface: And enter in the middle,",1
"Project Manager: Yeah I think the last time we had a lot of information, but at the same time not quite enough,",1
"Marketing: I do not think that is something we have to look at, find a way of raising the cash for.",0
"Project Manager: And how we are going to do it is each of us is going to We are gonna have discuss the functional design first, how is it gonna be used, what is the actual goal here, it has to operate TV, blah.",1
User Interface: But I think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than the numbers.,0
"Marketing: Twelve Euros, what is that, like eight pounds or something like that, nine Pounds?",0
"User Interface: I was thinking about the special button for subtitles, just one button to keep it simple.",0
"Marketing: But then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people,",1
Project Manager: So what bit are we on to?,0
Industrial Designer: So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it.,1
"User Interface: I mean I think that we really have two main selling points, I think that our casing, the voice recognition.",1
User Interface: Th they either these with the the charger any.,0
Marketing: Well you know for marketing f marketing for me is how do I go here?.,0
Project Manager: Welcome to the detailed design meeting.,0
Marketing: They are high interested in feature.,0
"Project Manager: Aye, I see what you mean, yeah.",0
"Project Manager: This is our final meeting, the detailed design meeting.",1
"Industrial Designer: No, this is a standard colour.",1
User Interface: You have to look at that image of the iPod.,1
Industrial Designer: They wo not know until after they bought it.,0
User Interface: No we have a product which none of us would buy.,1
Industrial Designer: It w yeah.,0
Project Manager: Yeah maybe at the bottom where you can hel hold it with you hand that there is also a microphone.,0
User Interface: Five minutes in the meeting.,1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, but we could do a lot of, lot more curving.",1
"User Interface: It is as simple as you, we could make it really.",1
Marketing: So we will say we will say false.,0
"Marketing: Now if we are gonna take a risk, push this up a bit, make it more expensive,",1
Marketing: you must find it quickly.,0
Marketing: And what ki what kind of what kind of basic colours were you thought of?,0
"Marketing: The fashion, now this is seems a bit odd to me, but fruit, veg is the new is the new black for furniture, for clothes, for shoes.",1
"Industrial Designer: But it look Yes, but that remote controls are already on the market.",0
"Industrial Designer: Those things were all like bright red, bright red, flashy.",1
Industrial Designer: touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro.,1
Marketing: because that is a major that is a.,0
Project Manager: But I do not think it should be very it should be one of the big buttons for example.,0
"Project Manager: will there be anything written on the buttons, like that people know, or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what?",0
"Project Manager: I mean it its I that is an interesting idea, it is like the old Swatch watch where on only batteries ever got changed in those, 'cause people just bought a new one when it went out of fashion,",1
"Marketing: so I think, I think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more.",1
"Project Manager: Yeah, I think, yeah re I thought it was like really creative actually, I mean.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah f I know about this, since it is my it is exactly my field, so.",0
Project Manager: Which does not really help me much.,0
Industrial Designer: I will draw a little turtle for you all.,1
Project Manager: We have got the eraser.,0
Marketing: The remote control has builtin games?,1
Project Manager: I goin I'm going to share with you.,1
"Project Manager: The chip, we are going for an advanced chip on print.",0
"Marketing: You can sorta get out, they sorta never get tired.",0
"Marketing: And on the LCD, how much it costs?, it costs extra?",1
Project Manager: It is like a very simple paint application.,0
Industrial Designer: Not Nothing squarelike.,1
Project Manager: So let is do that quickly.,0
Project Manager: Actually I have not thought of anything yet.,0
Industrial Designer: we still have to make We have still have to make the es the real basic design.,0
Project Manager: So that brings us to the discussion about our concepts.,1
Project Manager: I quite like the multicoloured buttons myself.,0
"Project Manager: We will then t take decision in concert, then we will define the nest next task, to have to be done before the next meeting.",1
"Project Manager: And the ME, what does that stand for? M.",1
"Industrial Designer: And the logo is over here, the mic.",1
"User Interface: And then it must be easy to use, so it must follow some conventions like whereabouts you find the on off button, maybe the colour tends to be red or something.",1
"Project Manager: And then we are going to determine the technical functions, what is the effect of the apparatus, what actually is it supposed to do, what do people pick up the remote, use it for.",1
"Industrial Designer: Old fashioned button, to satisfy the grandmothers.",0
Project Manager: We put the fashion in electronics.,1
Industrial Designer: the case alone for remote control is at least one Euro.,0
"Industrial Designer: Ah, we got new idea, speech recognition, location finding.",1
"User Interface: Maybe you can make, for channel changing, two little buttons on the side of the remote, so you can just do like this.",1
Project Manager: So but what did the marketing.,0
"Project Manager: This remote control, it can be for like universal, to use for any TV.",1
Marketing: I did not even read those.,0
"Industrial Designer: Could we get something that just has No does not have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or program s other things that I'm not very coherent about, but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything, you know volume control, on, off,",1
"Project Manager: So the keywords are primary co colours, spongey?",1
"Marketing: Lie what all colleagues said, have to have to be minimalized.",1
"User Interface: cause we decided not to make two f fresh colours, as it would not.",1
"Project Manager: and it is a function of frequency, relevance.",0
"Project Manager: so that if you are holding it, you know, anyway like you are likely to, it is you know, i it will work most of the time.",0
"Industrial Designer: So, the way I'm gonna do this is we are gonna take a look at some old remote controls, see how they work, reuse the vital kind of essential pieces of it,",1
"Project Manager: this thing it could be a turtle, or a snail,",1
Marketing: Which programme you are l watching or something.,1
Marketing: For a fixed vocabulary it works quite well.,1
"Project Manager: We have not been dealin we have not been dealing with dollars though,",0
User Interface: this is a user centred one.,0
"User Interface: but we think that this you know, this size will be we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow.",0
"Project Manager: So Right, so we have got ID the Come on, where is my.",0
"User Interface: Yeah, it is very interesting.",0
"Industrial Designer: If you aim at a young public, you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green, blue, red.",1
