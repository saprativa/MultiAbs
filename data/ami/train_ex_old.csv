Project Manager: And product evaluation.,1
"Marketing: Try it, yeah maybe.",0
"Project Manager: I mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it, so, you know.",1
"User Interface: And basically it depends like the remote with LCD display for browsing because you have multiple functionalities for example you are watching a movie, you are having a universal remote control, you want to you do not know really which functionality is now, so I am using the TV so every time I use it, it could be like, for example I can use a simple toggle switch, a display, so I press it so the display says, I'm in TV or DVD or whatever it is, instead of having three keys separately for four keys,",1
Project Manager: Maybe you can look how much it is for the LCD.,0
"Industrial Designer: I think controlling is not the right word, I think the interactions are very structured.",1
Project Manager: They cost us all the same.,0
"Industrial Designer: May fail though, every here, there.",1
"Project Manager: So big buttons, flashy design, maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing.",1
Project Manager: It does not tell me.,0
"Industrial Designer: I do not think there is a sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a, like a consensus right, we go around, we think about it,",1
Industrial Designer: is that a function we want in the remote?,0
Marketing: Same sort of function? The criteria? It is alright.,0
Project Manager: let me see.,0

User Interface: Like you said before.,0
"Marketing: we can make it brown, dark brown, not wood.",1
Project Manager: I think it is not too expensive.,0
Marketing: You had different remote controls for different devices.,1
"Marketing: but ninety one percent, fifteen to twenty five.",1
Marketing: So we can launch it.,1
Project Manager: so I will I let David Jordan do his presentation.,0
"Industrial Designer: The second version is also simpler, we d we had just I have to put the microphone also.",1
Industrial Designer: So at least seven to seven.,0
"Marketing: We could make things much more f I think the eighty percent of people would spend more on a remote that looks better, combined with decrease the or take out the limited functio functions that we do not really use much.",0
Project Manager: And would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition?,1
"Marketing: Like I do not know if they would actually go out, purchase this themselves, a fifteen year old you know.",1
Project Manager: but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer.,0
Project Manager: what is a hand dynamo?,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, two years' time this will be on the market.",0
Project Manager: I would say a two.,1
Project Manager: let is call this to an end.,0
"Marketing: One is fancy look, second is innovative, third is easy to use.",1
Industrial Designer: So maybe there is like a set design which we get printed off.,0
"Project Manager: But you do mention the next, previous button.",0
"Marketing: normally you only every use, you know, on a TV remote you only ever use, mostly, you know, f four or f six buttons.",1
"Industrial Designer: Why would you put it then, where is the recording the microphone?",0
"User Interface: No, tha that w that w that would be more promising.",0
"Marketing: So maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use, trendy, fancy, feels good, with a display, wood, designer wood, designer colours.",1
Marketing: ease of use.,1
Project Manager: I'm gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders.,1

"Project Manager: Twelve, a half Euros is what supposed to cost us.",0
User Interface: You have to do it over.,1
Project Manager: But remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the.,0
Industrial Designer: I'm the Industrial Designer.,1
"Project Manager: Right, we are gonna try out the electronic whiteboards.",0
"Marketing: Because we decided to have two kind of remotes, two designs, or was it two colours?",1
"Marketing: Hey, what what is the company colour? Did you get told what the company colour is or.",0
User Interface: like it is just been brought up again then.,0
User Interface: So you so you move to the next the next one.,1
Industrial Designer: Or we can do something like that.,1
Project Manager: Thank you very much.,0
"Project Manager: Yeah, if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five,",1
User Interface: We will not use this.,1
Industrial Designer: and discuss it in the next meeting.,0
"User Interface: So you generally see rectangular shape, very monotonous kind of designs here.",1
"Industrial Designer: Because we have tried to make it a little bit innovative,",0
"Marketing: So, I would give this a five.",1
User Interface: what is the purpose of the light?,0
Project Manager: I do not see any power cables here so.,0
Project Manager: Because we have to decide this.,0
"Project Manager: we want it to be original, something that is people have not thought of, that is not out in the shops, trendy, appealing to a wide market, but you know, not a hunk of metal, userfriendly, grannies to kids, maybe even pooches should be able to use it.",1
"Industrial Designer: Yeah, a little bit.",1
Industrial Designer: I'm just thinking totally different designs also.,1
Project Manager: It is the little blue w it is the one th.,0
User Interface: and would cost us to build it about eight Euros.,0
Project Manager: So we need to calculate the production cost.,1
Marketing: Yeah but if you shape it.,0
Marketing: fifty percent I think of all these nbers the most important is fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons.,1
Industrial Designer: Fr I mean the never mind.,0
"Project Manager: but if we all have a think, when we go away from the meeting, what specific things could be included in this remote control that are out of the ordinary.",1
"Marketing: Well I have noticed that gaming c is becoming quite popular with television, when I was younger we used to e play games using our cable, using the cable subscribed the cable providers,",1
"Industrial Designer: I thought but this is really your department, that we need just the functional display, four cursors.",1
"Industrial Designer: This is incremental, but once you press it for a long time, you go five by five.",1
"Project Manager: I have got I think we should also have a backup plan of I 'cause I just think that it might be expensive to make something that I mean we do not, we have not been told it has to be something that will control everything.",0
Project Manager: that pen drawings.,0
"Project Manager: It is actually a novel thing because you could sell it a as a novelty, just to be actually serious for a minute here,",0

Marketing: criteria four is costs.,1
"Project Manager: Yeah, the project is evaluated.",0
User Interface: but these are these are all necessary functions.,0
"Industrial Designer: Yes, but when you put that same volt voltages on it, you can put when the when the when o the lowest part of it, when it is o the same as the other products, you can put it all on the same.",1
"User Interface: the distance from your television to your remote control has to be, yeah yeah, quite a big distance.",1
"Marketing: they have like a touch screen with really big pictures on it like call hangup, that is a big ad advantage I think, because one the one hand you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by scaling up the pictures or something.",1
"Marketing: I guess the other option, referring to the battery thing is, you know how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds or something, when you are s, then it goes,",1
"User Interface: about yeah like yeah, a bit like radio presets.",0
"User Interface: You need to change channels, both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing.",1
Marketing: you only have channel button or volume button.,1
User Interface: Programming them can be a right pain.,1
"User Interface: in writing letters, of course, yeah? Yeah, normally, this the w Block letter sign it, yeah?",0
"User Interface: I mean there are there are advantages, disadvantages if you if you have an LCD display, it is nice, because it is it lets you just sort of sit there, st, control your television from your armchair.",0

User Interface: It is just a bird.,0
"Project Manager: The sample sensor, for speak recognition anyway.",0
"User Interface: 'Cause we have brought it down to basically four controls most common, which are channel, volume.",0
"Industrial Designer: So or maybe set it out in the sun, it, you know, gets, from the light, a solar cell inside there.",1
Project Manager: I will delete this one now because we do not use it yet.,0
"Industrial Designer: But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control, because it will just lie there for a long while sometimes.",1
