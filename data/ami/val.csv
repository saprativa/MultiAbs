Is that alright? or Okay. Keeps coming off. 'S fiddly. Right. Oh  another one. Ah. Very nice. 'Kay. Okay. Clip. Ah. It's an elephant. Oh my gosh  I'm never gonna be able to draw that well. Does it? Oh. Mm. I have no idea what my favourite animal is. Oh. It's A what? Alright. How. No. Great. Me? Okay. Not quite sure how this is gonna work. Cool. Uh well I'll try my best to draw. Can I just draw the face? Ooh. It's a cat. Which also has what? A big fat body and big and a long tail. Why? Because um cuddly. And usually cats are very friendly. Usually. And they're healing as well. They heal. And they can feel when a human's got problems so So  that's why I like cats. There we are  that's me. Mm. Mm-hmm. Ah. Market range internationally sold. Ah right okay. Yeah. Yeah. Uh. Yeah. Yeah it's a T_V_ remote control. Well. A new remote control for T_V_. What would I like? Um. Medium. Mm. Twelve fifty. Each. Guess Couldn't we have like one that comes out? Like so you have one in like mm it doesn't have to be really thick. I mean remote controls can be thin bits. And then you have one for your D_V_D_ and you sort of slide it out  and then you have another one  you slide it out. have slides. And then it all comes compact into one. So it's not you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner  and um into one basically. So you just flip them out. That would be cool. I was thinking that like a flip. Okay. Um.. But what'll make it what'll make it interesting for people to buy though? I mean if it's if it's just like Mm-hmm. Mm. I think a flip up thing  'cause you always have this problem of like if it's on this well I did anyway  like we had five or six remotes and they would be lying on the c on the coach  and you'd come and sit down and ooh  the telephone's the television switched on or something. So maybe something that like does have a lid or closes  so you don't accidentally press a button or record button for something. Yeah. But make it like really snazzy and cool people will want it. So make it Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. And even for kids as well. It's um it's safer for them  I guess. Like they don't flick onto channels and all that sl flick onto. Mm. W What does I_D_V_I_D_N_M_E_ stand for? Ah ri okay. these are requirement specification. And I'm marketing. These are requirement specification. So what the user requires in a remote. I guess that's what it says. Mm. So  do we take these off? Yeah. The back end of an elephant. Aesthetic yep  sure. 'Kay  my favourite animal  uh let's see. Dunno if any of you have seen Napoleon Dynamite before. It's a liger  a combination of a lion and tiger. Have you not seen Napoleon Dynamite? Oh it's a hilarious movie. You have to see it. And and it's best characteristic is it's pretty much the awesomest animal. But you have to see the movie to fully appreciate it. There go. A prairie dog? Oh a squirrel? Yeah  that's pretty good. Alright. So I think before we close uh  we are expected I mean the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer what our what our ideas where. I mean if you wanna go back to the last slide. Uh S Yeah  I think we're I mean before we close the meeting  we're supposed to come up with some ideas for Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  I think this is just the preliminary  get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls have been and and what we would roughly what we would incorporate into a new one maybe. Yeah  I think we've all got Mm. Yeah it seems like there's like there's sort of a tension between two ideas  I mean  you want you want one remote that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of T_V_ and if you have whatever associated with T_V_ the D_V_D_ player  or something like that  but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something. Mm. Yeah. It g can't be more than twelve fifty per unit. Cost. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not sure if that's like I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though  'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it. Oh. Oh okay. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah  we should uh I guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a a rough conception you know stage one was technical functions design  what effect the apparatus should have. Okay. Um so I mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface  but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the T_V_  but also devices connected to the to the T_V_  I mean  be able to operate D_V_D_ players  things like that. Yeah. Okay. Right. Yeah  I mean. Yeah  that's true  maybe we should just concentrate on having a a good T_V_ remote  and have it be um have it be like ergonomic so it's comfortable to use  uh simple to use  and looks decent and Sorta find a niche for our remote  like market it to a certain kind of p kind of people  certain certain demographic Yeah  no I think you're right. Yeah  rathe rather than focus on Y Yeah. Yeah. Remotes spinning out from other remotes and having little nested remotes inside. Yeah  that's true what you were saying  I mean it doesn't have to have a flip function  it can just have a lock function  so that it's not uh not usable when you don't want it to be usable. I guess that's good good for now. That's me. Okay. Right. Right. Yeah  it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap. Yeah. Alright  see you in thirty minutes. So we're 'kay? On the or No. I dunno where to put it 'cause the Okay. Could you s take it off?. Okay. Are we free to take notes uh Okay. Okay. So are we supposed to bring the little things for the Mm. Yeah. okay. So my favourite animal 'Kay um Um okay  it's big  it's got a great memory. Supposed to have a great memory  we say an elephant never forgets. And uh dunno know why but looks like nice to me. Nice animal. Okay. No. Really? Oh that's a Not bad I would say. Very good. Mm. Yeah. Is this a T_V_ one we are supposed to make? Okay. T But how do we know how much uh  I mean  how much do we have per how much? Twelve fifty. So do we have to be realistic within the budget or Close pr I don't know how much it would cost. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Um have uh one very complicated one on one side with all the D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ access and stuff  and then on the other side o one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel  program plus and minus  and the just the mute button  for example. I can real keep it really really simple on one side and the other side be very complicated. Yeah. Or grandma as well  you know it's like what is the mute button. No  but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold like you wouldn't be able to press the buttons  but Start breaking up. Yeah. Yeah. Could be really light or  I dunno  something special. Yeah  'cause at the end of the day if it says just T_V_ remote  doesn't say com combination with all all the r Mm. Okay. That's Mm. Mm. Har how it works an Bu Do you think our two kind of overlap  because Yeah. I don't Mm-hmm? Okay. Ooh. Hmm. How do we sta wa how do we start? Does anybody know? So that's this Oh okay  right. Uh.. Hmm. Okay  just hang on a second everybody. I haven't actually looked at this yet. um I haven't looked at it  but let's just start it off and we'll see what happens. If you're all ready. So is the agenda? Opening  acquaintance  tool training and project plan  discussion and then closing. Project aim is a new remote control. It's original  uh trendy and it's user-friendly. Project method  functional design  individual work  another meeting  conceptual design  individual work  and a meeting of details design  individual work and a meeting. Tool training. Try out the whiteboard  every participant should draw their favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal. Um. Uh Miss Industrial Designer  would you like to go first? Yeah  why don't you just c  I think just clip on clip do you have a belt? Or put 'em in your pocket  yeah. Yeah  what's your favourite animal? Is it rude? That's a very good elephant. 'Kay  and you want to write up on there  it says you've gotta sum up your f f your favourite characteristics of that animal. Mm. Okay. Wonderful  well done. Do you want to use the wipe the m the wiper and wipe it off? And Mister aesthetics designer do you wanna go next? No. No. Okay  well done. Yeah. Miss mar Miss Marketing? Um yeah  I think you can just draw the face  but then you'll have to describe in writing how the rest of it looks. That's a very pr pretty cat. Okay  do y do you wanna do some write you wanna just write some words about it? Wow  so they're kinda spiritual. Well done. Okay. Um  I don't actually have a favourite animal  but for the for th for this meeting I'll s draw a little Uh. I honestly can't draw for toffee. Uh. Yeah. no no uh That's exactly what it is. Uh not a very good one Okay  well  you got it's a s It's a squirrel  and I like them  because they're cute and stupid. Right. Okay  so  I guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working. Mm. Let's move on to the next page. Okay  project finance  selling price twenty five Euros  profit aim fifty million Euros. Yeah. Production cost  ah right it's gotta be can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make. experience with with remote control  so talk about who who's used what. Any ideas? Stuff like that. Next meeting starts in thirty minutes. At quarter to twelve. Yeah. Oh k so we're actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now are we or oh okay. I thought this was just t giving us instructions for the re to do next  but Okay. Right  who's got experiences with remote controls then? Pretty much everybody. Um. 'Kay um. W what You want it big do you want it small. Are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that's that's big and Video and ts hi-fi and stuff. Maybe you yeah now th that's the other thing is it's gotta be cheap. 'Cause I I I mean I was thinking something that's got different like maybe a a an L_C_D_ display on it that's got different pages for different devices  but that would p that would probably be quite expensive. Per unit  yeah. Well at the moment we could  wa I mean we 'cause we this is what we th what we're doing at the moment is just saying what what we'd like  and then after we after we've found out what we can like  some different ideas  we can then go and do the research to find out if these any of these ideas are feasible or not. So would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things. Um. 'Kay. Okay  that's. Th that's an idea. Okay. One side for kids  one side for adults. Like it or something like a flip telephone  something like that maybe. F flip it open and you've got all the buttons  or you flip it closed and you've just got the basic buttons on the outside maybe. Um  oh we've got five minutes left. But okay. Well we've got a k we've got a few ideas there. Yeah. I have got I think we should also have a back-up plan of I 'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that I mean we don't  we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything. We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control  that just that is just for a T_V_  but it's just a really good  nice one. What do you reckon? See 'cause  I'm just thinking bearing in mind th we've gotta we have to have something that's cheap to make. I think we'll be able to come up with ideas and stuff a lot quicker. Yeah. May w you know  maybe even Or maybe even so something that's for disabled people or so people that uh b don't see very well or big buttons for touchy buttons for Yeah. Or just one that looks really fucking cool. Otherwise we'll be we'll be here all day talking about do this let's do that n I think we sh I think we should Yeah. I mean obviously everyone we're uh you know uh sounds like we're all a bit sort of gadget heads and we like things that do everything at once  but you know  that's Yeah. Yeah  that's right. Yeah. I mean I'd like one that makes tea as well  but that's not gonna happen. Okay  like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones  yeah. Yeah  it's gotta be sellable. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. No porn channel for children. Okay. Um alright  so we've got some ideas  we've got um Let's move on. Oops  let's close that. Next meeting  uh okay. Industrial Designer um which is Um. Yeah  there you go. So User Interface Designer  that's that's that's you  so you gotta you go  you're you're gonna be the one that's working out what what buttons we need. Um. Industrial Designer  you are the one  you know  you're gonna be working out kind of box it goes in  I guess so  um whether it's what goes into the box  somehow. And in marketing User requirements specifications. Yeah  what Right  okay  yeah. You two you two are gonna be just  I think  you just double up  you know  you working together. You're the one that's gotta go and find out do th do the research  see what people want in a remote  what buttons are used more often  and s stuff like that. Oh  we've been warned to finish the meeting now. Okay. Okay everyone  well done. Good meeting. Yeah. ,The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting. The industrial designer discussed possible materials to use in making the case for the remote  options for buttons  and options for batteries. The interface specialist presented two existing products which incorporate features the team is seeking to embed in their remote. The interface specialist also discussed other features to possibly incorporate into the design of the remote  such as an LCD screen. The marketing expert discussed recent findings from trend watching reports and how to incorporate these findings into the remote design with respect to what materials to use and the overall appearance of the product. The team then discussed other options for how they could incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme into the appearance of their product. The team then discussed other options for batteries  chips  buttons  and materials for the case  as well as the option to have a menu function. 
Does that mean like a wind-up one? A wind-up remote. You could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike  and then people could exercise whilst watching T_V_. Yeah  and stop worrying about the whole R_S_I_ from the remote thing  'cause that's just Yay. Did you say wool? Wood. Oh right.. Yeah  you'll understand why when we get to my presenta. Sony. Sony Ericsson mobile phones has it. Mm. No it's got its little camera in there  plug it in. 'S a Ugly. Yeah  you can't Oh  it's like the iPod. G yeah  no  you can. It's like it's like where you you know how you have your your mouse  and y you go round and i it's kind of like that and you spin round and it yeah. It is You just go round and it is a bit weird at first  but it's actually very like fast. I like the the wheels that click on the side you you get 'em much slower  so it's quite good if you like searching quite a lot of stuff. Do you know  if you're lookin if you're th scrolling through the A_ to Z_ of your music and you're looking for something at T_  then it's a lot faster than the wheel  but you've got a lot less control over it. Okay  I've put the copy of the presentation in um the yeah. Cool. Fabulous. Okay  cool. Um so what I did was to search the internet to come up with market trends and you know what users are gonna be wanting in the the near future. Okay. Right. Now  the first aspect is apparently twice as important as the second aspect  which is twice as important as the third a aspect. So  I mean the the easy to use thing is fairly low down on the which I think given the target group is what you would expect  really. Um  you know  people want something new  something technologically innovative and different  so the whole idea with the L_C_D_s and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like  quite the thing to go for. And um  yeah it wants to look fancy  fancy look and feel. So Yeah  yeah. Mm. Depends how fast your television runs  really  don't don't you think? I mean we've got one of those um Telewest boxes and you put the number in the remote and then you wait and then it goes to the T_V_ and then you wait  and then it comes  so i it actually takes quite a long time. And if you get the number in wrong  then it's a bit of a pain  so I think  you know  a screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that. But like remotes do tend to get f thrown about a bit. You know? Yeah. And i it would be like I mean if you could make it integrate with the T_V_ then it could come up with new information about what's on  and you could just see that on the remote rather than Yeah. But um I think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone  you know  like you have the slidey ones and you have the flippy ones and then the screen's protected so it doesn't actually get scratched. So you can have like what looks like a normal remote control  you know or like a minimalist remote control. So you got your buttons one to nine  your on and off and your volume on that and then if you want to mess about with it  you flip it open and  yeah. Yeah  so that kind of decides your whole chip thing. Okay? Cool. Okay  apparently  fruit and vegetables will be providing inspiration. Sorry  I discovered clip art. Um so these will be an important feature for clothes  shoes and furniture. So I mean  I'm taking this to mean  you know  curviness. Do you know? 'Cause you don't tend to get flat vegetables. You know? Yeah  bit of asymmetry and stuff. But that would be a good way to to get in the whole um R_S_I_ issue in there  because I mean if you think most people use the remote control with their right hand ha right hands so you wanna you curve it so that it's suitable for use with the right hand. Um yeah  I'm not quite sure about the relevance of material will be spongy. Um Yeah  but I mean y you have to Well I suppose you wouldn't get a remote uh an electric shock off your remote control if it was made of rubber. Yeah  yeah. If it's made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there  you could just bounce it up and down. Yeah. Um so yeah  um okay. Yeah  yeah. You have to have a certain element of flatness  I think. It it depends on the whole ergonomics of it  you know  it's like how you put your hands so y it's the least movement basically. No  I d I don't think it makes a lot of difference. I I have one of those s slidey phones and I mean the back is essentially straight  but it's curvy  so. Besides  you have four sides to a thing  so I mean does curved one side mean one side is straight and  you know curved two sides means the whole thing is just a big curvy p thing? Yeah. Yeah. Uh it's it's more about the protecting the L_C_D_  which I think is where it came from. But no  my research didn't tell me anything  which is why we have all the pictures  'cause I had nothing better to do with my time. Okay  cool. Uh combine style with a level of functionality  um beauty and practicality and a thing of beauty and p function. Okay? It's about the practicality of it really  isn't it? You know? I mean if I can't imagine a m wooden remote control. Well it's not very cleanable either  do you know. It's it's not a practical I mean it's it's alright for a table  but for a remote control  you know. And splinters and stuff and It just m doesn't make any sense  I think is the thing with wood. You have to have some push-buttons  don't you? G yeah  yeah. Yeah. I think this is going back to the the graph at the beginning that I made  where  you know  the buttons that people use all the time  you want buttons for them and everything else menu-driven. Yeah. Yeah. G yeah  I would think buttons  yeah. It's it's the I think the thing is  so if someone just wants to turn on their T_V_ and put on a channel  then it should be easier to use than any other remote  and then if someone wants to  you know  change the contrast on their T_V_ and they should be able to do that and it should be accessible  but  you know  I mean most of the time I mean there's a limit to how much the biggest techno geek can spend fiddling with the T_V_  I think is the the the issue there. E either or G yeah. I would say the s the s the spinning goes at a high speed to th to the scrolling wheel  so you have to decide whether you you know  you want to be going so fast or not. But I mean the the thing with this whole if y you're planning on making it out of rubber  on the basis that it's spongy  then I'm not sure how well a scrolling wheel would work. Yeah  but y your spinning wheel tends to go to one side. You want an outside of rubber and then open it up and Or maybe like interchangeable cases. 'Cause I know like we're going back to iPods again n the whole spinning wheel  but I have like a you know  obviously my iPod's not made of rubber  but then I have a little rubber case that goes over the top of it and I can change the colour  theoretically  to match my outfit. Yeah  I think the spinning wheel is definitely very now. Yeah. That doesn't fit in with the whole vegetable theme though. Yeah  but I mean do you think we could incorporate the colours of the company into the buttons and then make the colour of the main remote the colour like vegetable colours  do you know? So you could have like I mean I suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green and some reds and um maybe purple and that and then you'd pick the buttons in company colours to to match with it. So are we discounting solar energy because rubber's gonna be used in there somewhere or If solar panels with the rubber. Yeah  okay  so we lose that I think. Yeah. It's just a gimmick. Yeah  sure j Sorry  do you want me to What does um I_C_S_ mean? Okay  cool. So it's advanced integrated circuits? Imagine it would be inside. So um actually that could like really cut down your thing  so you've got your outside  which is like minimalist  and then you open it up and you've got a screen and a spinning wheel  which you can incorporate buttons into. Um so you've still not got like a lot of stuff in the You've maybe got  you know like if you're modelling on iPod you've got five buttons and a wheel  and four of the buttons are in the wheel  and the other one's the little bit inside the wheel  yeah. Cool  I'm gonna go and sit on my own. I know  I'm hated. I've got a bit tangled up in all this. Excellent. So um I sent you the agenda  it was on the in the project documents. I don't know if you got a chance to just have a look at it. Anyway  it's the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time  so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to. Um and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with  so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts  so that's we need to know about the components' properties  materials  the user interface and any trends that the Marketing Expert has been watching. Okay. Um  do you wanna start again? Let me we've got forty minutes. You haven't made a PowerPoint  okay. Mm-hmm. Let's hope the pen holds out. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. And charging their remote  yeah. Uh yeah. Mm-hmm. For a remote  'cause you Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Wood  wood. A fluffy remote. Huh. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Excellent. Do you wanna stay somewhere near the board  so that if we need to you can sit down  but just we might need you to leap up. What are you  PowerPoint  or Okay. Do you think these pens can give you cancer of the hand? Some sort of radiation? Yeah. Right  interface concept. That's fine. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. It's yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh  hi yeah. It's like the like you said  no? The scroll scroll wheel. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Excellent. Okay  straight to trends  and then we can discuss it all at once. The project documents. Excellent. If you two could both do that as well  in case we need to refer to it. Here it comes. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah  yeah  sure. Yeah. That's over on the interface  if if you could put Yeah. And maybe the L_C_D_ and spinning so that means we need an advanced thing. Mm-hmm. Mm. It it is also quite nice though to to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen  so if you're watching something Yeah. Rather than having to interrupt your viewing pleasure. Mm. Yeah. And then you can flip it open. Yeah  I think so. Yeah. Right. Yeah  and possibly even uneven  like not not symmet yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Something a bit squishy and Yeah  and it'd help if you drop it  it protects it as well. To some degree. Uh-huh. Or if we want to use the the latex  then we have to go with one of the other um power things. From from bouncing it. You can have it as like a little ball to bounce  that flips open. Mm yeah. Uh-huh. Mm. Yeah  'cause the Yeah. Dunno. Nothing to open them. Anything else? What've we got? Okay  so. Looking at what we've got  we we want an L_C_D_ display with a spinning wheel. Yeah  rub off some of those. Yeah  it's not that's not streamlined and sexy  having a having a wind up. I think tha Depends how much how much movement it really needs. Pr presumably if they're suggesting it  then we could use it. I'd I'd keep it on. We don't want that it's no it's not not vegetable. Mm. Mm. Yeah  and given that we're we're looking at more spongy material preferences  I ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Just for fast Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it yeah L_ L_C_D_. Do we need them on as buttons or do we need them as L_C_D_? Buttons. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's what you guys are gonna do next  so if we put down the key um things that we want. Just spinning and not scrolling  I would say. Yeah. Hmm. But if you've got a if if you've got a flipped thing  effectively it's something that's curved on one side and flat on the other side  but you folded it in half. Th that would be on one side  uh-huh. No  I think it's just the casing rubber on the outside. Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Mm-hmm. That's right  that's what they're after. Mm-hmm. I guess. Bananas. Mm-hmm. Green. Yeah. We need the advanced yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. That was the We can't have solar panels with rubber  so. Shall we go for if we're going for rubber  we think uh on as our case  and then Yeah. We've got five more minutes. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah  mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost  then I'd put them in  but if it's Yeah. It's from the company  so Yeah. Okay. And the case is curved on one side  but then flat flat  so it's flipped into each other. Can I pull the thing out the back of your computer? Just so we can Nothing  it's right  I'm just There we go. Uh oh now I've gone too far. Yeah. We're on our way. Okay. So we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery  the advanced chip and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself  um made out of rubber and the buttons are also rubber. We're having push-buttons on the outside and then on the inside an L_C_D_ with spinning wheel  and we're incorporating voice recognition. That's our overall concept  and it's gonna look sort of vegetable  and be in bright vegetable colours. I think it's on the Mm-mm. Yeah. On the Mm-hmm. In the centre  yeah  sure. Okay  so now we've got thirty minutes before our next meeting. In the meantime  the Industrial Designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design  which I'll presume he'll work out what that means. Um the User Interface Designer will work on the user interface design and the Marketing Expert is going to work on product evaluation. And as well as that  the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we've just come up with using modelling clay and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach. Is that all okay? And anyone who hasn't put their their presentation in the project documents folder  it would be good just so in case we have to refer to it. Y ah nobody wants to talk to you. Unplug yourself. I dunno  maybe I would car So what was what was this k ka Okay. Mm-hmm. Um you mean this would be like the the overall shape of the remote control  yeah  mm-hmm. Yeah  mm-hmm  mm-hmm. Mm-hmm mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Um I have some PowerPoint  yeah. Oh. 'Kay. Okay. Okay. Um to be honest actually  I mentioned some some of the things which which could fit on the on the this talk um this time  I m I mentioned them already in the previous talk. So um yeah  this time um I might not have them on the slides but I I can just mention them aw again. Okay. So um I thought um I would also include the definition of user interface um so it's the aspects of a of of a computer system or programme which can be seen uh by the user um and and which uh the mechanisms that the user uses to control its operation and input data. So this would p includes things like shape and size and buttons and um voice recognition as well  and colour  and so on. Um um the method I employed this time was a again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet and then um analyse them uh from the point of view of user fen friendliness and also um whether their appearance was was pleasant. Um and then um this uh this um this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product. So some findings um um. So in in the case of many user interfaces  they're just so full of buttons that it's actually uh hard to find the ones you you really um want to use and um and it's just confusing  it takes y know time to learn. Um okay  and I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found. Okay  some of them are here. Um well the picture is not very clear  but as you can see  there are actu oi  oh oh oh  sorry for that. 'S go back. Ah  no  please. Okay  so yeah  they're quite big and have many many buttons. Actually of the of all these I personally p prefer this one  because it's it's the smallest and and with with least uh with the smallest number of buttons as well. And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice. Um okay. So let's carry on with this. Um So uh um o other findings um some new things um used  uh some of them were mentioned already by our Technical um Designer uh. Our own company has developed a new in user interface uh wait  no this is not the one. Okay  there is a we can uh include voice recognition and um it allows i it's possible to record eighty different voice samples on it. Uh so uh this uh this one was already mentioned uh the L_C_ display. Um s another new development is a scroll button  which was also th also already mentioned. And uh our own manufacturing division ha has uh designed a new um uh programmable speech uh mm sorry uh speaker unit I guess it's it should be. Um and this means that um once uh uh it it it comes together with a voice recognition  but it's once once the mm um gadget uh recognises uh the voice of the speaker  there can be a um pre-programmed answer  for example  you can pick up the remote control and say something to it like hello and it says some hello and your name or whatever. So I mean this is also one of the n dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include. No no  the scroll button is a different thing. I I have a picture if you just a moment  I'll I'll show you. I wasn't completely sure myself  but I think it's just like um it's it's a wheel  it's like not separate buttons. Look  this one here. But I'm I'm not really sure whether whether you can really turn it round  it's like you press this or this or Uh-huh. Mm. Uh Okay  and the personal preferences are pretty much the same as as as last time. It it has to be small  simple. Okay  we decided to include voice recognition  so to have the standard uh major buttons like on  off  um ch the channels and and then um volume and then the rest would be a menu on the screen. Um and I I also thought uh if we want to keep it small and nice um and actually I I quite like the idea of a scroll a scrolling button  I thought it could be for for voice like  I dunno  it mm like on a um i like it used to be on Walkmans or something. There is uh I think there is no reason why we couldn't use something like this for for the remote control. So yeah  that's uh that's it. Yep  yeah. Mm-hmm. So it could be like a rubbery yeah  uh-huh. Thanks Yeah uh-hum yeah. Yeah it's yeah. N wood is I can't n how do you uh I mean you can't keep it really small uh you can't make it like thin and The wood thing. Because you need to you n you need to put all the technology in  so I mean if the case you add the case and it it becomes a bit bulky wi mm-mm yeah. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. U yeah wood is not really yeah. Yeah. Yeah  yeah  in the case of remote control not really. Yeah  but you um I think for for the channel numb uh channel numbers you still need them  wouldn't you? Yeah  so for channel numbers but But I th yeah but I think the L_C_D_ display is kind of yeah  it's faster with a m yeah and w if we dis and when we s um discussed that we might like this flipping open thing  then I mean y you can use it as a normal remote control  but if you do want to use L_C_D_  then you flip it open  but it's it it's more time-consuming. Yeah. No  no  I mean mm we we definitely need the the numbers  because it's uh otherwise people don't want to flip through all the channels. Um Yeah  I would say buttons  because it's yeah. I Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah but n I I'm not completely um completely clear uh I yeah  about the spinning wheel. So I think it it doesn't make sense to have both like a scrolling and spinning thing  it's uh you can al include everything in the spinning if you yeah  yeah  in that case. Ah  but I mean you can Yeah  I um I think so too  I mean the case would be yeah the case would be rubber and the the buttons  rubber buttons  but then Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah I think we um it was a a requirement that we use our um th the colours of our company  so would it be like yellow  grey and black or something  or Yeah  does Yeah. Banana's yellow  yeah  definitely. Mm-hmm. And the buttons as well  I think. Yeah. Yeah  but it it I think it should be quite cheap because it's from our own company  yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Um Uh-huh. So w w would with have the spinning wheel inside with the L_C_D_  or would it be on the outer Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah  okay. Mm-hmm. Mm yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Hmm. So but shall I move away first or shall I stay here with we need to Right. Okay. Right s so I haven't made a PowerPoint presentation  yeah  I I thought I'll use the whiteboard instead. Um mm  okay  so basically I'll start off by uh I thought I'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options and what we can do is that we can start um uh rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that uh are m or highlighting or underlining them or something like that. Okay  so uh I'll start again with a brief introduction to connect that anyway brief introduction to the insides of a remote control and uh then we can probably uh discuss the various components. Yeah. Okay  so w what you see here is so this is the outside of the remote  right? If you open it  you have a circuit board here  right  and this is the chip that I was talking about last time. This basically sends information to a tr uh transistor here  which then uh sends the information to an L_E_D_ device here. If you flip the printed circuit board  and this is th the most important point here  uh everything else is kind of Okay  so if you flip the circuit board  this is what it looks like. So you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the P_C_B_ and uh on pressing this button I a circuit completes  the information goes to the chip  which is somewhere here and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation  which goes goes out through there. So uh the important point that I read over the website was uh that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards uh are quite cheap to make  you can ge get them printed as you want to  so w we can have a configuration um irrespective of the cost  the way we want to have. Right? So that's the important point here  so these are the different options that we have. Okay. So the batteries  I'll start with the battery  right? So they can be simple which is like uh the normal batteries in uh our uh the cells  yeah? Uh thes these are the kind different kind of batteries that the company makes  right? So. And dynamos. Um yeah  yeah. So uh I don't know if even if you want to consider this  but these are the different things that the company makes  so th they'll they'll since uh they'll come internally from the company  they'll be eas uh cheaper  uh all these options. So the third one is uh the kinetic energy ones. Yeah. Yeah  it's a good option. The the kinetic energy one is uh that e uh uh they are usually modern watches  since our hand keeps moving  it keeps the watch ticking. But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control  because it'll just lie there for a long while sometimes. But as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it uh re recharges or something. And the fourth option is the solar cells  which are also made by the company. Environment friendly. Okay um so I'll list things and then we can come back and discuss what what we think from uh everybody's perspective. There are different cases that can be provided. They can be basically the shape of the cases  they can be flat  they can be curved with uh one-sided curved and one side flat  and they can be curved with on both the sides. These are the three options  right? Um Yeah  would it be flat on both the sides  would be curved from one side  or whatever uh there were different kind of supplements available  um like it can be in plastic  rubber  wood  or titanium  right? Wo wo wood. Yeah. Not wool. Oh really? Okay. Um the so uh we can use even um a certain titanium is also used uh in the company to make uh uh some space design equipment  so it's kind of um uh it'll be probably nicer to use  because it relates to the overall image of the company  but uh it cannot be used on a double curved surface. If we choose this  we cannot use titanium. For for these two we can use titanium  wood  rubber  or plastic. Yeah? Uh okay  the interface options now. So we can have push-buttons  like most remotes do and our company is an expert in making push-buttons. Ooh. Uh we can have scroll wheels like the ones on um uh mouse pointers uh uh Yeah  yeah  something like that. So  and they have they can even have an an integrated uh push-button inside the scrolling thing. The scroll plus push. So this is something that has been recently developed by the company  um in the last decade  so not too recent. And L_C_D_s  we can have L_C_D_s. So these two are recent and and this is q quite old. The various electronic options are um uh so th this concerns firs first of all the the chips I I showed you at uh so there's there's a chip behind this one  right? The P_C_B_ is uh inexpensive  so we can put put in uh whatever we want  but the various integrated circuit options are  we have either a simple one or a regular or advanced. And uh the price goes up as we go down  obviously. Um okay  so the good thing about uh wh wh why why we would want to use advanced u why we might want to use advanced is that L_C_D_s can only come with the advanced chip. Um the we need regular or advanced for uh scroll wheels. Right? Um and the chip basically includes the infra infrared sender. Yeah. Uh besides this in electr under electronics uh also the company has started making a sample sender  which is did not explained what i what it was  but I'm guessing that uh so they have a sample sender and a sample speaker. So I'm guessing that uh the sample speaker is probably something like um uh you know  as soon as you press a button  it it mm uh give gives you feedback  one five or whatever. Yeah  on. Um and uh I dunno whether sample sender sender has to do something with voice recognition or not  but anyway. So  these are the different options that we have. Okay  so th that's that's basically now now uh I think that uh we can integrate um uh you know  uh the user interface uh and uh the marketing things in that  keep uh taking out things from this and uh underlining things that are important  yeah. Yeah  yeah  sure. Sure. Yeah. Right. Yeah  it should should do it. Yeah. That's nice one. Mm. Mm. Uh sorry  uh can you go back for a second? Um uh are you sure wha what this means  a spinning wheel with the L_C_ display? Uh oh yeah are th Oh okay  the iPod thing  yeah. Uh it's the iPod uh kind of uh Alright  right. Okay  okay. So instead of going down you just spin yeah  yeah. Uh-huh. Right. Mm-hmm. Right. So maybe I should include that here as well  L_C_D_s um plus spinning. Mm-hmm. Right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. So um uh maybe uh as you're discussing things  is it okay if we just uh keep highlighting things here? Right. So mm uh so it yeah  so probably voice recognition is is kind of important  right? Um and an yeah. Okay  I I have a point about L_C_D_  I dunno if it is the right point to take it up. W uh L_C_D_s are basically for feedback  right  to the user who's pressing buttons  and the feedback can come through television itself  so do we need an L_C_D_ on the remote? Mm. Right. Right. That's true  yeah  that's also Right. Mm-hmm. Mm right. Okay. So now we seem to have a consensus that L_C_D_s are definitely the way to go because of style and Right. You you agree? Maarika  yeah? Yeah. So L_C_D_s  yeah  definitely. Go on. Mm-hmm. Right. Mm. Yeah  we we have we have rubber  but there is a problem that I forgot to discuss with the um with using So if if we use uh latex cases  they won't allow us to use solar cells  as an energy source that is the constraint  so um we could use titanium  wood or plastic uh or uh Yeah  w energy source. Yeah  tap it on the desk  yeah. Mm. So probably double curved surface is the way to go  yeah . Or or curved at one end and flat on the top  because I I'm not sure if it is flat on both both the sides  then ho how much easy would it be to reach for buttons  etcetera. Um Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  singe single side curved or double side curved does not say too much  does it? It uh Mm. Uh I think uh Right. Right. Di now did it say anywhere in your research material about this sliding stuff uh because um according to the information that I have  I think uh the onl only options that we have with the case is are these three. Uh eith either we have uh a flat surfaced uh case or a curved surfaced case. It does not say anything about uh whether technically  you know  this this stuff is available at all. Right  yeah  yeah. Right. Okay. Cool  thanks. Yeah. Let's let's try to r rub off things and yeah  so um hand dynamos are definitely out  right? You you got a wind dynamo  yeah. Okay. Um kinetic energy does seem to have some kind of uh uh appeal  but uh it's Yeah. As against a watch  which constantly keeps moving  this this thing will have to be tapped every time  which which might be very frustrating for the user. Kinetic energy it needs I don't have too much technical information on that  yeah  right. Okay  let's keep it option uh keep an option  yeah. Um the flat co completely flat case is definitely out  right? It has to be at least curved from one side  yeah. Um okay  we still have all all the options. Wood  do you think wood will be a good idea? Mm. Right. Yeah if if it is really thin if it is really thin it it's likely to break  it's it's much more uh Right. That's true. Yeah. Yeah  okay wood is out. Right. Okay  now for the really interesting stuff  the interface. Right  so uh the the push-buttons is is our expertise uh in the industry  but uh it seems to be out of trend  you know  nobody seems to be Mm right. Oh  if if we have L_C_D_ displays  that opens up a whole world  you know  if you have an L_C_D_ display  then mm you can select almost everything on the L_C_D_ display. Right. Okay. Mm right. So uh in in the buttons we have for the channels also we have options. Do you do we enumerate everything from zero to nine? Or do we have just uh channel plus  channel minus  just to just to scroll? The numbers. Right. Or on the L_C_D_ we can  you know Okay. So mm Alright. Right. Okay  so buttons definitely in but oh shall we uh try to draw a prec um Uh okay. Okay  okay  so the components. Right  so uh what about the the scrolling uh? Mm um I'm not sure it'll be a good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber. Uh i it Or or at the corners  edges  just the edges covered by rubber or something like that. Everything else in plastic or even titanium if we want to use it. Mm-hmm. Right  right. Right  okay  so so that gives us a more trendy look as well. Um Right. Yeah  and uh we're going more for the trends than for the usability anyway  right? So I'll rub that out. And uh colours can be provided with the case rather than Um but we still need to te think about the colour of our remote as such  you know  just keep it black  or Mm. Okay. Um okay  if you g go over to uh the integrated circuits. Uh since we're having L_C_D_s there there's no way that we're will be able to um what we do need to consider  however  is that the price is going up for the ever every such thing that we are considering  but since L_C_D_s seems to be uh a definite yes  so it seems to be one area where we would want to spend. So I'll rub off the other two. Oh is oh the constraint was uh yeah. Yeah. So I think uh we'll have uh uh using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one  I mean  a although it does seem uh interesting. But it does not hold any advantages as such for a yeah. Okay. Uh okay  so r we understand this better now that uh the the speaker is for the feedback  right? It it says uh the things that you type in or something like that  so Ye yeah  we we don't have too much information about it  um Yeah  okay  so so th this is in as well then  the sample speaker. Right. Flat on the top. Yeah. Okay. I_C_s? Uh integrated circuits. Yeah. Uh um we we're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as L_C_D_s  mm. Right. Yep. Mm. Mm-hmm. Cool. Yeah  okay. ,The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented two prototypes  one with an LCD screen and one without. They demonstrated how to navigate through the menus and presented the voice recognition and energy source components and the charging stand. They discussed their modular design. They discussed the parental control module and the titanium casing. The production costs were below budget for the basic models. The Marketing Expert presented three important user requirements  and also the fruit and vegetable and spongy material trends in fashion. He then led an evaluation of the prototypes according to these requirements. The group did not feel that the remotes sufficiently met the criteria. They decided to continue working on the design and to take out the LCD screen and voice recognition. They discussed the modular design and its advantages in attracting customers. The group discussed how to incorporate the fashion trends; it was suggested that one shape was used  which could be customized with skins. The Project Manager led an evaluation of the group's experience on the project. The group was pleased with the teamwork and leadership  but one participant complained that not enough information was given about each meeting's agenda. 
Oops. That's as far as it goes. Do you also do marketing? And I'm Christine  and my role in this uh scenario is to be the industrial designer. But I'm not really one. What is the goal of the project? Um no  I I have not begun working on the design  and um I uh I actually didn't know we were designing a remote control  I thought we were designing a new monitor. Um the website I went to look at had some announcements about an introduction of a um uh some sort of a seven inch um monitor  and um I understood that that was the project goal. So um I'm glad I didn't d do any work um ahead of time because uh I clearly didn't understand the project goal. Um I just did s see that we were starting a new project together and there was going to be a four member team composed of these people  and um that's about uh that's and I I read through the different steps  and what my responsibilities were relative to the steps. Uh for the industrial design? Um well  I would th think that depends on how much money you give us. Um because uh  you know  you can uh you can make it uh you have different choices with different financial models. Well  you know um  I kind of think that in general you have to do uh um y you have to have something that's very fashionable  that's uh very attractive that um people see and recognize uh its goal  and uh they immediately wanna have it uh have one of their own. So it would really would need to um something like the iPod would be good  seems to have caught on fairly well  so um d uh you know  I don't care what it does  just so it looks cool. Well  uh I've got a lot of other projects I'm doing right now um and so I'll have to wait and see how those uh how those go. If they uh go quickly then uh it could be a month. If um if I run into any problems in my other projects it might be six months. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And when would you like that? Uh well if uh if we have enough time uh then d do you think um two weeks is a is close enough? Uh are there other people who will be contributing to the plan? Okay  I'll get back to you on that. Would you mind um at the conclusion of our meeting could could you send us a copy of your slides? Thank you. My name is Ed and I do accounting. E_D_. Mm. No. Accounting  yes. Marketing is uh  is me. Well I think that we'll see that throughout the day in how we're going to put this together as a marketing to to market the product. We'll have to see on a through discussion on where we're gonna go from here and from with this. Uh for the moment not yet. Good question. No  this is like I said that we have to be discussed between all of us and we'll go from there. We'll have to simply we'll have to work on it together. Certainly by the next meeting. I'm in the sales I'm supposed to explain them what to do. We have to define exactly what our product is  from uh From what I had in mind we're supposed to be marketing coffee  is that right? Remote controls  'cause I had two different things. I had a first part of mine was to make a remote control for a new f remote control for television  and afterward I had a discussion about coffee so we'll start with the remote control for television then. So we're have to design something that is very user friendly. Something uh visual that has something that will will draw people to buy the product  because I think everybody's experienced with uh remote controls  and some remote controls are are worth uh throwing out the window. Uh th most of them ar I don't know we're have to come up with a new idea on how to make it a lot easier to use  'cause a lot of times uh spend uh half a day through the instruction book trying to figure out how to use it. Well not yet other than uh doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do uh  what they're building  their designs  their ideas  uh also have to pinpoint which market we're gonna go into. It should be a fairly large market because uh the number of people that uh the competition  uh th I agree it has to be something it has to be something new  it has to be something that that draws people saying eh  I like this. Whether it works or not  they have to first say I like this  I like the design  and then it's gotta be simple to use. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Do we already have a cost limit on this  th an idea of how much uh we want to market this for  how much it's gonna sell for  that's up that's up to us to decide  eh? Very good. Very good. No. Uh sure my name is Agnes and I'm an user usability user interface designer. Um I was wondering Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Well  no  not exactly. I mean my job from what I understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable  it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look at the best ways to do that. So I think I'll have to interact with Christine and discuss with her  so that she's not designing something that my studies will show right off the bat that it's not going to work  and so it's sort of it's a loop that feeds in  but I don't think necessarily that I'm in a coordinating position for it. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Which will also feed into the marketing  because depending on what users want  depends on how you sell it  what tag lines you attach to it  how you try to make it more attractive to users. So I think all three groups will need to interact quite a bit. Um  and then I guess build the plan based on all of that  because I think you need to take all the factors into account. Yeah  of course. Yeah  we can C_C_ him on any discussions or documents that are passed around. Sure. No problem. So  the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design  or okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm  yeah  that would be useful. Sure. Okay. Thanks. Thank you. Hi guys uh good morning everybody here. And uh I want to introduce myself  uh my name is uh Shrida Daseri and uh I'm a project manager for this new project which we are going to discuss now. So I want to introduce first of all uh the names and the colleagues here. And what you're uh drawing? Uh how you spell your name uh? E_D_ okay. And? So only accounting? Okay. And? Mm-hmm. Industrial designer. So who is uh marketing  nobody in the market It's you  okay. So thanks for coming for the meeting first of all  and uh we have a long time  just twenty-five minutes to discuss about uh this project and the the project initiation. First of all I want to ask uh Mister Ed about your uh marketing plan and your product plan and uh Mm-hmm but uh do you already have like a functional design or a technical design or Oh for the moment not yet  okay  but uh what's what's your uh do you have some project plan  something with you or Mm-hmm. Okay  so uh by when you think you can uh give me some kind of uh project plan  okay  a discussion with uh By next meeting  okay that will be great. Uh Okay  so there's any questions or uh first of all about uh this project? Uh the goal of the project I think maybe I'll uh hand out to the Ed  okay  so to explain uh what is the project because he's in the sales and the accounting. Yes  so can you explain uh what exactly the product is? Oh I think uh  if I'm not wrong  we're making the remote control. Yes. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And uh what abo uh Christine  what about your uh the industrial design plan? Are you have a design already on this product or uh you're still working on the design? Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. So uh you'll be leading the team for your design team or how many members is working in the team  for the design? Yes. Okay. That's Yeah  but uh before we talk about uh the finance  okay  uh do you have some idea how we can uh sell this product or project in the market and how much is going to benefit to the company and uh of course it's to the individual also. Mm-hmm. Okay  but uh uh when you think you can give me like a kind of design on the functional design or the technical design? Yeah  but uh I need something in the writing  so like uh what's your functional design  what's your technical design  and uh how many people you need for this project  and what's the time frame you're looking  okay  and what is the budget  maybe uh initial budget you're looking  okay  and uh how is going to the market  okay  so you've you've had to meet with the marketing team and how they're going to market and what are the marketing strategic plan  okay  when are you going to introduce  okay  and by the time you introduce the product and uh you know there there would be a competition  okay  so I need some kind of uh uh the plan in the writing from you. Okay  and it's po B as soon as possible. Yes I think uh that would be good  because I need to go to the management and uh tell them what we are going to do  and uh what cost is  okay  and what's the time frame and what's the project plan  because uh without any uh documentations  I cannot go to the management and say  so we are going to do this and we need this much money  okay  so then it's it's difficult for me to say  okay  that's the reason I need uh some kind of plan from you  initially  okay  then we can have the further discussion again. Yes  of course  if you need some help  uh so let me know. So  who are the people you need uh from the marketing or uh the technical side or uh the administration point of view  okay  to add in any documentation  or some technical point of view  so just let me know so I can uh coordinate all the teams. Yes. Thank you. Okay. And uh Ed uh so what's what do you think about uh this uh project for the remote control and d do you have some already planned something for your marketing strategy or uh the sales strategy? Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yes  so what I uh prefer maybe uh you need to interact uh more with the Christine  okay  because you know what she is going to do it  okay  and you know how to sell it. Okay  because uh she is doing the design  but you are the core because you are in the marketing  okay  so because you need to sell and you're the responsible for the all the money  the finance  okay  tomorrow. So  what I prefer  okay  so you need to interact with the Christine more and uh within her team  okay  who is using the functional design or technical design  okay  and uh you need to come up with some kind of plan  okay  how we are going to do the your sales plan  okay  th Th That that's Yes  that's you have to decide  okay  so the best thing is you uh both of uh the Christine and you discuss with yourself  okay  and come up with the cost  and how we are going to compete in the market  okay  in the the technically  or in the sales wise  okay  the commercial wise  okay. Then uh we have to design  okay  how long it will take the whole project  okay  how much is going to cost us  and how much we are going to benefit for the company. Okay  of course it's it's uh of benefit for everybody individually. Okay  so I think it's uh maybe if we can uh give me some kind of your uh the sales plan  okay  including the technical what uh she's going to talk to you within the team  okay  then it will help me to discuss with the management for further  okay  and put it in the the proper project plan. Okay  and if you need uh any coordination in between uh compared to the maybe the some technical vendors or commercial vendors  okay  depends if you want to have some uh uh marketing plan or technical plan  okay  so you let me know. Okay  I can coordinate  or maybe uh  you are my coordinator  am I right? Between uh all the coor Yeah. Th Christine  yeah. Which is Yes. Yeah  so basically you need to interact with Christine more  okay  for the user acceptability  okay  and the testing  okay  then you will Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. But what I request  okay  keep Ed in the loop  okay  in between your uh meeting and Christine meeting  because uh he should know what's happening. Yes. Okay and please please copy all the mails  okay  all the discussions to me  okay  so I need to submit to the management. So any questions for uh time being? Yes. Okay. To come up with the functional design and uh to discuss with Ed  okay  and how it's going to be work  and uh first of all with your user acceptance  okay  how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market  okay  so then we can discuss about uh further things. So  we'll meet when the we'll discuss on the further meeting. It's okay? Thanks for coming. Yes  I will. Yes. I'll copy  uh le let us keep all the emails and all the copies  okay  share each other  okay  so you know everybody what's happening  okay? And if anything you need anytime so please either you can call me  or just send me email  or uh just come and uh knock my door  okay  so I'm available here. It's good? Okay  thanks for coming and uh I wish you a nice time then. Okay  see you later. Bye. ,The project manager opened the meeting and then the industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote along with his personal preferences for the appearance of a remote. The user interface designer discussed the technical functions of a remote and indicated that a user centered approach to designing the interface would be preferable. The marketing expert discussed the functional requirements of a remote and user tendencies in using remotes. The marketing expert indicated that an ideal remote would include an LCD screen  would not be too small in size  and is easy to use. The project manager briefed the team on some new requirements and led them in a discussion in which the team discussed their target group and made decisions on the appearance and functions of their upcoming product. 
Am I starting now? Anytime? Oh sorry. 'Kay  um. Alright  welcome back fro to the second meeting. And um I hope you had a productive last thirty minutes. Um  and um  I'll be taking minutes on this one  and um Being hooked up to the PowerPoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for uh myself  because it'll be more about uh  what you guys are bringing to the meeting today. Um  so  the first presentation we'll be looking at is Poppy's presentation. And  um So  sorry? So  um  take it away Poppy. It's  it's plugged in. So  um No problem. I'm sure it's fine. Right  um  one question. This  um  self-destructible uh metal  it allows for recycling materials? So that  um  someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it  and then once they contribute it  then that company can break down the part  the parts better? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Would we be the company that would break down these  or uh metals? Or would we contribute to another group? Alright. Okay. This sounds like a really great idea. One thing we have to consider is our uh one hundred percent um turnover goal that we have for our financial sector. Um  so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us  cost the company  um 'cause it sounds very labour-intensive. You would have to hire a number of people  and it might be more expensive. Mm-hmm. Alright. We'll still have to investigate the financial implications. Alright. I like the environmental approach. Um  we'll have to see if that can meet our financial goals as well. I'm sorry  could you Those were um Okay. So those are what  um  we'll c construct the remote. Those are all the Alright. Great. Alright. Thank you very much. And  um  the next presenter will be Tara. Yeah. Function F_ eight. Sorry. Yeah. Right. Does everyone agree with this? Does anyone object and  and find the multifunctional might be a better way to go? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Alright. Sounds great. Alright  well  um  are you ready for your presentation Genevieve? Fabulous. Except you're not hooked up to the Great. No problem  we can I'm sorry  what was that last thing that you just said? Mm-hmm. I'm sorry  that eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy. You mean that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control? Okay. Alright  so it might be very appealing if  um  we have very concise buttons. And another thing with um lots of surfing  we'd probably have to work on something that could be um a lot more durable  because I find with um channel-changers that  um  a lot of the numbers get rubbed down if they're printed on the button. Yeah. It's um No it's a button that you press  and then you  uh  like a menu pops up. I haven't used it before but Mm. That's rather sad. Yep. I agree with um if we're targeting young adults then it would be something we should look into. Um  financially and and functionally. Um  and especially if we are um trying to be trendy  go with fashions  things like that. Um  ages like from thirty five to sixty five which show lower numbers probably won't be as concerned. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And something that might further complicate it is that the T_V_ makes noise itself. Wonder if it would have Yeah. Yeah. If we're looking for a simplistic design  if We need to decide if that is our um intention is  is a simplistic design. Um  because if  if it is then I think voice  um voice-activated Yeah  and that would sort of negate the whole remote control thing  because if people can activate the television with their voice then they won't be using a  they won't be talking into a remote  I'm sure. Um  I don't know what an L_C_D_ screen is. I have no idea still. I'm sorry. Oh  on the remote. Okay. Yeah. Right. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And if one of the largest  uh  or most complained about thing is that it takes so long to get to know how to use a remote control  I'm sure that something like an L_C_D_ screen or remote control would be just furthering that problem. Yeah. Alright. Okay. Before we go into uh more discussion on we want this design to look like  I've received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions. Um  for one thing  because Having controls with D_V_D_  V_C_R_  that sort of thing  would really complicate the design of the remote control. Um  we've decided not to include them and make it a specific  just a specific television um function. Which is good as  as we've sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway. Um  for many reasons. So um we have that decision sort of made for us. Another thing that might um affect other decisions is that um the management feels that teletext is outdated  because more people are using the internet now. And so uh we won't concern ourselves with um navigating the teletext option. Yep. Okay  sure. Yeah I do. I'm looking at looking at it right now. thank you. Um  well  I mean we don't have the resources or or possibility of using the internet with the remote control  but um they were just pretty much saying that the teletext would not be used. Alright  and another thing. This is for the design  the design of the product is that um we wanna create  um more of a sense that people know that this is from our company. So  um  all the remote controls must have our um We'll incorporate our logo and colour in in some way. So  um  perhaps um our logo on the bottom  or wherever you feel like it would look good. Um  it doesn't have to be the colour of our um of our company but  another thing is that  um we need to  we probably would have to have that colour and  and logo decided upon. Um  I'm assuming that we already have one  but for the purposes of this meeting I  I wasn't offered a  like a type of logo or colour  so if that could be um somewhere on the design so that we can be recognisable. The little R_ R_ yellow thing? Okay. Real Reaction? Okay. Um  yes  those are the changes. Um  so  now we need to discuss  um and come to a decision on our remote control functions  of  of how this is going to be. I'm just going to look at my notes for a second. Um  we have to decide on a target group and the functions of the remote control. So  um  we already know that it'll just be for the television. It'll It won't have teletext. But um  you know  we could discuss um those other options that you brought up  Genevieve. Is that how most people feel about that? Okay. Yeah  but another thing is that if we're reaching an international crowd  um  I know for one that in North America there is no such thing as teletext  so it'd be really superfluous. Yeah. I don't know about other countries besides the U_K_. Do you know if anywhere else has it? Alright. It was a management decision  so it's  it's pretty much out of our hands at this point. 'Kay. So  I guess we're looking at something rather simple. Yeah. I think we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had. 'Cause I'm sure that could be inex inexpensive because we could use the same kind of infrared the same signal through that and it could just like make a little beeping noise. It's not that expensive to do. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I like that idea. Yeah. The button Oh. Minor detail there. Yeah  it would have t Mm-hmm. Yeah. Then it wouldn't  it probably wouldn't be able to use It would be able to use the same reception on the remote c control I guess  but the actual device would have to have its own infrared signaller. Okay. Maybe  um Probably  I mean. That's your department you'll have to sort that out. Yeah  you'll have to Yeah  you'll have to investi Do some research on that  alright? Great. Um  alright  and I'm sure that  um um  the glow-in-the-dark  fluorescent  whatever  system  um is a go ahead. Is everyone interested in that? Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. But I mean Yeah. Yeah. Could we somehow We could  may  possibly  sorry  incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow-in-the-dark material. 'Cause I d I don't think that glow-in-the-dark material  um  like the actual soft plastic  um  costs that much more than other colours. Yeah. Alright we have five minutes left um  for the meeting  but I think we should discuss this light subject a little bit more before we close. Um  what was I missed the last moment  reading that. What were you talking about with the lighting up buttons? Yeah. Yeah. Mm. So it could be any button that would be pressed. Yeah. Okay  so That's probably feasible. So  do you think that we should do the lighting up thing  and the glow-in-the-dark thing  and the shape of the numbers? Do we have to kind of decide what we're gonna do with this. Yeah  okay. Yeah. Yeah  yeah. And it could  if it's that softer rubber material it'll be  maybe  um  uh  better for people with um els no what's it called  R_S_I_  what was it that we were talking about? Yeah. Yeah instead of like hard buttons. Okay. Um  did we want to go for the glow-in-the-dark look? Or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly? Like should we do both? Or we can have one or the other? Because it might  for  for our design purposes  I mean  the lighting up thing might be better because glow-in-the-dark material has a funny kinda colour. And it might not go with different like face plates that we might come up with. Yeah. Right. Right. Alright. So we've decided on lighting up things. Yeah. Yeah. But with the same thing  I mean. If you touch the button and then it could be  it could be lit up as well. Is Are you okay with that? Okay. Cool. Um Alright. So I think that um that completes most of our um our more uh practical decisions. And now it's up to designing. And um making sure that this can be feasible. And do you have anything Do you have anything to say? Like an iPod or something? Okay. Like a cellphone? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Accessories. Yeah. I think that we should incorporate that. 'Cause that wouldn't be very expensive at all. You'd just get one mould  throw some plastic in it  you know. Yeah. Well  that might be com problematic with um copyright issues. So  if it takes off then we'll  we'll  we'll try that out. Right. We'll have to do more research. Like as of yet  that has nothing to do with  um  the way it'll look. Um  does it need to be reached a de Do we need to reach a decision on that right now? Because we need to investigate the financial implications. Okay. Is it Does it need to be uh decided on now? Or should we Okay. Good. Alright then. Anyone else have anything more to say before we close? Alright  well. Let's have lunch and we'll discuss this later. Alright? Okay. Yeah. That's okay. That's okay. Okay. Okay. Um  do I need to plugged in. F_ okay. Function F_ eight. Sorry about this guys. 'Kay. is on. Right. Okay. I will take this time just to apologise. I  I only  uh  received my emails later on. 'Cause I was too busy carried away doing my own thing  which is not obviously not a very good part of a team-working thing. But there we go. Um  so I was looking at how we're going to go about the working design  and what we actually need to do  and what the remote control needs to do. And it needs to um allow a person to have a portable desi device  so they can control the television from wherever they are. They don't need to actually manually touch the television set. So  it gives them much more flexibility  and allows them to be where they want to be. Um  from Uh  on a functional side of things  we found out that wh from our previous meeting  we decided that there're certain points that will make our product unique. Um  one is the visibility in the dark  which was um Genevieve's idea. So we need to think about how we could bring this in um technically. And we could use illuminated buttons  which we are all familiar with when we're using a mobile phone  or um something fam familiar. A automatically  um lights up at first touch. Or we could use fluorescent materials which would just um take in the light during the day  and then as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark. Um  also we could use um an alarm. So if we lost the um remote control  perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself  which you could press  and then an alarm from the handset would sound where it was  hopefully in the room. Maybe behind a cushion or somewhere. Um  so that would work. Um  oop. Go back there. Um  another thing I think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design. Um  from previous researches I've carried out on other projects  um we've learnt about smart materials where um um specific alloys of metals have a shape memory. So they can be heated and um and cooled  and they change the shape of um the metal. So  for example  a screw that's holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart. So um  the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life  if it was heated  um everything would spring apart. So  all the um individual components could be easily separated  and then some could be reused  some could be recycled  and I think that would be very important for products now. Especially 'cause there's much uh responsibility for all the um companies who are coming up with like new designs. 'Cause all  we all know that our resources are being limited  and we have to be very environmentally conscious. Yeah. Um And then Yeah. Yeah they would  um you would make the  the product as you normally would  apart from the  the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape-memory alloy. And that's the part that would um allow all the other parts to be separated at the end. I mean  the user would return the p product to the company  'cause it's the product's responsibility to get rid of what they've made. Um  and then the company could then just use  make use of this shape-memory alloys to split up the components  and then either reuse some bits  and other bits which are obviously gonna wear out with time  or not usable  they might be like be able to put into scrap metal. Something like the case  if it's scratched or something  you would want to reuse it  but you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else. You could we could probably empl em employ a  a side company or something to do that for us. But it would be our responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we made. For a certain percentage at least. Not every  not a hundred percent of everything we produce  but Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well I the fact of the shape-memory alloys is that they  they don't need to be manually de um deconstructed. Like  you don't have to individually um unscrew all the screws. Because of this  their properties are smart material. All you need is just the heat  so they self-destruct themselves. So I suppose it does need like high contact  yeah  you know high uh quality machinery  and very specific machinery  but Yeah. Okay. Um also there is um components. This'll be how it uh will actually work. But I haven't put this plan together yet. There we go. Sorry  should I go back. This would actually show the circuit diagram. Although I haven't come up with the final circuit yet. So I just put all those components in. Yeah. I it just shows what sort of energy source. It could be a battery  like rechargeable probably. Um  an' yeah  well how the infrared will actually be sent through the chip to be received by the chip on the television set itself. Okay? So  now is it F_ eight again to escape? Or escape? There we go. Okay. Thank you. There you go Tara. Function F_ eight. The one at the top. Um  I was just wondering about the  what  what Genevieve said before  about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing. And that would probably  um  I d  well well what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design. I suppose having that would complicate it a lot more. And limit the design. Do you think? Yeah. Yeah. That's true. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. the single function. Yeah. Yeah that's a good point. It's like the news. Or like information. The and what's on. It's like It's like very basic internet. Sort of  um Yeah  it's just information that um  like television timetables  what's on  what's on now  what's on next  on every channel  and Yeah. To get the right reception and picture  I suppose. Repetitive strain injury. I think. Oh  I'm guessing that's what it is. I'm not Mm. Yeah. Yeah. It is. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. And if there was conversation in the room at the same time  although in theory it doesn't tend to be when you're watching television  but could be very difficult to get the specific uh design. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Mm. What  what would appear on the screen? Like linked in with the teletext  or sort of like an teletext at your fingers  without having to access that through the television. Mm  Yeah. Could be. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Complicated jus complicating things even fo Mm. Okay. Can I just interrupt? Would you like to plug in your Have you got a PowerPoint or not? Okay. Thanks. Were they  was the management suggesting use of the internet rather than teletext  or just avoiding both altogether? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Just Okay. Work on that. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. More research required  I think. But if Was it a management decision that we're having Okay. So Okay. 'Kay. Minimal Yeah okay. Yeah. The same signalling. I mean Or vibrate just the same as a mobile phone. Like you just a  a buzz or something. Yeah. If Do you mean the the link between the Well  if the button was actually on Oh  yeah. Maybe Yeah  yeah. Maybe something adhesive that you could like stick onto the back of any set that would be um yeah not very obtrusive. Obviously something small that's Yeah  that's a good point. Yeah. Yeah  okay. Pr probably. Unless it could be Okay. Um  unless some way  it could have some universal connection to like the socket  the same socket that the T_V_'s supplied from. I mean the power for the T_V_. So  mm  more research into that one. Yeah. Y Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like a raised Yeah That's true. And also y  uh Heather you mentioned before  um like how it should be accessible to everybody. Um  so like big b um buttons  for people you are visually impaired. The glow-in-the-dark or light up won't make any difference anyway. So like you say tactile might be better  because it'd be more available to everybody. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. No  it's not these days. I mean  it's quite easily accessible. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So self-timed lighting. Um  I Yeah. So  self-timed Yeah. Yeah. I think the shape of the numbers is a really good idea. And I think that's un unique as well. I mean  I haven't seen that. And as you're saying like numbers can wear off if they're just sort of like painted on  you know printed. durable. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Repetitive strain injury. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah  and we could Yeah there are now like loads  or a huge range of different colours that it could light up in as well  which could like link in with the company colours. Like it could be blue or green or yellow  or like we've just limited t with the  just ordinary phosphorescent so Yeah. Every time the  that it lit up  you c that could light up as well. Or  or the  whate Yeah. Is Okay. Like you can have changeable um mobile covers or something. Yeah  or Okay. Yeah. Person Yeah. Well  that's great. Interchangeable. Um  als Yeah. Interchan And also possible I mean  uh  we could gain out of that by advertising certain T_V_ shows  or Yeah. But if we  there is Yeah. We could Um  the environmental factor  we didn't bring that up again. Yeah. Um  I've Okay. Let's I think we could probably leave that 'til later on  then. No. Okay. Thank you. F_ eight  w. Function F_ eight. Thanks. Can you see? Do you think Is it uh  function eight yeah? Oh right. Okay. Okay. I'm the User um User Interface Designer. Uh  the technical functions design of the apparatus is the effect the apparatus should have. Um  in this case it's the function of the remote control  which is to send messages to the television  television set. By taking inspiration from other similar designs  we'll try and come up with an original trendy remote control  which is sellable international. There're two functional design options. A multifunctional remote control  which can be used for several entertainment devices. And a single function remote control  used specifically for the television. Sorry. Um  a single function just for the television itself. Yeah. Um  multifunctional controls can be difficult to use  as the multitude of buttons can be confusing. A single function remote control is simpler to use  but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices. Um  I think that a single function remote control would be preferable  because it's easier to use. It'd be more compatible with a range of television sets  making it more internationally sellable. Um  it will make an original design more obtainable  as we have less functional necessities to include in the design. And it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic. And less functions would have to be included. So it would be cheaper to make. And probably more sellable just because it's more compatible with a r a wider range of devices. Does anyone have any questions? Well  it's just that  when we're creating it  we're  we have to make it um compatible with different brands of devices. And it would be easier to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices rather than other ent  yeah  other entertainment devices. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And with this we'll have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design. We'll have more money to go into the design side of it. Yeah. Yeah. It's um It has T_V_ has like information  it has information on holidays  the news  entertainment. No  li Yeah. Yeah. And you have page numbers like for the menu  and you press the page numbers with your remote  and it  it'll come up. Very basic internet  yeah. But you have Yeah. But you have no interaction back with it  you know. Like the internet you can send emails and You've no interaction. Yeah. Yeah. Uh  probably just tuning in the channels  would it be? Tuning them in at the very start. You know if you get a new T_V_ set  you tune in all the channels  do you th do you think? Yeah. Yeah. Repeti Uh. Yeah  yeah. I think it is. Yeah. Mobile phone. Yeah. Yeah. Could it it It would be good if it had the actual programme that was on  and what was next. But that would probably be Yeah. That would be good  yeah. Yeah. Might be quite expensive to do that though. And we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five Euros to spend on a remote control. Like their priorities might not be a fancy remote control  when they're just starting out and  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Early twenties  that's the kind of age group. Twenties. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think it would be annoying though if I don't use teletext that much  but if it was on your T_V_  you'd want to be able to use it  if You'd Yeah. So is it just Okay. Alright. Right. I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. Okay then. Yeah. Would you be able to  um  put the little device anywhere? 'Cause uh isn't our remote control for all T_V_s  so you'd ha Yeah  with the button that you pressed. Yeah. C 'cause then it would only be a applicable to one T_V_ set  so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere  or something. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Would it need a battery then? Yeah. I I like the light up suggestion. I think that would be better. 'Cause you know the way fluorescent lights lose their brightness after certain time  so I would go for Well just the numbers could be embossed  couldn't it? Like raised. Yeah. Could be raised. Just little arrows  that you could feel  maybe? Yeah. Yeah. That  I think that's good  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No  I wouldn't say so. That's good Yeah that a good idea. Yeah. Yeah. That  yeah  that's a good idea. Yeah. Yeah. For visually impaired  yeah. Yeah. If I was thinking though  if it was glow-in-the-dark  you could put the um Real Reaction symbol as glow-in-the-dark  and then it would be constantly advertised. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Oh yeah. Interchangeable thing? That would be good. Yeah. Yeah  and then that would be uh more profitable like as a sideline to the remote as well. Y Could buy extra Yeah. That's a good idea. Yeah. No. Oh yeah. If w No. Okay. Oh  Function F_ eight. That looks right. I'm sorry  what was that last one. Multifunctional and Ch Oh  I see. 'Kay. So as far as we know  um  a single function television remote control is us usable internationally? Right. D_V_D_s and V_C_R_? Okay. Yeah  I think I agree with the single design thing for now  because we're trying to do so much  that if we're trying to make a unique  user-friendly  dadada  and it's also multi also multifunctional  um  we're gonna go over budget for one thing. So Mm-hmm. Mm  'kay. Yes I am. Oh  I'm not hooked up  but other than that  completely ready. Okay. Okay. Oh. I just lost my microphone. Just a moment. Okay. So I'll be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control. Um  and I'll give you a little briefing on what that means exactly. Um  if you all remember from the email we got before our very first uh kick-off meeting  with the coffee machine? The functional requirements of that was to produce hot coffee quickly. Um  so what I'll be talking about now is the equivalent for a remote control. Um  so basically what needs and desires are to be fulfilled. Um  I've done some marketing research  a lot of interviews with remote control users  um  and some internet research. And I'll show you my findings. Oh  and firstly I wanted to remind you about our company motto and purpose. So we believe in providing international market with fashionable products. Um  hence our motto  we put the fashion in electronics. So I think that should be our priority here. Um  and we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design. Not just in electronic fashion. So that it's something that fits in the household. Um  we should be looking towards trends in both clothing and interior design. Any trends that are going on in  in the public  even media  you know who's famous  what T_V_ shows are being watched  um  to influence our remote control. Okay  so the findings. Um  seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly. Which is a  quite a significant number. Um  the other twenty five percent didn't specify if they love them or found them  you know  neutral. Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy. Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user. Yeah  they're willing  they're willing to spend money on a remote control with personality. As opposed to your basic  you know  oval black  all same size button remote control. Um  so it is something that people care about. It's not  it's not ignored in the household. Um  seventy five percent of remote control users said that they zap a lot. Zapping meaning they go through channels a lot. They're you know thumb-masters. Um  and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons. That A very small amount. Thought that was interesting. Yes. And actually to go with that  I'm gonna give you some statistics on the uh relevancy of the buttons  how much they're used. And uh how important the uh users find them. So the power button  obviously  in an hour is only used once. Hopefully the person's not turning on and off the T_V_. Um  but the relevance of that button is nine out of ten. So people wanna be able to turn on the T_V_ with the remote control. Um  as opposed to standing up and turning on the television set. Channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour. That's a huge amount. This is the most important button. Um  so obviously when commercials come on they're changing it  so as you said we want a durable button that's not gonna run down. Relevance of that button  our users found was uh ten  ten out of ten. Uh  ditto for volume selection  so ten out of ten. And it's used on average four times an hour. Not as much as channel selection  but still significant. Um  audio settings is used on average zero point eight times an hour. Relevance is two. Screen settings  which means brightness  colour etcetera  zero point five times an hour. Um  and relevance of one point five. We're getting to specific statistics here. Teletext  um  now I'm not too clear on what that is. I don't know if you can help me. Flipping pages. Is that So like a running banner  underneath Oh. Okay. Okay. Like tells you the weather  and Okay. Right. Alright. Well I guess I'm not with it  because I wasn't But it's  it's being used fourteen times an hour. Um  and has a r a high relevance of six point five. So it looks like something that we're gonna want to do some research on and include on our remote control. Um  channel settings. Zero point zero one times an hour. Relevance of three. Channel settings. P Sorry. Changing the channels? Oh  okay. Yeah. Okay. Um  so it's not used very often  but people still find it relevant. Okay. Um  biggest frustrations of uh the people that we interviewed. Remote controls are often lost somewhere. So that was already discussed by Poppy. How we could have a  an alarm system so that people can find it. Um  takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control. So it should be very user-friendly  you know. People know what to do very quickly. Um  remote controls are bad for R_S_I_. Ah. Is that what it is? People with arthritis and such? Um  maybe our designers can look into that. Um  buttons that don't require  you know  very firm pushing  if they respond. But we'll have to also avoid  you know  buttons responding to the slightest touch as well. That's a problem. Okay. Did you guys uh get that one down? Um okay  here's some ideas for you. A large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls. So I'll show you some numbers here. Um  so the youngest age group  fifteen to twenty five. Ninety one point two percent said that they would pay extra money to have voice recogni voice recognition included on their remote control. Um  and you can see that number decreases a bit with ol s Interestingly enough  twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount. Um  that would  are willing to pay extra. So I guess we're gonna have to figure out what age group we're  we're targeting  and if and if voice recognition is something we wanna look into. And if we have the budget for it. Um  if we are targeting young adults  it looks like something that would pay off. Seeing as ninety percent  over ninety percent would pay for it. Mm-hmm. So that  that's a whole other field of research. I don't know if it'd be  if we'd still have a remote  or if you're talking to your television and saying change channel. Um and depending on how many members you have in households. So it m it may be too complicated for us  but it's something to keep in mind anyway. Right. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. It looks like Mm-hmm. It'd be like the ultimate remote. Um okay. And th the last thing here was a  an L_C_D_ screen. So  I mean voice recognition might be a little too extreme for us. Not practical. Um an L_C_D_ screen though might be something that  you know  you can shift through pages kind of li the way this PowerPoint is working. So that you don't have so many buttons to deal with. Oh sorry  just  just a screen  like a computer screen. S Or like um Yeah. Or Like an alarm clock. You'd have an L_C_D_ versus just a  a normal clock. Oh just like an electronic screen. As opposed to just buttons. There would be like a little  like on Yeah. Like on the top of a cellphone  the the little L_C_D_ screen. Um  now that's  I  I dunno exactly what exactly we'd put on there. I guess the channel that you're on  the v the volume setting. Mm-hmm. Well I guess that's something we can all take back to our respective research. Um  and finally  whoops  my personal preferences and thoughts. Um  I think our priority really should be unique design. Um  we want something that people want in their home. Every remote control looks the same  so uh in my opinion it should be  um  user-friendly and unique. So the other stuff might be a little too  a little too gadgety for some people. Um  I th myself  voice recognition kind of scares me off. So if we're  if we're aiming to make this an international university  universally accepted product Um  and for all  the other thing is like age market. I mean if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds  we could go for the fancy stuff. But if we wanna make fifty million  and and have everyone want this remote control  we should maybe stick to the basics. Mm-hmm. Right. And we have to keep in mind the  the reliability of our research. I mean  you know  a sixteen year old boy would say  yeah I'd pay extra for voice recognition  until they realise that's three months allowance. Um  so I I think  I think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more. Yeah. Yep. Okay. That's it for the market research. Yeah. Maybe we can do the There you go. Oh  come back screen. Hmm. It's probably R_ R_R_ in yellow. Yeah  I think. Okay  so I Are we going to write off the L_C_D_ option? Yeah? Okay. So no L_C_D_  no teletext  and no voice recognition. Yeah. Never heard of it. Um  well I guess  just from my findings it looks like we wanna minimise buttons. Um. And the What was the word they used? F findability is important. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. On the buttons? it doesn't It could it could be a tactile thing as well. Um right  if w if we're minimising buttons  we might be able to make them actually larger. And there's something on it. S you know like up arrow down arrow for  for volume. Um  and I don't know what we could do for  for channels. S The numbers themselves. But then the like up button and down button for the channel  channel changing. Yeah. I just thought that it  it might be sucking more battery power  if there  if it is a light up. I'm not sure. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I guess the other option  referring to the battery thing is  you know how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds or something  when you're s and then it goes  so if  if you're like changing the volume during a movie. I know  I'm thinking of mostly when you're watching a movie you turn all the lights off right. And you don't want to turn on the lights  to turn it down  because there's suddenly an explosion  and it's gonna wake up the baby. Um  so if you touch the button  it kind of reactivates it. It lights up for On self timer. Yeah. Oh  just if it was kinda the same way that a cell You know how a cellphone will light up for about ten  fifteen seconds when you touch a button  after having not touched it for a while. Um  if instead of a constant light up on the  on the remote control  if it lights up for ten seconds when it's touched again. Yeah  and you  you touch it and it just kind of lights up a bit  and it gives a faint glow. So if you have all the lights off in your living room  you'll  you'll temporarily see it. Because usually you're not fooling around for it for more than what ten seconds. So Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Oh right  the Mm-hmm. I was gonna say  Exactly. It the it might be perceived as tacky  glow-in-the-dark. It's kind of like Eighties neon-style. Um  whereas we're trying to be trendy and fashionable. So Mm-hmm. Mm. That's true. What um Oh sorry. Yeah well  I was just gonna throw out there the thought about um personalising the remote control. Um  it  you  'cause you mentioned face plates. So I I dunno if there's something that diff  you know like five different face plates. I dunno if this will start making it more complicated  but it could increase the popularity of the  of the remote. Um Yeah  Exactly  like an iPod. Exactly. Or  or like mobile ph. And I dunno if we'd want to go with like T_V_ show themes or something. Like a Bart Simpson faceplate. But Mm-hmm. Exactly. You could start out with three  and if  if we hit it big then we can add some on. Mm-hmm. Right. Right. ,The Project Manager gave an introduction to the goal of the project  to create a trendy yet user-friendly remote. She presented a long-range agenda for the whole project. The group introduced themselves to each other and practiced with the meeting room tools by drawing on the board. The Project Manager presented the project budget  the projected price point  and the projected profit aim for the project. Then the group began a discussion about their own experiences with remote controls to generate initial design ideas for making the product user-friendly. They discussed grouping features into a menu and adding an LCD display. They also discussed the look of various materials that may be used in the design  in keeping with the company's goal to create fashionable electronics. 
Uh  okay. Again. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Uh  may be better  yeah. Yeah. Oh. Oh titanium is probably trendy  I think.. Well  maybe a little bit expensive. I don't know. Yeah  production cost. I Different colours also. Yeah. Okay. uh Ah. Well  I shall go to the next slide. Um um  I still don't have any information about user requirements. I was thinking about just uh the basic functions and I got uh Yeah  but but then wh I don't know when there are new user requirements. I ha I ha I have the I have nothing. Well  I have here a couple of basic functions I could think of. I dunno if they're maybe a little bit more  but Yeah. Yeah  I I uh well  I pointed them out here  just to make it a little bit easier. Um Another function uh is of course we already discuss it on the side. Um  I don't know what costs of it. Uh  I've no idea about it. Uh  I was also looking for what you said  for I got an email uh uh about uh L_C_D_ in in in front of the remote control. I don't know if that's a good idea  or maybe it's a little bit too much for twelve and a half. Production. If we got already uh something like a base. Yeah  I don't know. I d I uh ju I was just thinking about it. Then I got a pop-ups to go to the meeting. But The remote control. a little uh too A little bit A little bit too big  I think. Exactly. Um  yeah. Well  the functions are are not more to discuss  I think. It's it's just the base things we already discussed that the no V_C_R_ or that kind of uh  so that's very easy. Um Mm-hmm. Well  that's next channel. I mean next channel. Uh Um oh  I I got an email with with an uh a remote control with a base. So  it's uh just an idea. And I um uh thinked of the button sizes and I'm not sure uh if they have to be big or uh just small Well  I'm not a e I'm the expert for user-friendly  but not for trendiness. Maybe it Well uh okay  that's your point. Um  yeah. Yeah  okay. Yeah  I've nothing to s Uh  with a little bit larger  yeah. I thought so  but maybe with the Yeah  that groups. Large? Yeah. Most the most used uh buttons. True. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Uh  that was all y uh personal preference I didn't have. I didn't had any time left. So Yeah . It's there. Yeah  click on it. Couple time. Well  how uh But how do we use uh fruits and vegetables in Christ's sake with remote control? Uh  make it a banana? Yeah  but th yeah  but that Yeah  but that's Yeah uh uh But d don't we need a creative artist or something like that to m make it to feel like a a a a vegetable or fruit? Yeah. But  we we have to um There have to be the the the the firm colours  our own uh colours has to be in it. Yellow  a Real Reaction. Uh  yeah. We uh f A yellow do Uh  yeah. Yeah  and the button then. Okay  yeah. Okay. Lazy. Yeah. Well well what would you display on it then? But is it isn't that a already on T_V_  a lot of new T_V_s? Yeah. Yeah  and we also have to yeah. And I also Yeah  I dunno.. Oh  okay. We can you away. Yeah  I don't know. Uh  uh I i if it's it's a simple p No  that that's right  and uh I also have to think about new functions  maybe buttons or something like that to control it. Kind of L_C_D_ or something or But how does it display then? W when I go to the second channel  what what does it show me? About that programme? Yeah. Is it fashion? I don't know. That's not up to you. That's up to market if i if it's trendy. Because our our motto is we put fashion Yeah  if you want to be trendy you have to be coloured. Coloured If you have black and white or something  or grey  that's It's too much uh maybe uh with with the L_C_D_ and the docking station and With one thing special. Not a whole package of specialty. And uh the Yeah. It's just an it's just an idea. It's a it's True. Well uh I uh Yeah  I dunno. No  it's too much. It's overdone. Democratically. With a spongy Bob feel. Yeah. Yeah  you just can drop it. Yeah. Yeah. But not black I think. Well if if it's fruit and vegetables  it have to be colourful. But can we ge uh uh Can we combine it or something? Uh with uh yellow and black? Make it a bee? A bee. Yeah  it's our yeah. We we have to use yellow. Different fronts. Yeah. Uh  you can you can l uh let choose the customer which colour he wants  yeah. Yeah  Three three or four uh four uh colours  or something like that. Well  yeah  the Three to one. That's And tita uh titanium  is uh is is it a no? Is It's just like that  th this titanium. No  not all  not all of them. Uh  I think titanium nowadays is way more often used than plastic. In trendy things. Yeah. It's cold in the winter. Yeah. You have that uh M_P_ three player of Nike  I saw. Isn't that titanium with a little bit of rubber? Isn't it Is plastic? Well  it's titanium looking. Yeah  he is. Here he is. Uh  the I don't know if you know the M_P_ three player of Nike. 'Kay  uh that that's very uh with rubber  so it's very rough. True. Yeah yeah  true. Yeah  maybe that's good idea  yeah. But if you want to la uh yeah  last longer than two weeks or something like that  you can maybe I don't know. What time does The rubber. Yeah. Uh no  not too much I think. Or you just make uh one colour  uh maybe with a a z a kind of like a big wave or something like uh In in another colour. Not more than two colours I think. It's a g a little bit too flashy. The funct yeah  I was I was thinking about th the st do we still want a joystick idea. Yeah. The volume  teletext and Yeah yeah yeah yeah  b Yeah  but wha what kind of menu? Is uh isn't that different from every television? Mute. Yeah. Okay  that's not mu not much functions. So Okay. Yeah. Too much colour  i it uh when you got it in a living room  it's too much maybe. It has to be Yeah. No. Oh  okay  yeah. Yeah. I hope so. And the other thing is that you don't have kind of prototype or something like that. You see a kinda prototype you can a little bit more uh Yeah. With you laptop? Yeah. Oh my God. Well you are. We're not. Okay. Keyboard work. Yeah. Alright. That's true  I guess. Yeah. Huh. Yeah. Yep. Yeah  that'll be for the future  I guess. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. Alright. Yeah. That's okay. Mm yeah. Then you and then you've got a flag s Very big R_C_. Yeah. No. Next channel  previous channel. I think it depends on the function. Well  if you save uh Perhaps uh s tiny buttons aren't user-friendly  then we wouldn't im implement that of course. Oh  that's right. Yeah. Yep. Those are probably the the th Yes. Those are probably the b four most most used buttons on the th in the remote control. Sorry? Yeah  sure. You don't care. No  sorry. Yeah. Oh. Go away. Come on.. Oh  great. Well  I've done some research again about trends on the internet. Um I've done some investigation  and uh well I uh got some information from fashion watchers from Paris and uh Milan. Some uh some findings the most important thing is fancy look and feel of the remote control. Uh  well  we were going to imply that  so that's nice. The second important thing is uh innovative technology in the R_C_. Uh  our market really likes really likes that. And uh the third point there in this uh order if of importance  the third point  is a high ease of use. And uh  well  for the idea  I've put some trends uh for the market of elderly people. Dark colours  simple recognisable shapes. So we probably won't do that. The younger market likes uh Well  the themes of of this year are uh surprisingly fruits and vegetables and spongy material. I found this image  which is uh Well  it symbolises the idea of fruits and vegetables. I don't see the spongy part in it. But with a little bit of fancy Exactly. I got some ideas Uh well  yeah  pictures isn't really good word  but um some symbols of fruits or vegetables maybe. Uh  catchy colours. Fruit is uh yellow  green  red  whatever. So  remote controls in in catchy colours. Uh  no  we don't want dark colours. No  I just put them there to uh  yeah  uh for general idea. And uh  the docking st uh I think the spongy material is is very irritating for the uh remote control itself. But to Yeah  the To implement some spongy thing  maybe we can do it in the in the docking station. At the bottom of the docking station or whatever. And uh  we could bring one line with a dark colour uh to um uh p uh yeah uh uh v how do you say? Yeah  also a bit for elderly people who are a little bit crazy and want maybe want a little younger design but still the dark colour. I mean it it it reaches a different market uh  but it it it doesn't cost really much effort to b to uh bring uh like a black R_C_ on the market or whatever. Yes. Yeah  there's there's always a Well there there's always empty space of course on a remote control. I mean I think this part of the R_C_ uh well the upper the upper part or whatever is uh is not not used with buttons  I guess. So you you can put some fruity things No  of course not. Especially i Yeah  yeah. Yeah  exactly. If we make it little bit greenish. A and we could use one of these for the uh w what is it? Uh Isn't Wha whatever. Yeah  sure. Yeah. Well  w we can uh w we can we can produce multiple uh multiple things. This is then the uh pear. I don't know the English word  so forget it. And um  maybe  yeah  a b a banana is uh is n not easy for a remote control  but m yeah. Mayb maybe two or three. Yeah. No sure  but but B but that's great  and and and what I was what what I was saying  the catchy colours Yeah. Yeah  uh not really. Pictures was a was a bad word  but Well we c yeah. Yeah  sure. Maybe we can if if we got our docking station over here. I can't draw with this thing  but I'll try. If this is our docking station  we can make our logo over here. It doesn't work. And then Well  the button button over here or whatever  I don't know. On the front  of course  because else you can't find it. Well  that were my ideas a little bit. I'll close 'em down. Um  go away. Conceptual design  yes. The agenda. Well  it's nice  of course. But I don't I don't know what to display on it. I mean Yeah  but it should be li like this big  and I don't think Yes sure  but it it has to to show an entire title of a programme or at least a q a quite quite large part of it and then you get a very large L_C_D_ screen  because Yeah  I don't know. Programme information. But Well a lot a lot of T_V_s indeed show uh when you uh zap to a But then we also uh w need to bring out a line of T_V_s which we were planning to  but whatever. Because the T_V_ has to send information back to the R_C_  and I don't know if that's possible. Yes  yes  o of course it's possible  but you gotta uh implement it in the T_V_s  and I don't think everyone's gonna buy a Real Reaction T_V_ within a month after the release of our uh remote control. Yeah. That's true  that's true  it breaks f yeah  it it it's not very solid  it's uh frag fragile. No. No. I don't think so ei either.. Ah. Bastard. Yeah  I guess. No. Yeah  that's true  if you uh Yeah. No. Well  I think it's uh I think it's pretty trendy  to be honest  uh but um I don't know if if if well  I'm coming back to the costs again  but I think uh we gotta build a b pretty cheap design to to stay within our limits. And I think uh especially colour L_C_D_  which is indeed pretty trendy. But I don't think Uh  I think it will be too expensive. Uh  did it say a price also uh for for uh monogramme uh L_C_D_ or uh coloured L_C_D_? Yeah really  if y if you c i I in in two thousand and four you can't uh put something on the market which is a monogramme. Really. Yeah. W we've we've gotta find a balance  of course. And I think We have a pear. Is that so? Was it it wasn't just a prototype? Exactly  I've never seen it in a store. I think it's a little too much  yeah. Okay. No.. Yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah. Yeah  for the spongy uh feel. Yeah. Yeah  airbag. If you drop it if you drop it the airbag comes out  yeah. Yeah. No. Yeah  b yeah  that's what w I I was pointing at. What? Oh  a bee. Oh. Yeah. Hmm. Well  we can as as I draw really nicely over there. We can put the logo on our uh on our base station. Uh  yeah. And maybe very very tiny on the remote control itself. But  i Yeah. I guess that's that's enough. That's way too Nokia. Yeah  definitely. Just bring more designs on the market. Why not  yeah. Sure. Yeah  that's true. Yeah  I think it I think it does. Yeah  o On the other hand  if you want to make fruit fruity stuff with uh Yeah  that's true  that's true. Yes. Yeah. What? Oh  yeah. Okay  yeah. Yeah  I see. Yeah  but but but Yeah  I th I think that's difficult  because uh that's different material  and then you gotta have like uh uh uh two material lines of of of Yeah  if it's just a colour uh which you uh which you change then  I guess it's it's nice to have one of these. Uh Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Uh yeah  yeah. Yes. New prints on it. Yep. How do you mean? Th th the uh base in a in another Yes. How the buttons yeah. Yeah. No  definitely not. Yes  definitely. No  I think that's too vulnerable. Yeah  but that's that's I was thinking that's gotta be on the television. Mm. Yeah  if it's c if Yeah  I think it's okay to to add a menu button for uh and if the T_V_ doesn't have a menu  then Yeah. Yeah  you can put that on the two eight four and six or whatever. Mm  yeah. A mute and a teletext and a menu. That's all. Hmm. Great. Yeah. Yeah  definitely. Are we gonna do something with the uh spongy thing there? Yeah  that's true  that's true. Yeah  it's kinda fruity  and with th with catchy colours uh uh w Yeah  definitely. Yeah. Okay. I guess so. Yes. Yea yeah. Yep. Something like that. I guess not. Do you  guys? No? In the shared folder. You'll see in you email  I guess. Yeah  I don't know. I don't know. Construct one  yeah. Alright  shall we get back to work? Great. Yeah. Bastard. You lazy Yes. Okay  when we talk about uh components design  um it's really about the material and the and uh uh really the stuff we build uh the remote controls of. Um  a remote control consist of uh components and the components of a remote control consist of uh properties and material. We have to choose th uh these uh wisely and it could affect uh uh a kind of grow of in uh in buying uh the remote controls. Um  the components of a remote control are of course uh the case. Uh the properties of the case  um it has to be solid uh in hard material like uh hard plastic uh with soft rubber for uh falling and and uh uh yeah  it feels uh good in your hand. Mm the buttons has to be uh solid too  and the material is soft rubber. Uh I've got a uh email from the possibilities of Real Reaction. Um uh they're telling me that um when we build uh a remote control of um of plastic or rubber  the uh buttons have to be uh rubber too. Mm It's okay. Yeah. I when we use a rubbled a doubled curved case  we must use a rubber push-buttons to uh the the rubber double-curved case is a is a t uh three-dimensional uh curve in the in the design  which is uh necessary when we want to be trendy. Uh Um the energy source  uh I've got a lot of possibilities for that too. Um  uh the basic battery  which I thi prefer because of its uh its non uh non-depending of of of uh um Uh here you have to have a hand uh yeah  kinetic uh energy. Also in uh this one  like in the watches  but a remote control can lie on a table for a day  and then you push uh a button and so you don't have to uh walk with it all the all the time. Mm  solar cells are also uh a bit weird for uh remote controls. Um uh also the case material  uh I think that plastic is the is the best with rubber  because uh wood or titanium would also be a bit weird. Uh  they don't tell anything about the cost of uh titanium. Um the chip uh the chip set uh and the board is uh all off the shelf. Also  the speaker in the remote control  when we want to retrieve it. Um  the base station is also off the shelf  all the materials and the components are uh just available in uh in our uh factory. Mm  I've told about uh the three first points. Mm  the simple electronical chip uh is is available uh with the LED transmitter uh transmitter. Uh  it's all uh off the shelf and even the speaker and the wireless retriever are all uh available in our company. Um  another possibility. I uh yeah  I looked up on was uh the L_C_D_ displays. Could be uh something special to our uh remote control  and it's possible  but it only cost a bit more  but maybe it can be uh within the limits of twenty five Euros. Ah yeah. I th I got an email with uh some examples and it these were were the most trendiest one. You see uh a covers  which can be Um  I don't know. Um Yes. Yes  maybe we can uh bri uh bring a couple of uh couple of types of uh maybe a kind of uh whole uh um a whole set of uh different uh remote controls. Maybe we can bring a whole line uh with uh with a huge variety of uh uh house uh stuff. Like uh maybe radios and uh television also uh in this in this in the same style  but Yes  because we have to uh we have to we have to bring the logo and all the stuff uh back into it. Thank you. Uh-huh. Maybe we can bring t uh uh teletext to the t to the remote control. But you're the expert. You did the research. It's from your research. Grapes. For a big team of artists. But uh but I think we don't have to make we can't make all uh ten designs. We have to make one design I th I I think. But pictures of fruit  vegetables vegetables Yes  you can put a logo on top of it. Yes  it's really fruity. With a strawberry on top. Only if we Maybe maybe we can make a T_V_ guide on it  for the channel you're on. No  no  only the T_V_ channel with the with uh with uh four programmes. You can uh zap through them with the page up page down button. Yes  it can On your No  on your mobile phone you can y you can read text also. So why not on your remote? Uh  programme uh information or or or or g or a guide on t on teletext  yes. Also on the internet. But Yes  but you also want to know what's next. Yes  that's uh really possible. No. No uh um Y yes  you can use uh buttons uh uh w that are already uh on the remote control for double functions. Uh  then you push a button. The title and the information about the programme. But but uh yeah  what he said was right  about the televisions  they have to be uh customised to the But maybe in future it will be a giant hit  and when you are the first you have the biggest uh Yes  you can put uh a little L_C_D_ display on it with uh with lots of information. But uh I haven't thought about it. But whe but when you put a a a transparent uh plastic uh uh screen on top of it  it i it isn't vulnerable. You can throw with it and When when you put uh maybe a colour L_C_D_ t uh screen on it  it's very special and very trendy to have uh a remote control from But uh I've got a the email with uh with the possibilities. And L_C_D_ was a possibility for the remote control. So why don't we use it. No  but it doesn't sa say anything about a colour or But  mm  I alf I also got a possibility to put uh a scroll button on it. But I didn't think that Yes  but o on the No  when y But it look Yes  but that remote controls are already on the market. The simple Yes  but but when you want to have something special Yes  but you had a picture of it from another company. Yes  it was already made. Tha the remote control on the docking station. Yes  he have a picture of it. Okay. Mayb I will rule the world with it. Yes  maybe a bit of a cushion is Yes. Like a b yes. Maybe it but then we have to look that it uh w uh will not um be too childish to see. Yes  real real good colours. Hmm. But that's not really fruity. Uh fronts of the We can have uh different uh uh fronts of the telephone. Are these designs? Yes. It this a real uh young young and dynamic uh uh styles. Yes. Yes  But also w Yes  b bu but when we use s soft mm Mm. But it it then it uh you can't throw it it. It will uh make a huge noise or break other stuff when you throw with uh titanium with your remote control. No uh  titanium is a bit uh it's a bit harder. But also on the colours  the young Yes  but a titanium remote control  when you're uh watching T_V_ uh or your hands are a little bit sweaty  and the Yes. Sports and gaming. Define. Yes  it's w but it is uh plastic. Yes  w we can do that on the on the We can make this as a style too. Uh  this is uh just a No  we c we can make it from the same kind of plastic. Uh I don't have the information. Uh  I I didn't got it Yes. Like the M_P_ three player. Uh  in a lot of other uh in a lot of other product uh categories like uh even in b in bags industry. Uh  they began with uh t typical uh leather bags  but then they became stylish  with all all si all sort of colours  and w kind of fon of uh of fronts  like we can use on the telephone and it Like Eastpack uh began a revolution with it with all this uh kind of bags and and colours and and Yes  and and styles. They have uh also uh a kind of uh um uh roses on it  a and uh Then we can always uh use the same design for a greater resemblance  but with new uh with new colours  new yes. There there are three uh components three components type. You have the buttons  the the case uh itself  and the rubber and th Yes. Yeah  or or when you use the buttons as black  it you can use two colours as well uh But then you have to put uh up and down and uh left and right Okay. Uh What are we going to do now? I will make one in the next uh twenty minutes. Back to the pen. Okay  all set? Welcome to the conceptual design meeting. The agenda. The opening. I'll again be the secretary and make minutes  take minutes  uh and it will be three presentations  just like the last meeting. So um  who wants to start off? Technical uh designer again? Okay. Uh  yeah. Uh  before we begin it  I want to say I've I've put the minutes of the uh second meeting in the shared folder  but they're still not uh quite okay. It uh it uh still some technical difficulties so the the first part of the minutes are very hard to read  because there are two documents that uh were layered over each other. So But uh  from now on I won't use my pen anymore  so will be p just ordinary keyboard. I think it will will be more uh easy for you to read the minutes. Twelve and a half. Actually What are those  t tooth uh brushes  or so But it's actually kind of uh well  it resembles the design I had in mind for this proj You know the the cartoonish Alessi kind of design. And we can we can steal their ideas. Huh. Well  it's a possibility  too. Uh-uh. Okay. Next time we're here. Oh  okay. Okay. Oh  we decided upon that in the last meeting. Didn't we? Oh  okay. Well  tha I didn't receive any new requirements or somethi Just no  but we decided to use only b basic functions only. Okay. Well we maybe we can think of that later. W just these are the ones you already summed up in the Okay. Yeah. That might get redundant also maybe. I don't know what kind of information it would Yeah. Yeah  it's okay. Okay. That's not It was not a good idea. Okay. No. No. But you do mention the next and previous uh button. Oh  okay  o okay okay. Huh. Mm-hmm. Well  w when we only use basic functions  we have the possibility to make the buttons larger. Well  I think we already agreed upon the fact that the the the skip buttons and the cha and the volume buttons  th th those two have yeah  they have to be large. Uh  I mean th th the the two two basic buttons  you know  the to skip channels and to uh I think yeah  I don't know why  but I think that is that's t trendy too  because that's the mo it it you know  it's uh acc acc um accentu uh  how do you say it? It puts an extra accent on the the on the simplicity of our remotes to j to make these two most basic functions extra big  like t Yeah. And you want to acc accentuate that  you know. So Okay. No uh  that's coo it's cool. Well maybe c then we have to do something with Sponge Bob then. It doesn't stroke with the with the dark colours. Not the dark colours? Okay. Okay. For diversity or something. Uh No  but I I I think that uh our design already resembles so a piece of fruit. It's like a pear or something. No  I don't think you have to do it like Yeah  but it that doesn't have to remind you  you know  like explicitly of s our f of a of a specific piece of fruit  but just  you know  like the the the the round curves. And so y I I think this y it already sem resembles uh something like a pear to me or something. Yeah. You do get the idea  eh? The fruity kind of round 'Kay. Yeah  uh yeah  I don't know. Uh  this is a b yeah. Yeah  yeah. Of course we have uh we have a very big uh the s Of d design team  yeah. Yeah  but It's pear  I guess. No. No  but I think it's it's already what we were were up to. Uh  it's it doesn't have to resemble uh what I already said  a specific piece of fruit  but just  you know  like a fruity thing going on. And it's it looks fruity to me. And uh  but I do like the yeah  I do like uh the f uh to the idea of making a a y uh  a catchy colour design and a d because I do I think a dark colour would be nice too. Maybe it's too much  you know. Okay  but what are the This is yellow. But I don't think our our company colours are this fashionable. Yeah  on uh n uh on the bottom of the remote you can do Okay. Okay  you can you open the conceptual design presentation? See what was on the agenda. This is his own remote. Because um  maybe we can start with the technical uh functions  but I don't think it's there uh  yeah um  do we want to um use an L_C_D_ display  for example? Me neither. Yeah  but it's so I don't think we should do it. Yeah  but no. I do I think it's a bit redundant  actually. And it's also not I don't th even think it it looks s like sexy or something  it's But you're already watching the T_V_  you're not gonna watch your remote control. I really understand you want to make your job more exciting by putting an L_C_D_ in it  but I I really don't think it's a good n goo because it also doesn't stroke with we wanted uh c When we talk about the materials  uh it's a good idea to use these plastic materials with soft rubber stuff on it. It was our idea  you know  to give it a more sturdy look and that you ca like you can throw with it. But I don't think a L_C_D_ display fits in that image. You know  it's like more vulnerable  and it adds nothing really  you know. Yeah  yeah. You could make it  but it's just it it doesn't I don't think it it's coherent with the design we're after. But that's my opinion. Well  you you y Okay  we can vote for it. You want the L_C_D_ display. I don't want to and he doesn't  so it's up to him. If we wanna And I've read somewhere that I've got some kind of veto veto uh rights. So I can also say But did we skip the Yeah  you could do m but what what i so what i but do you think we should We're not even sure what what information we want to display on it. So Nah  that's not gonna work. Yeah. Oh  well uh I've seen it done before. Do you know th like the the bigger rem uh universal remotes  they have d L_C_D_ displays  but then it's very functional to indicate which what uh uh device you are controlling. So it's that that's what I've seen. But it just it j it doesn't doesn't match with the our whole basic concept. Well yeah  yeah  okay. That's maybe not the most important  but it's just I don't think so. Yeah  well do you ha do you have to You haven't looked after the trendiness of L_C_D_ displays  have you? Yeah yeah yeah. Yeah  but we're gonna if it Then uh then you better don't yeah  d Uh uh I really don't feel the whole idea of an L_C_D_ display. I'm sorry. It can't co you cannot convince me. I don't know how well how to with you guys  but I don't really feel it. We already we're uh Yeah  we already have the the th th th base station gadgets  and want and it uh uh  do it has to be a simple design  which sturdy  which soft I don't think I j uh  and really  I don't see how the the L_C_D_ display is gonna add anything  you know  on a design level. Uh  I think it's slicker to have no L_ CEDs. Y we want to it's simplicity  w you have two big buttons and you can do whatever you want with these two buttons  so you don't need an L_C_D_. It doesn't fit in our philosophy uh behind the whole remote. Yeah  but we already have the docking station  which is It has to be developed  but no  but it that's that's our that's our killer feature. That's our what makes it special. Yeah  we're gonna develop our own r n docking station. Uh  but re we really have to cut this off  I re I know you I I I I I get the idea you really like it  you know  the the L_C_D_ thing  but I I think it's it's not a good idea  and we have already mentioned all the arguments. I don't uh  do you guys agre How do you guys think? I d Okay  we s skip the L_C_D_ display. I'm sorry  maybe you can do something if we are at your own place  or make it make it make it happen in your basement or something. But Probably so. Okay. But for the technical part. The m material  I think uh it was a good idea to use the plastic and uh the rubber. Uh Yeah yeah yeah  p Exactly. This is what it w Yeah  but it it was already what we're uh we're after  you know  to give it uh  you know  the soft touch in your hands and also to  know  like Yeah  that is y the b airbag kind of thing. You can st throw it at your little brother's head. Yeah. No no no  not that comfy. Yeah yeah. Yeah. Okay  that's a that's a good point. And that's why I like the dark t col dark colour bit  you know  because it may be the design uh  it's uh maybe it is a bit of the it's a bit nineties maybe  what we're what we're up to rat fun to this point. Yeah  that's that's true  but but it has to be a little big solid. It mustn't be too  n you know  th too overwhelming  then when you put it on your just Yeah. Yeah  maybe so. No  uh I don't like the yellow and black combination. But it is our company colours. Apparently. I don't like yellow  and uh maybe I don't know. But Okay  but what uh  what are other tef technical things we have to discuss? Should we do that? I don't think you we should do that. Maybe just bring it out in different colours  but not af that you can switch fronts afterwards  that's also too much. People don't wanna spend more money on their remote control  I guess. Yeah  yeah. But uh  without gon uh okay. So  are we through the technical part then? Okay. So we uh agreed upon uh n uh well  not u unanimously or how you call it  but Yeah. The materials you uh mentioned in your your personal preferences were all were quite okay. O o only only the last point your no titanium's not not out of question  I guess. But is it possible to use both the the plastic and so uh soft things and t p titanium  as well? Makes it in a homogeneous uh design. It will it will break other stuff w when it's plastic  as well. Yeah. No  but uh uh  you should ma Yeah. Okay  think of the possibilities and make it in completely titanium. Well would it be more trendy? More chic? Yeah  but I I really like the idea of the the the plastic and the big kind of thing. But the question is i then it's  you know  is is it fits in our s philosophy to make it uh sturdy and simple and uh  know  like uh When you make it titanium  it becomes more like some kind of gadget you actually don't need. And when it's big and plastic  it's like some fun stuff you can always have around. It's always fun to have something big and plastic around. Yeah  that's beautiful. Oh  maybe th maybe this is an No  I do like the idea of maybe a t titanium kind type of body w and then with s plastic colouration around it. You know  like the the soft stuff  but I don't know if it's possible. But you can't make the plastic give uh the ti titanium look. But make it just like shiny. Maybe we should uh shou And uh and maybe we sh should we t I don't know if we should talk about uh  how how much time have we got left? Forty minutes. Okay. You putting in different colours. Okay. Okay. Yeah  but w yeah. Well  it is. It's a possibility. But  let's think about the bas Mm-hmm  mm-hmm. But wha th our basic idea y I mean  you gonna we're probably gonna have like two type of materials  like the d d b the plastic uh enclosure and then the the pads that surround it. And and pro and lights. We have to incorporate the lights too. But  uh do w gonna gonna are we going to give it a two-tone colour look  like the the plastic mould is in in one colour and the s the cushion pads around it are in another colour? Is that the idea? Is that a good idea? How many colours are we how many colours are we gonna we're uh uh f uh f Only five minutes left  by the way. How many colours are we gonna give it? Like two-tone colour? T I think maybe the case itself should be in one colour and then the rubber of the buttons  and the cushions as well should be in another colour. Okay  but not more than Well  yeah  it's No. Maybe we should talk about it on a l in a later meeting. Okay. But we have to uh think of some other uh important things. Uh oh yeah  the the functionalities of the the buttons. No. I think this is okay  the so we have the basic. Then we have the numbers. We have the power button. We have we have a teletext button. And maybe want to access a a menu or something. Most T_V_s have a menu. Yeah  but I think you ha I really need a menu button. That's just i the only button only You know  I No  I think most T_V_s have an uh a menu nowadays to access the uh uh screen settings. And so But that that covers all the all the other settings. It covers everything then. No  you can use the And you al can also use the normal skip buttons for that. Th in that way we have like only the numbers  the power button  skip and volume  and then uh uh ten uh rem uh yeah  mute. A teletext and a menu  and then then i that's it. It's all we need. Okay  uh another stuf some stuff about the the the design of the docking station. Something important about a s uh  no  uh which sh uh should remind us of the remote itself  I guess. Uh  in one colour. Just use I think the spongy thing already um comes forward in the in the in the cushions  pads and things on the s uh side. And we will make it spongy and and uh and uh well  the fruity thing is just the shape should be fru i did I think this is kind of fruity  you know. Just round shapes with uh Yeah  but we're gonna have to we really have to think I think colours is very important  because it has to be flashy  but and but it d it doesn't have to be annoying  that when you uh  know  some things is just over the top  and when you have it on your table for more than two weeks  you it just gets annoying  because it's so big and flashy. Uh  it has to be some level of subtlety  but we have to still have to think of how we manage to uh to get to that. Okay. Guess we're through then. But we I think also we just so we have to do something with colour but also  I I think we have to keep the dark colour thing in mind. I think that's uh adds to the too much colour maybe m um But our des design experts will uh work that out. Okay  well I think the meeting will be over within a minute. So we will wrap up. Or is there anything we'd like to discuss? That's right. Okay. Okay. Well  you will read the minutes uh in the you can find them in the pro probably. Yeah uh no  for su for sure because I'm will now type them out. Uh  y yeah. I think uh But toilet paper roll and uh Okay. Yep. I was waiting for the l last message  but Mm yeah. ,The Industrial Designer presented options for each component. He suggested kinetic energy  a titanium case  and rubber push buttons. The group will ask if the kinetic energy component can provide enough energy. The User Interface Designer introduced the graphical user interface to the group and suggested using an LCD screen. He presented several existing products and suggested the following: large buttons; voice recognition; either push  scroll  or spinning buttons; and incorporating some customizable components. The group discussed including a help button; it was decided that it would make the device seem more complicated. The Marketing Expert presented that users found remotes too easily lost  complicated  and ugly. He showed that users were willing to pay more for a fancy remote. He suggested the LCD screen; the group felt that it was better to utilize the user's television as a display screen  but that they would inquire about cost before deciding. The group will inquire about the cost of voice recognition and scroll buttons. The group discussed incorporating a locator function and customization for children. They discussed the sensitivity of the voice recognizer to other noises; the group will ask about the capability of the recognizer. 
Guess I should probably try to sit up straight. Oh  I think mine's fallen off. Wow. Oh yeah  that's fine. Right. I'm Nathan  I'm from California  and I'm here doing a Masters degree in social anthropology. U_C_L_A_. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Wow. No. Sounds nice. Oh  wow. There's more vomit there. Alright. Yep. Um Let's see. Yeah  that's the music I grew up listening to. And so there Something I miss about my hometown. Burritos that cost less than eight Pounds. I grew up in San Diego  but yeah um La Jolla  P_B_. But really uh I last lived in San Francisco  I haven't lived in Cali well I haven't lived in southern California since I was eighteen. It's different. 'Cause in San Diego th the tortillas are cooked on the grill and in northern California they steam them. Yeah  it really does. Mm. Yeah. Where you from in San Diego? Okay. Yeah  my grandparents lived on um thirty second. Close t uh do you know where Clare de Lune coffee shop is  and Cafe Forte Cool. Yeah. Wow. Okay. Mm. Sounds interesting. Maybe our personal coach will have something to say about that. Yeah. Maybe a remote with changeable faces  like the faces that you can buy for phones. Yeah. Yeah. S smaller's better. Simple. Oh right. That'd be different. Yeah. It's gonna be too complicated  too crowded with buttons and things. Needs it needs one outstanding feature to set it apart from all the other remotes. Right. I think  making it out of a nice material would be very important  because so many of those remotes that you see  these universal remotes look so cheap and low quality. Mm. something  uh we'll have to come up with a name  patent it. Leopard print. I think  it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device  maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote. Mm. True. Yeah. I think so. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. 'S true. Okay. Alright. Are you sure I got it all head's kinda small. Okay. We're okay? We're good? I guess it's gonna be hard to drink coffee. Mm. Uh okay. Very official. You're just gonna believe me  we'll go from there. Fair enough. Prove it yeah  okay. Works for me. There you go. I'm Sarah  I went to Michigan  and I'm here doing cultural studies and I'm the Marketing Manager or something. Marketing  yeah Expert. Expert. Fine. That's me. So. So do we have to wait for you to write it down or are you gonna tell us? I'm waiting to know. Uh Fair enough. Oh  Smallville. I went to high school with Tom Willing actually. The guy. Yeah. Yeah. Very much so. Hell of a soccer player but a total bastard nonetheless. Yeah. He is a big guy. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Good call. Interesting. I guess I'll go next then. Okay. Don't wanna lose all my mikes  plugged in here. Okay. This is basically just pen practice huh? Okay. Oh you're much taller than me so I'm gonna write down here. Um. Right now I'm listening to a lot of somebody nobody's ever heard of  Chris Bathgate  local Michigan folk singer  really lame and uh uh what else did I bring with me? Probably classical  to totally geek it out  yeah I think. And my family guy D_V_D_s but we don't need to write that one down. So yeah. No. Are you getting it online  or is it on sky? Yeah  that'd be nice. 'Fraid not. Mm. Exciting. That'd be. Oh. I didn't even read those. Oops. I shouldn't admit that. Yeah. It's the five by five  I can't read that much. Yeah oh it's so horrible. Oh my God. Seriously? It really is Yeah. Slide it in there. Yeah. Yeah fair enough. I've already got more than I can keep track of. And I'm gonna go home next week and everyone's gonna be like oh my God you're turning into one of those people  no. I know. I know. Oh it should be interesting. Wait until I tell them I'm not coming back. They're gonna love that one. Probably. Or at least get a work visa for a while and then decide. 'Cause nice. Of course. Oh  now I can think of so many other ones. That's how it works. Mm. Oh Any thing that are like free. Nice. It must make all the difference. Ah. Right. Mm. There you go. Mm. Makes sense. Uh. What they're looking for. And negotiate that. Uh. I don't think there's any rules about it yet. So Yeah. Mm. W yeah. I like the little cover thingies. Hmm. Good idea. Start your minutes. Um Well it's pretty much given it's gonna be universal right  we decided that already and it may be functioning for other things  as soon as you said that I was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do  like your microwave or your front door or like to have everything on one thing  but then  I've never been a fan of those huge remotes that have like a million buttons  you can't tell what they do. Yeah. Specific. Okay. Interesting. True. Mm. Mm. Right. We want it to be munt multifunctional but at the same time if you get it to do too much you're not gonna be able to tell them apart  that whole yeah. Hmm. Mm. An interesting option. Yeah. Definitely. Right. That Yeah. Awesome. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Keeping it nice and slick  would be important. And I don't know  like  there's such a problem with losing them  that adding this whole like P_D_A_ pen business is only one more thing to lose  so we're gonna have to be careful with what like Just something like keep in mind when we start actually dealing with this stuff but that would be really cool. Yeah. Fi b like what are they called  those face plate things? Isn't there a name for them? Are they? I dunno. Yeah. Something really cool. Leopard print or something. Hmm. True. Right. True. Right. Right. Right. Probably. Good. Mm. Yeah. And that titanium the new silver sleek ones that's last couple of years  very much so. Mm. Right. Right. Mm. Definitely. Yeah. Or if you our users in mind  like these grandmas are not gonna be into this whole new let's design  no it's they're used to the buttons so we'll have to be careful of exactly who we're marketing this to  and who we're gonna be able to get it out of. But Euros. Mm. Mm-mm. Mm. Okay. With half an hour? 'Kay. Perfect. Cool. How're we placed in terms of the alright. It fell That's why. Ah. Sure. Mm. I'm Ron. I uh once upon a time studied in Victoria and I am the User Interface Designer. Go for it. Alright. Think I'm just gonna put down one uh one C_D_. Anybody? No? no? Afro beat orchestra  very cool. Yeah. Fift S they like fifteen members from Brooklyn. Um and I'm hoping to go to the concert in Belgium  in Brussels in April first. Yeah. It's supposed to be in Brussels anyways. Um thing I love about Edinburgh Love um I just came from Glasgow and I'm um happy to say that there's the there's the same quantity approximately. Um. I w Does uh yeah. Ready? Minging? Nice. Uh-huh. Nice. Nice. I assume that we're building a stand alone uh remote control  we can't kind of build it into other uh products. For instance like a mobile phone or something like that. Or or you know can we produ can we sell a remote control phone for twenty five pounds or less? Yep. Okay. Mm-hmm. Nice. Hot. Now are we also discussing kind of our initial ideas at all here? S does anybody have any initial ideas? But I'm thinking I'm thinking kind of P_D_A_ uh design so touch screen design rather than button so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things. Too confusing. Mm-hmm. Possibly. I'm pretty sure there is. I mean I I have a friend who has a P_D_A_ that he just points at his telev any television he wants and it'll figure out the the specifications of it and will control it um so I th I assume that that can be done with uh kind of around the world. Oh. I like the idea of the uh multi plate. In in I like. We should c we should come up with a fuzzy one as well. For those cold winter days. Well if we bundle it as a phone then you can always call it. If you're not doing that then we can have something that just kind of rings from either well there used to be those whistling devices but that's a little bit annoying. Th Yeah. That's cool. I think we could design into that. Curves. We're talking twenty five Pounds or twenty five Euros? Slight difference I guess. No. Thank you. Like that? Okay  cool. Okay? Right  so I'm just gonna start this PowerPoint real quick. Yeah  PowerPoint. Yeah  well  you know . Yeah I kinda like this I'm kinda getting into it. Right. Um. So just to kick off the meeting basically um so we're working now for a real reaction  this is uh so it right. Just got an agenda to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting. Um We're gonna just do a quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another um then we're gonna start talk a little bit about tool training. Essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet  the whiteboard. Um we've got a general plan for the project how we're gonna go about accomplishing this and then just a bit of discussion close up. Um I guess you know game or something um in real life um so yeah basically I want to I'm just gonna you got of course you can discuss that  I'm thinking about um uh proposing that since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask  don't tell. Um so um if you say something about marketing  right  sorted  um y is Exactly. Um I mean obvi if if you guys if if at the same time if you like logically if something doesn't like if I'm like we're gonna sell a remote control that's the size of this paper book you know um you say like well that doesn't seem like such a good idea because of X_ obviously go with it. I mean we'll discuss it but I'm not gonna ask do you know that or uh yeah it seems like yeah yeah exactly so  'cause we're what we're sort of role playing is y g yeah you're gonna tap into your own knowledge as well um. And that's the same for your when we do introductions I mean um and you talk about your background you know have fun  you know maybe you went to um uh you know maybe i you're like in Maine you went to U_C_S_B_ but you wanna say you went to Harvard or something like that  why not  you know you can this is you know I guess we can have a little bit of fun with it. So are you guys okay with that does that seem logical? Sweet. Cool. So I guess that that we're totally we're making a remote control which is thrilling um uh but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model I dunno if you guys had time to check the in real life I dunno if you guys uh checked the um uh the corporate website. Um we've got to make something as fashionable as possible  that's kind of the corporate strategy is we're gonna try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to make it nice you know like John Lewis nice or you know if you go to Debenham's or something. So um basically we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in a user friendly um slick sleek kind of way. Um way we're gonna go about doing that is basically at first we're gonna start on the basics. And that's where I'm gonna need you guys the User Interface Designers and the um um the other designer that I can't remember  the the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ right um the Industrial Designer hey right on alright  getting into it um to guide me and guide us on this project 'cause you're gonna be you're g you guys are the bottom you know you're like no you can't do that you can't have you know X_ and Y_ um at the same time. And then um we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good  you know like um I I think you guys probably got the same emails I did but the idea of um  yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand  or something like that. Um and so we'll work up from there and um then we'll meet on and talk about it and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me tell us what's possible and then you tell us what we can um hope for and what way to go take the the the take the basics and make it nicer and then ov obviously uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible um to try t of sync it all up. So that's the detailed design. So it's a three stage kind of thing. Um right so for now just for th the white board um basically uh just to get used to it  I haven't tried it yet either um I'm just gonna start and um mm carry like five remotes around um and just write down I'm just gonna write down one of the names of my um desert discs you know if you if you were trapped on a desert island and you could only bring five C_D_s along with you name one of them that you could  not all five  if you wanna write all five go for it but name one of them that you could um. Oh  we skipped introductions. Nice. I'm a excellent Project Manager. Um. I'm Marty  um I went to uni at uh U_C_ Santa Barbara and I'm here working on a P_H_D_ in psychology. Um yeah. So Expert Don't play yourself down. Expert Where did you go to uni Nathan? Oh brilliant. Cool. My little brother goes there. Right so desert island discs. Yeah. Well I'll t i no no yeah I'm just gonna write a couple of 'em down. See I'm a big music fan I don't know if you guys are  I'm assuming everybody likes music to some lesser or greater extent but there's some other options  if you're a T_V_ slut like I am like Smallville terrible television show but I happen to love it  it's rubbish but I love it. T the the main c the main character? Wow. Is he a wanker? He looks really tall  like he's gotta be like six six. Yeah. Um okay so I really like Jeff Buckley. You guys heard of Jeff Buckley? Um that's cool 'cause like not very many people have. Um and um oh well I might as well throw a British person in there um you can't go wrong with Radiohead. It's a r Okay so it really works just like a pen only makes noises I think. It's kinda weird. Anyway yeah. Yeah  you're like press and it's. Kinda cool. You'll see. Alright so um whoever wants to get up next  you can write down some telly that you watch or whatever you want. Right on. W Mm. Nice. Okay yeah yeah. Well yeah. Oh  family guy. Isn't h has h do you watch the new season? I think I'm gonna start downloading it yeah. Mm-mm. Afro beat orchestra? Very cool. Mm. Wow. That's what a PowerPoint presentation is for. It's they're designed specifically to ignore. I it's th brilliant. Ah yes yes yes okay I see that. Vomit. Yes. Street pizza. It's so brilliant. I've seen more urine in this city than ever before  I mean It's so minging. Uh. I'm going local. Going local. I have to be here for three years so I might as well get the terminology right. Oh  have you been home yet? They'll be like  say something British  and you're like oh shut up family. Right you s you're gonna stay here? Wow. Bad religion? Yeah yeah  yeah. Well yeah that's why yeah. I miss coffee. Burritos. Oh yeah two two bucks. Where are you from in California by the way? Did you really? What part? Yeah I'm from San Diego as well. Yeah oh man. Going to s like North Carol I'm sorry you you just can't get a better burrito than what's available in the s in San Diego. Well it's it's i there's other things too there's you just can't place it like I when I went to school in the U_ in Santa Barbara which is central California the Mexican food is okay  it's just not good like and yeah it's like two bucks  like literally two bucks for this massive I miss yeah good call on that. Um just literally just metropolitan San Diego  I live like five minutes from the zoo. So North Park actually if you want to get real specific. Yep. Yes. On university  yeah. Yeah it's actually like literally half a mile from my house. Yeah  pretty cool. Small world as we were discussing before. Especially when we're all from the same general region. Right so okay  success on the whiteboard. You can harness the awesome power a little bit introductions we talked about some of our C_D_s and things we like about the city you know  I think we'll Um right so moving on to not fun stuff uh project finance. Um basically what we're trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five Euros. Um. This is what the finance department has told me  the C_F_O_ but I don't know  I'm not sold on this  it's pretty dear  I mean twenty f that's like you know forty bucks for a remote. It would have to pretty much like do my laundry for me. Um so what we can maybe work on that a later but we're gonna make a lot on it  the profit aims to make fifty million Euros on it. Eur internationally. So um one of the things I I was gonna mention to you um you guys the designers is that um it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably. Um so something that could do N_T_S_C_ as well as PAL as well as various other formats like if it's gonna control D_V_D_s but um you know I'll leave that to you guys but that's something that i i it is gonna be an international sold thing. Um but we wanna try to make it for twelve fifty. So we wanna try to make a hundred percent profit on it if we can. Um s right so um just to close up  I'm not sure how much time I've used mm next time right Project Manager  sorted. Um. Is uh we'll meet in another half an hour or so um and I'd like the um Industrial Designer to get ge think about what needs to be done  like what the basic function of it. Um U_I_D_ well yeah you right g your assignments are up there and you'll also get s assignments from in your email as well more spec specifics on what do do. Um mm basic and um so I need you to tell us what um we what the user's gonna want. So actually in a way you guys c maybe in our next meeting chat a bit about what the user's gonna want and what the user can have  you know like uh so yeah well it is and we'll discuss the trade-offs in between um so yeah specific instructions will be sent in your email. But I think that that is more or less a good place to start for now um and as more things come up we'll have meetings and you'll get emails and so forth. Um any questions  before we get started? You mean to like Hmm. Yeah. Well  have a think about it. I mean I'm I'm certainly op it seems like yeah it it seems like it's certainly do-able isn't it. I mean um or if we can't have a full mobile phone maybe a remote that has some other kind of useful function. The clapper. No I mean no  good idea  good idea. We'll see what see what Uh-huh y I like that Yeah. That's true  I guess we we probably have some time  maybe we should brainstorm a bit like what we wanna do  go back to um I don't really have any. Let me bring up something about our basic goals here  what we want to accomplish. Uh project announcement. Ts ts ts Yeah. Not so much. All right we'll find them  we're on our own. Yeah yeah let's do it  let's do. I'm gonna go ahead and take notes on this too 'cause Yeah I mean oh yeah right. So initial ideas. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah that's slick isn't it. I mean like stylist yeah like a just a yeah. Right so we got five minutes more to chat about this  perfect. Um so we've got this kind of an idea of a trade-off between um uh size and functionality. Um and we also I'm also gonna note for future reference this idea of um so you like maybe like an L_ like a touch screen type of remote? I don't think one exists. Be a good idea. Yeah all the other universal remotes. Um I don't know if there's such a thing out there  I guess we could do some uh do some research on or one of us could do some research on it about whether or not there are um multi-format like um you know PAL  N_T_S_C_  region one Okay. Okay. Interesting. Okay. Okay. Okay. Um all right. So. I li I'm liking that idea  this idea of a touch screen remote with multi-format features. Um. Um. Let's see. Mm. Uh let's see. Um. Yeah yeah okay. Think they're just called face plates? I don't know. Um. Mm. But if we're bundling it unless we're selling their telly with the remote. Um Cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing that comes with the remote that you could place something else that you press and it makes the remote page. Kinda like how on a lot of um uh cordless regular phones  you have a page button and it goes  could we do something like that? Um yeah I think this material quality as well like I guess what we can think about what kind of um uh you know Apple 's been really successful with this surgical white kind of business or this sleek kind of you know Yeah. Yeah. We do have the minimum am amount I mean we were talking finances I dunno  selling a a forty Pound remote would h or a forty Dollar remote  twenty five Euro remote would be pretty you know it's pretty expensive so maybe we might wanna trade off some of the features for a lower price. Without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargain store universal remote that's black and you know m massive  some kind of I dunno a balance there in somewhere. But um have a think about what we can do  have a think about what we want to do  how we're gonna sell it and um Mm. Twenty five Euros. Yeah. They're all weaker than they're all stronger than the Dollar. Although  computer parts  all if you're gonna upgrade your computer  buy it in the States. Like um do you guys know Fry's? Huge computer uh electronics store? They serve um right they sa tha s they will sell things overseas so you can buy stuff in America and have it shipped over for like twenty thirty Pounds about. Right so um let's go ahead and wrap that up here for now  I'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the um project documents  so if you guys wa need a reminder about what we've talked about um the different you know kind of trade-offs that we've got and the other ideas  you can consult them at your leisure. And uh right so thanks for that. Let's just uh head back to work on what we were talking about bef uh goi h h getting into. Um. Yes. Thanks guys. ,The Project Manager went over decisions from the previous meeting. The Industrial Designer presented the prototype and discussed its look  its internal components  and its interface. The Marketing Expert evaluated the product according to the initial product goals. The group then decided that enough of this criteria had been satisfied for the project to continue. The Project Manager presented the final cost of the device which exceeded the initial projected price point. The group decided to remove speech recognition but to propose to the management that it  remain in the design. The group then discussed their effectiveness as a team. All members felt that they interacted well and that they felt they could be creative. The Marketing Expert felt that the market-research based approach would help the project's success with consumers. The group did express  however  that the budget was overly constraining. The Project Manager instructed the group to fill out a final evaluation questionnaire. 
Good morning  Flores. Marketing Expert. Right. For the cameras Alright. Geez. You have the same message of uh Windows cannot um sen oh stand-by. Close the the window. So That's right. Ruud. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Alright. Okay. Progressions. It's for the vision. Yeah. Sensors. But we all use the same white-board file So we can work together on it while we're or should we only use it in the in the meetings? Yeah  okay. Yeah  alright. Yep. It's a bunny. But of course  Flores. Blank. Yeah  I'm think about it too. Format. Well  it looked more than a bunny than a cat  but it works  right? With a very small legs. You should feed that uh that animal. Okay. Okay. And for a cell phone? Yeah  okay. Yeah. But Yeah  but the infrared  it's uh  well  a little bit old-fashioned  if you would call it like that. But all the T_V_s are uh equipped with infrared  so y you you can Most of them. Or you shou sh use a you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well  I had a few uh things in mind. Um well  the interoperability  just like uh Sebastian said  um the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different uh um Yeah uh  what is it  devices? Um so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store. It's not for uh for uh for uh Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product  right? Yeah  I do I don't know that. It's no I have uh don't have the information for it. No  okay. Yeah. Um Well  the techni fu technical function uh what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_. That's just the basic f technical function. So that was my really my part for uh this session. Um Well  that's just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do  wh what is his task uh as an uh as an uh device. It just should change the T_V_'s state. So that's it. Um but furthermore Yeah. Yeah  with buttons. Yeah  or maybe you want a touch-screen or But Yeah. They're very vu vulnerable. Yeah. Yeah. And for other user interface I had um  well  it's more industrial thing. Uh point at a T_V_  I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_  so you must point everywhere  so maybe infrared is Yeah  just don't even point it  so in that case infrared should uh maybe uh be restriction to that. Yeah  if you g if you go to radio or or yeah. For T_V_  you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_  so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that  but if you want to uh get it working with a radio  and you're in outside your garden with just one uh speaker  then maybe the range should be uh But Yeah. Two more things. Um You should able to feel the buttons without uh it mis um you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons  so it should be as user interface um for feeling should be uh good to understand. You must feel the buttons for volume or whatever  I think. And of course you don't always know where all buttons are  so it should be visible al um in dark too. So when it's dark Those are two really uh user interface Yeah. That's perfect. Yeah. Yeah. Well  maybe I um but it it can be quite simple  you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it. The uh the the digits in black. Uh then it's already visible in dark. So it it don't have to be a lightning or or a fancy well  it can be for design  of course. Just remind something. The digits of uh the the painting on the buttons should not fade. You have a m uh Always have s the soft buttons  always uh clear the the the paint on it. The marks. Yeah. But um Necessary  yeah. Yeah. But then Bluetooth uh might be problem. 'Cause I think Bluetooth uh Yeah  I know it from the cell phone. But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time  twenty four hours a day. Does it It's over? Okay. Great. Okay. Good morning. Okay. Um green. An animal. Okay. Um Uh a wee rabbit. Yeah. Yeah  I think I think they're right  yeah. Uh I think most most things have already been said  like uh control multiple devices. And uh  yeah  infrared might be an issue. Uh well  he said about n abo what he said about pointing. But uh lots of devices already use infrared. So we'll probably have to implement that. Yeah. Good morning  Mister P_M_. How are you today? How was your business trip to Boston? Is there a schedule for this meeting? I shall close the door. That's correct. Okay. Um is there any room for a little presentation? Uh maybe during the discussion uh section? Okay. Alright. I'm just uh guessing what should be my favourite animal. Well  I'll give it a try. Mm. Very good. I was very good in drawing. Well  I guess you uh get the idea. Beautiful. Yes  um I have some technical uh issues which I would like to present to you uh before we start the discussion  because uh there might be some uh influations influences. Okay? Okay. Um first about my role  role of the Industrial Designer. I would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things  and the technical possibilities and impossibilities. So if someone of you comes up with uh ideas  uh I'll try to translate them in technical functions  but uh there might be some impossibilities. So that's one. Uh I also will propose some uh um uh some implementations for that  but well  these are quite the same. Sorry about that. Um and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product. I have some uh initial ideas about some things um which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming uh discussion. One thing about uh interopera operability. Um I think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device diverse subset of equipment. Uh for instance  uh D_V_D_ players  cell phones  video and audio equipment. So one re uh one remote control for all your equipment. Well  there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them. I think it could come in handy. We should discuss that. Um and we should think about the way how these things uh should communicate with each other. We're not uh living in the uh nineteen eighties anymore  so infrared is not uh is not really uh hot uh technical stuff anymore. But you should uh think about the things like uh Bluetooth. Mm-hmm. But it's cost-effective. Yes. Mm-hmm. Well  not all  not all. So that's the point. So Maybe  but that's uh something we should discuss and uh about every everybody should think about it. So that's just my role  I'll just uh give you uh everybody some technical input  and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what uh the product should be and how it should look  but take these things into account when you start the discussion. Yes  so one thing uh one remote control should uh control one or more uh pieces of equipment  and the way of communicating with these equipments. Okay. That's it. Yes  I think it should be something like that. We're not developing this product for a specific vendor  are we? No  we're just developing this product  and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public  so it should fit to every device. Yeah. Mm-hmm. And you you see uh the buttons as a as a means of doing this? Or are there any o other controls? Are there only any other cont Well  I I've seen these remote controls with uh this little stick uh which you can move forward  sidewords. You know these things. And um it's very easy for a user to to switch w yes  to to switch b uh between uh channels or uh change uh between tracks on a on a C_D_  on on a chapters  you know  on a D_V_D_ player. So maybe that's an idea  I don't know. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Uh is that uh are there restriction for the range  the operating range too? So when you're not able to point at the device um the range is very limited. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay. Do do you Um well yes  I had  uh about three minutes ago  but I've seem to forget them forgot them. Um oh yes  I remember. Um you said something about visibility in the dark. Um uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control  on which you can see functions? Which makes it easier to operate it. I I don't know. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Yes  but there's a cost limitation too. Well  that's more So that's a big problem  I think. I think the the financial part of this project uh implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product. The cost price is very low. Um Okay. Very good point. Yeah. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Hmm. It's use uh a lot of uh well Well  cell phones have uh integrated Bluetooth also and  well  it's it seems to work uh quite okay. So uh technically it will be possible. No  you cannot. Okay. Okay. G good morning. Oh yeah. Are you ready? You should put the laptop uh right into the square. For i for the cameras  yes. Good morning  Sebastian. I'm fine. Um well  actually I didn't go  didn't feel like it. So Do you want to open it as read-only. Um I guess I should close it here. Okay  the waiting is for our Marketing Expert  Ruud. Um project kick-off. Yes  there is actually. Um I will li list the agenda for today. For this meeting. Good morning  Ruud. Uh it's important um yeah  great. It's important that the laptops are um exactly on the square  um for the cameras. Okay. Okay. Um we're here to develop uh a new product. Um I'm sure you've had a mail from our account manager about it. Um and um this is the first meeting to to generate some uh uh some ideas about it. Um you are here in a specific role. Uh Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert  Roo is here as the User Interface Designer and Sebastian is here uh in the role of Industrial Designer. Is that correct? Okay. Um we're going to do um uh uh a little tool training uh for the tools we are going to use uh during uh the meetings we are going to have here. Um then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan  uh and we will have a discussion. Uh this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes  so we should keep that in mind. There is? Yeah  there is. No problem. Um okay  this new product we are are g are going to develop  um it's a remote control  a television remote control. Um and first of all it should be original  it should be trendy and user-friendly. Those are kind of easy um uh uh goals  um and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop. Um we will discuss uh later on more ideas about uh how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things. The market  we should have a look at the market. Um we are going to use a a pred a project method uh during uh this development  um which consists of three different design stages. Uh the functional design  the conceptual design and the detailed design  um all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual work  prepare  and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh the the the progressions  yes. Um the first stage  the functional design um we are going to search for the user requirements  and we will um make a specific uh specification of that. Um the second is the technical functional design  um what effect should the remote have? Well in this case control t the the television I think. Um and the last one is the working design. How exactly does it work in the technical sense. Um the other design stages  uh we will discuss that later. So we'll kop it keep it with the functional design. Okay  um before we think about remote control we will um work with some of the tools we have uh here. Um as you see now I can give a presentation. Um it's also possible to use this one as well. You can uh uh display pr uh two presentations if you want to. Um to um presentate  to show us uh a file you'll need to uh place it in your project documents folder  which is on your desktop  at least it should be. Um then we have this electronic white-board system. Um yeah  I will show that now. Um you can draw on the board using this pen. There are little um uh sensors  so do not grab it here  but a lit more a little bit more to the uh to the end. Um well  it it's on the um eraser now  so we click the pen button. Okay  so not too fast writing. Um you can insert a new um slide or or white-board uh uh file um by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button. It's quite the same. Um all our um whi um uh SMARTboard um notes should be kept in the same file. So do not m make a new file. Just use this one uh during the day. Um you can use the eraser to make something go away. Yes. Yeah. Yeah  in the meetings  only in the meetings. It's really like like a regu regular whiteboard. Um you can choose the format  um sorry. Uh Let me see. Um Well I guess it's maybe because I'm not s uh pen selected. Yep. Current colour  you can choose another colour. And um for example black  and you c I can choose the line width. Um so now I d have a different line width and uh colour. Okay. Quite easy  if you uh do have any questions  just c ask me. Um to um oh well  I'm I wrote down the documents uh should be in the project documents folder if you want to uh discuss it with us. Um as a little training um I will ask Ruud first to draw uh uh your own animal on a new slide uh with uh a different colour and a different line width than the one uh now selected. A rabbit. Okay  well great. Um Roo  could you do the same please? But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width. Sebastian is thinking about the animal. Okay. It it should be a cat. Okay? I'm guessing a horse. Yes  okay. Beautiful. Okay  so um you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to. Um any questions well  just just let me know. Um okay  back to our project. Um the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros. Uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros  which is quite a number. Um we uh we will focus this internationally  so the product will be sold um  if there is market uh interest  uh in in more than one country. And um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve Euro fifty  so we should keep that in mind by uh w w during the development  um because uh  well  those are important numbers. Um then the discussion  maybe the time for Sebastian to show his presentation. Limitations. Okay. Okay  great. Yeah. Okay  so the the main por uh the main points you are uh telling us are focus on the inter uh operability  and Okay  and and uh Okay. Okay  good. Um that was your presentation? Okay  okay. Um okay. Great. Um I'll go back to my own presentation. Um Mm. Okay. Um I I do think it's time now to to discuss uh mm some things. Um Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications. Um there are other things like um how to make it trendy  which is I think uh um most uh Ru uh Ruud's uh role. Um the way how it should be controlled by the user  which is uh Roo uh r uh during this part. Um so let's start with you. H how do you think the remote should um function for the user? Yep. Okay  so we're we're going business to consumer  not we're we're it's not a No. No. Yeah. Uh Ruud  y do you agree? Okay. Okay. Yeah. So is that ease of use or uh is that more like um Okay. Uh-huh. Maybe not even pointed. Yeah. Okay Uh Okay  gentlemen  um uh just a reminder  we d we have five minutes left for this meeting um okay. Okay  s yeah. Yeah. Okay. Uh I'll write down glow in the dark. Is tha Okay. Okay  um uh I just want to hear uh Ruud's um input for this meeting. Um do you have anything already w um ab idea about how the market uh will respond to the such a product? Or what we should take um in account when developing such a product? Mm-hmm. Because? Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay  Sebastian  did you have any other ideas? Okay. Yeah  yeah  okay  because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product. So Yeah  twelve Euro fifty  yeah. Okay. Okay  okay. Okay  um I ha I have one point f um which which comes in mind now. Um uh d I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily um or it should not consume too much um power. Because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every s uh uh every other week. So um maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or yeah. I dunno  it's uh that's more Sebastian's uh um Well does it? I'm not sure. Uh Yeah. Okay. Gentlemen  I'm afraid we do not have any more time. Um so we will go back to our own uh work. Um next meeting starts in thirty minutes and um  well  you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it. Um so this was it. See you in thirty minutes. ,The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting and two team members presented their prototype and discussed the features the prototype contained. The team then looked at the production costs of the remote and had to decide which features to retain or lose in order to maintain the target cost. In maintaining the target cost  the team had to lose a number of features which they originally wanted  such as a kinetic battery  an LCD display  and various color options. The team then evaluated the prototype on the basis of its appearance  technological innovation  and spongy quality. The prototype did fairly well in the evaluation. The team then conducted an evaluation of the project process. The team felt that their creativity was hindered by the project budget and their inability to discuss the project outside of their meetings and that the structure of the task did not foster teamwork. 
So we are here to talk about functional design. Now hopefully we've all got a better idea from than we did f leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now. So here's an agenda. Uh I'll open. Um you should know that I'll be taking minutes during all the meetings  as I was struggling to our last time uh and that'll be easier for me now because I'm not actually giving the whole presentation. Uh the additional points are just the stuff that we sent and that I forwarded on from upper management having a few bright ideas to make our lives painful. Um now you can all give your presentations. We can talk about the requirements and hopefully come to some decisions. Right  forty minutes for this meeting  so a bit more time than the last one. Here's the additional points I just wanted to put those in there to see if you guys had any comments on them. Uh did you all receive that email? So does anyone have any overall Mm. Mm. Yep. Mm. Well tha that first point could uh also be an op opportunity because in seeing that teletext is becoming outdated  some sort remote control that can work with the Internet there is the opportunity that's presented  I guess. Okay. Okay. Yeah. but but we are sort of being dictated that this should only be for the television. So we're quite fixed. So we're really probably  in terms of marketing  are looking for that's uh that's a cost winner rather than a fantastic new feature product. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. But there's also the potential for mark there's a market here for our lost teletext. For example someone that just goes to the shop that wants a replacement wants it as cheap as possible. Twenty-five Euros is the selling price  we really have to innovate here I guess. Mm. K yeah. Mm 'kay. Okay. Okay I think that the last point is probably quite uh straightforward. Obviously the the w it has to be branded. 'Kay. On the product yeah. Can you handle that black and yellow? Mm. Nah. So we have three presentations  and I think we'll go in order of participant number here. So we can have a look at the working design first from participant two. That's Okay. Mm it's enough. But uh click it on off? Do we have an idea of costs of different components? 'Kay. Mm 'kay. Do we have any ballpark figures for that yet? No. 'Kay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Thanks. And we have participant three  which I believe is Pedro. I can give you that to click on. And you wanna get View a slide show  that's what you wanna do  yeah? Just go up to view. Mm 'kay But I t I think what the the management recommendation was less that there's a worry that teletext will become outdated rather than we shouldn't have it. So I I still think if it's cheap enough functionality-wise to include  it really should be in there. Because otherwise we're just going to I mean even if it's necessary or not  if you if you're given the choice between a t a remote with teletext or without uh when it really if it i if it isn't more expensive for us to k make because as far as I understand it  it can be operated with the same set of buttons  yeah? So it should be in there. Yeah. Okay. Isn't Well maybe what we're getting into here is the the idea of uh Internet through the T_V_ for example. So that might play on what we can do. Well you have digital T_V_ still already. Well there there is a for example on digital T_V_ systems you have you can press a button and you can buy things in adverts  and you can uh you can view through a catalogue for example. A a family member of mine has got a system where you just um you can Yeah  and there's other features for example on other systems where you can pause live T_V_ and things like that. They're just features from the Internet uh from computers are are coming into the T_V_ sort of under the covers  but you still use it through a teletext. So now the things to think here are that that there's gonna be more functionality  potentially that we can handle. Mm. But still there there's an opportunity. If if it's  for example  a trainable one then we're just simply having like an up  down  left  right  an okay button or something like that might might do as well in future proofing it. Mm. Okay. Yeah  and neither do I in fact. Bu uh. I'll communicate that back to those guys there a a and th the message really we wanna be sending to them is that  although teletext may become outdated w there's no l logic in not having it in there anyway i if it doesn't affect the price. Um but I I think what they're pushing us towards here is in terms of thinking of ways to future-proof our system for future systems that have something else other than teletext maybe. I dunno I'm Mm 'kay. Mm. Yeah. Hmm. So if we're keeping it basic we're loo loo what we're looking to sell it basically is it's uh just being very easy to use  looking exceptionally good  that sort of thing. 'Cause we really don't have anything else there  do we? Mm-hmm. But i if design if design is cheap and functionality is basic  then twenty-five Euros is probably a high price for a commoner garden stan standard T_V_ so the place uh remote the then the place we're going to justify that cost is through through design through making it a a sleek elegant high-priced basic remote. Does that make sense  huh? Mm. Yeah we probably should. We we're doing alright for time. Yeah. Okay. Sorry that kinda cut into you there. Mm. So we are looking for something that looks good and just works  rather than looking for any special features. Is that Mm. But we can talk a little bit more potentially in the marketing marketing presentation about this. Be a good idea. Uh sorry  I didn't mean to cut in. I'm not the boss. Okay. I think that's probably a question more for for this guy here  yeah. Is it? Okay. Mm. Hmm. Okay. I have a question uh for you. Does any of the um the features that Pedro's spoken about here have any implications we might not have thought about on in terms of just pure functionality? In terms of making it work or the cost of that or Okay. 'Kay. Cheers. Onto participant four. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. Now the the question is can we make this for less than twelve-fifty per? We we well do we necessarily have to change the end cost because uh Can we dl can we do that without uh changing it twelve-fifty per product  if we basically can sell more based on this? Mm-hmm. Yeah we we can certainly push for a more expensive product if that's gonna be Nah  I think we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. And and th to get to back to another point  sorry uh uh for cutting in but  I th I think it's important to remember that that this remote has to work with multiple T_V_s  yeah  'cause it's selling on its own. It's not going to be specifically for Hitachi T_V_s or or whatever. So technologically  if I understand it  uh T_V_s T_V_ remote's working exactly the same way as video remotes and D_V_D_ remotes. All you need to do is train them to the individual one  all you need to do is is know the the f like some four-digit code. So saying that it works with all T_V_s is equivalent to saying that it'll work with D_V_D_s and other things. Oh okay okay. We have done this. I see. Mm-hmm. And I I'd Mm sorry. So we really can't chase that. We're really looking for something basic. The the one thing that that that you said really struck a chord with me here in that we're we're carrying the corporate identity with the product  but we're actually looking for a large profit at the same time where I'd be inclined to go back to upper-level management and say like let's just cut down our profit expected on this product because we are actually branding our company here. We're selling more than just the product. We're trying to get mind-share about uh Real Reaction to to the people who are gonna buy consumer electronics. We want people to eventually say  oh that's that's Real Reaction that's a good m make. It's reliable. And and we're gonna make it we're gonna win mind-share by uh either being a fantastic product or for it working  it just being good  reasonable-priced  and solid. So if we can make if we can put an emphasis here on it not breaking I think that's in itself an extremely big thing. We only have a few minutes left. Is twenty-five Euros a mid-market price for a remote? Okay. Okay. Well I'd be inclined to say  if we can make the design better than any comparable remote while reducing the cost  then that's the way we really should play it. If we can take it down to you know fifteen rather than twenty-five and make a low profit-margin on it  but we're really doing that to sell the brand. Yep we have five minutes left. Uh rather th uh to to to sell for Real Reactions. And I can communicate this to to the more senior uh mm people within the company here to to get a reaction. Well how does everybody feel? I I think The other the o the problem with that in my mind I just think off-hand as a as a consumer  would I wanna buy that? And I think maybe not because I've got a remote and I'll take it to different chairs  I'll take it to different I w I don't wanna go over somewhere and put it down. It i if it is gonna be somewhere that you put it down then it needs to be at the side of your armchair  and that implies that there's only one T_V_ user. So it's very good for some people but it's not a like But it it takes away the ease of use of the remote to a certain extent. You have to l sort of remember. You have to d shift down the side of the couch to find it and put it back and Yeah. I d I d I d I think it it in my mind it doesn't seem like something that oh I'd really want uh because of that fact. But I I don't know  that's just my opinion. Mm. 'Kay. So what do we think maybe we should Pedro  do you have any opinion on it? Really need to wrap up now. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. I mean there's al there's also remote controls I remember that that worked uh  this hasn't been done in a while I think  but th as a as a watch. Yeah  there is remote control watches um  but I think they're a sorta eighties thing  so it might not be easy to market in it uh but the the technologies came along and it might be cheaper to make now. Those things may have been inexpensive for all I know. Gotta cut up. Mm. The last remote you'll ever buy. Well if if we're going down that then we can we don't need to go the it it strikes me that the locator feature might actually be uh quite expensive to make. Whereas actually just putting it in a power cradle might not be too expensive at all because that's just done with mobile phones you can just n we we have said we have actually similar products that we can take from and potentially cut costs there. Um need to look into whether we can do that but uh I think we we have some m mobile phone-based products uh checking quickly our Internet. We really need to finish up here. But uh Yeah we have the the power-adaptor products. We sell power-adaptor products. So for example there's nothing stopping us using that technology. Yeah. Yeah I think so  without it being too In fact we can cut costs through using the manufacturing that's already gonna be in place here. Okay. Yep. 'Kay. Thanks guys. Yeah bu but we we're designing only the remote  we not design the T_V_. So uh we're gonna be removing the teletext out of any T_V_ that we people use our remote with. So it's kind of a stupid decision. So then the double R_ will be our our I tho I tho I thou I think Rol Ro Rolls-Royce might mind  but don't worry. Yes. I Hey mouse. Open. When we're fighting over it's also more lot more fun. Uh. This doesn't work. So yeah function design. Um you guys know me  Pedro  and um what I found is we want to do fashion and I think  honestly  we should keep technology low and just simple basically and try to aim for design. If basically a case will will cost the same if it looks good or bad so we ma we have to make it look good. Um something cute and small. The big chunky remotes are died in the eighties. So we should just go for something that people will like to actually look at. And um although mo most people will buy s televisions and everything for uh that have loads of loads of little functions and everything and they mostly end up using simple functions and little things and most the people won't won't get too mad of actually having to go the to the s to the television to  for instance  tune in their the stations. There's no need to have that in the remote. So um um as for what I would recommend for uh the the interface design  and uh I will change the colours on the on the logo  but um we should go for the user-oriented device  so simple controls and good ergonomics. Um and uh although I th I th I'm still here recommending the teletext so I'll remove that  I guess  but um we should go for the Yeah. Yeah the they're basically aiming at saying that you would use you know a couple of years ago teletext to be the easiest way to check like for uh uh the scheduling and the next programme and stuff like that and now Yeah and now you can c look it over Internet. But I still think teletext is way more convenient until until we have the same commodities. Yeah  but it's not happen yet. Yeah. Yeah but we we don't we're not aiming a command for that. That's the thing. And all of those require the other commands with more complexity and more software and Yeah but we would increase the price to try to make it a trainable one  so Well I dunno. One way the other teletext was there but I guess we can remove it or  you know  make two separate interface designs. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah but we're not putting some there's no no putting anything in in the place of teletext. That's the problem. Yeah. No just I I would I would advocate for continuing teletext and those would be the basic commands. Um as for  you know  the the case design uh maybe I'll come up with more concrete ideas. Right now it's just the idea of simplicity and slickness  cute and small um Yeah. Yeah mm. Mm-hmm. But we th that should be design. That should be the design basically. I think technology we'd we we're not in the price range to do it. We don't have the money to do it towards t f technology so we should we should aim at design. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah y y you you wouldn't The interface will be different. Good design. Uh we should keep it simple  mm medium-low cost mar um cost area and uh make it look good. Yeah  complicated but Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah they are not simple. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Well uh what comes up for me is that if we're gonna if we're gonna be marketing a product that is going to be uh having no teletext  people are very comfortable with the idea of having teletext and using teletext  and so we're not we're gonna be a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now. So that's  from a marketing perspective I I see I see a lack. And so we have to go  I think  in the other direction. What are we gonna have that makes this thing better than Right. Yeah. No  I I agree with you. So what I'm talking about is I see that one side we're eliminating something so we have to come up with another side which is  what are we gonna be targeting our market uh that identifies our product as better than because it doesn't have teletext it has ta-ta-ta-ta-ta. So that's that's that was my reactions. Yeah yeah. Yep. Okay. Yeah. 'Kay. That's right. I think we take with you. That's what I'm that's what I'm talking about is is that we have to find something that is gonna be very attractive about this product 'cause somebody  some people are gonna be hap unhappy 'cause it took they can't ac access their teletext. Okay. 'Cause we're talking about eighty percent or ninety percent or ninety-five percent of the televisions out there are are teletext. So so it's it's not that I'm criticizing the product at all. It's just when we eliminate that then what do we bring? What are we bringing in to take the place of this  and we have to d in my opinion we have to double up. If we lose one we need to bring two or three. So you have this? Now is would this be considered just a standard uh um This is not this is not cutting edge technology we're talking here. We're talking about existing technology. Nothing is being modified or upgraded or new discoveries. Okay. Okay. N okay. Mm. Mm the shell? Okay. I have maybe a silly question. I in the very beginning it said with the with the advent of computers there's gonna be the it's gonna be out-moded teletext. I I don't understand how those two things are connected. How does how does computers and teletext h how why is one eliminating the need of the other? I don't understand that. Okay. Yeah 'cause  yeah  I just I don't see the cross-over between computers and television. I mean I do see the cross-over in some sense  but but but but with the the remote is is used for television  okay. So so if we make the cross-over and we're gonna view television on computers then we're then we're losing the the necessity of the remote. S Okay. Okay. Yeah I don't I don't see the logic. I I don't see the logic in elimination of teletext  I just I I but I'm not a tech-mind either. I just don't see the cross-over between computers and and and 'Cause we are designing something for a television  okay. We are selling it to an existing market. That's Yeah  and and  yeah  and and we're also marketing a product. It's what I'm seeing is a is a mid-range cost product. So so w we can't go and pump a whole bunch of technology into this thing because all of a sudden we are gonna have cost overruns. So if we drop if we are gonna choose to drop teletext  again what are we adding to the product that makes it marketable? I don't I don't see it  and to me if I'm gonna market a product for b for beauty for for design I'm gonna I'm gonna try to market it at a much higher price. I need to make it special with a high price tag. I don't want to make it economically uh g uh competitive. I want I want to market it as exclusive. So I would market this product it at eighty-nine Euros and come up with some really beautiful exterior design or something th but but I don't think we have that flexibility. No I no I I understand what you say  but what I'm what I'm  okay we probably need to move along  but my my concern is trying to find a marketing niche for this product  and if I'm coming in with a with with twenty-five Euros  which is mid-market price  um then what am I going to give these people for this? So that's just my question  but we can keep talking. Yeah. Oh P Pedro  I just want to say quickly I I would really like it when you can come up with some more bells and whistles  eh. You know sell uh things come to my mind is uh uh something that's uh um voice-activated. I know we're getting into some  I hope  some big money on this thing  but Is that for over here? Okay  alright. That's 'Cause uh and I think of voice-activated I think of of how many times I've I've lost my my remote and I can't find it. So some way that I can I can find my remote by clapping my hands or something uh and and so so um But this 's just something. I'm trying to find some bells and whistles 'cause when they talk about tel taking out teletext  it's like  what are we gonna put in? What makes this thing attractive? And it's only for televisions. So we everyth our our competition out there has got these these multiple adaptors where they can use 'em for their V_C_R_s  their D_V_D_s  their their televisions and we're coming out with one remote for television only. And so to me we have to make this a really special product I I I don't s I really have to say I don't see the market niche for this product. At this price I don't see it yet. I'm I I go along with this  because this is what we're given to try to market  but I I don't see the market niche for this product without without some really sort of something really special to identify it as as unique in the market. Yeah. Okay. Have to do you have to do it in the box? Okay well  so so that's up to you then to to make this box in something that's absolutely extraordinary. Maybe make it in the form of a gun. We can sell it in United States. Well you know for marketing f marketing for me is uh and uh how do I go here? Okay. Go go. Is that right? Ah-ha. Yeah  what for me is it um I d I don't know what I'm marketing right now  okay  'til you spoke and when I wrote this  I don't know what I'm marketing. I just know that I I was identified as a a we identified ourselves as a as a developer  as a manufacturer  and as a as a um distributor t to other wholesalers. And so the th the twenty-five Euros that we've identified as the sale price is a wholesale price rather than a retail price. That's what we decided here. Um so what I did is I I decided that that this this needs to be a product in a in a sense can market itself. So what we've identified here as our main marketing stratagem is is in design. We're making the most beautiful attractive uh whatever we decide it is. So that means we have about seven more minutes or ten minutes left. Um so I would like to have a product that that we can sell easily. So I say inspiration  so having something beauty  something attractive  uh something that in a sense will sell itself. Uh innovation I think fits into what we're talking about here with design. Uh cutting edge technology  I don't think we're gonna have that  these were ideas I was putting together  um unless we come up with some New Age product a as far as the casing is concerned. I I wanna make this thing something that I can identify as special in some way  so maybe we can have some I I talked about environmentally sensitive  uh maybe we have a product that can be identified in some way as advantageous in a home. I don't know. These are just thoughts. Uh I wanted to talk about uh who we are as a as a corporation  that we're new  we're aggressive  we're competitive  we're we're trying to provide a product from a new perspective rather than from an old corporate line. So to me it's about selling d uh our identity our corporate identity along with the product. Um what I found is that the projected costs are competitive. Uh we're kind of in the middle of the market  but what I'm seeing is that the market is ready for I I identified new technology  but again  because what I see is budget restrictions and limitations  I don't know that we can bring any new technology into this thing. If if we could have a technological something Mm p please. Solar. But solar Blah  I like it. I like the idea  but we're talking about in cost is gonna probably double. But boy  we can sell this thing  because there's no batteries  it's environmentally sensitive  i we can identify it as a safer product in some form. Yep  that's right. I really see But the cost i No no. No no  we have t we have to change the end cost. There's uh I mean I don't see it anyway. Yeah  that's gonna be up to these guys. I my reaction is no  but Well  see I I see I I'm an advocate to make this an exclusive product. You know  let's let's sell this wholesale for for fifty Euros  sixty Euros. Let's make this thing really exclusive  environmentally sensitive  uh high-tech design  uh ergonomics  all of this. Just make this thing uh  yeah  the the the Rolls Royce of of remote controls. Every home's got to have it. If you don't have one  hey what kind of remote do you have? Oh you've got one of those  oh fantastic  I want one of those too. I just don't have enough money right now. Yep  one one thing I don't understand is h they've they've given us this package  okay. Now uh in my opinion we need to give them a package back  okay. They say they say okay here you go. They gave us a fundament a foundation of of what they want  and and w it's our place to kinda analyse and evaluate. I don't think it's our place to create their product for them  maybe it is. I don't know what kind of role we have in this in the corporate ladder uh  but to me it's like  okay  you have got your here's our ideas  okay. And then let them look at those ideas and they say  yeah well  we can we can raise the price twenty percent  you know we like this idea  this idea no  but to me it's it's about a choice  do we follow their directives or do we make uh presentations back and and then and then discuss? beca I I do not I do not see the market niche for the product that they're handing f handing us right now. I don't see it. Right. No I understand that. Nope  they've identified the product as not working for anything but televisions. They've identified this product limita That's why I say I don't I don't see the market niche for this. If we if w if we were going to have a product that worked for D_V_D_s  V_C_R_s and everything  then I can see the market niche  but we we're only identified as going for televisions without teletext. And it's like whoa we ha in my opinion we have to go with something that's extremely exclusive to make this thing marketable  because who wants just a television remote? I don't. That's right. I I I have a tendency to agree with you. I really do. That's why I say I quest I q I question the marketability of the product. I really question where we create the demand. W okay if you if you drop the cost  now if you make if you make go to the other side of the cost scale  and you make it less expensive  then all of a sudden now we're going into an a a new market area. So we can say low-cost uh uh um uh good design  beautiful  wa-da-da-da-da-da. But what I'm saying is right now we're middle market. Yeah for for multi for a multi-function remote  that's a mid-market price. In a discount right now you can buy 'em on sale sometimes for about about uh eighteen  nineteen Euro  and that's for the multi-functions  uh D_V_D_  V_C_R_  uh catch-alls. And and they have 'em in a little box in the middle  and and this is the consciousness that most people have about replacement remote controls. So to me  to market this a t only a television remote control we have to change consciousness. We have to have something that will change people's thinking to identify this as advantageous  and I don't know what that is. It's gotta be low-cost or high-cost with with special design features. Or my d I mean I I well we g we're talking about the other end now. I like it. I like the idea  but we have t we have to find out Well. Mm. Well  I think again it's it we have a cost issue here. You know if we're gonna go in this direction  to me we're going to the other side of the cost range. Are we gonna make this selling selling the cost as a high high-tech uh um environmentally sensitive whatever  or are we gonna go to the lower side of the range? Again I don't see our market niche in the middle for our product yet. I don't see it yet. W a question I have in in a 'cause I I I think I agree with you on  we gotta make it a box. The box is gonna sell it I think  the outside  the casing. Can can can we have multiple designs? Have a modern  have a traditional  have a you know  and so so instead of them all looking the same  people can have maybe four or five different designs they can choose from. I don't know what that creates cost  or Yep one over another. Yeah  okay  I hear that. What ab what ab what about a a remote that's that doesn't maybe look like a remote? Just an idea. Just just okay 'cause I mean we all know what a remote looks like on the outside. They're selling these things everywhere. Maybe that could be part of our design exclusivity  is we make a remote that doesn't even look like a remote it it opens like a telephone. Doesn't matter  yeah. I'm just jus I talking about some something to make this thing unique. It That's the thing  I'm gonna keep thumping on. I'll sell whatever you guys design. I don't have a problem selling a product  that's not the issue. I give you ideas  you guys create the product. Once you have the finished product I'll find a way to sell it. Don't worry about it. I just give you these things now  because these are my thoughts and feelings. No no. One thing I just thought about when you were saying that  is that the p our target market is gonna be someone who has lost or broken We gotta stop? Who's lost or broken their their remote. So how many remotes do they wanna buy? Can we p can we sell them a remote that can maybe guarantee they will not need to buy another one? And so with with with this kind of system or locator or something  to to think about  how have people been been losing or breaking their remote? How does this happen? And and then and then design the product  maybe some component of the product that can identify this as the last one you'll ever need to buy. uh we can make it in the shape of a coffee pot. It's uh just it's that I think it's telling us to stop our meeting. So we have the c we probably have have on-line in our in our system  we have the ability to create this  we're talking about. A charging system. If if we can create this we have probably five or six or seven really strong marketing characteristics. No that's not what I want  I want Oh look it here. Yep. Right. I think one of I think w  yeah  one of the things that we should also keep in mind um when we're doing this I mean our company's slogan is we put the fashion in electronics  right. So I think our kind of our target here is to have some kind of very like sleek nice look remote and we want it to be functional as well  but I think one of the main selling points is that we don't want it to be clunky like like this thing here. You know we don't wanna a big clunker. We want something that looks nice and it's fashionable and so That's fine. Okay so so you all know me  I'm the Industrial Designer. And we've some basic components that um our remote is gonna need  just basically every remote'll need 'em. We need some kinda of power d power source. Um we have to decide on our our user interface  which is his department  but the in user interface is also a major component. Um we need a programmable digital signal processor to um to take the input from the user and translate that into uh into electronic signal  which we pass to the infra-red L_E_D_  which you aim at the television uh which and it receives that signal. You need a on-off switch um I don't know how that got in there. And uh we also need to um have the if we want a universal remote we need to have encryption codes for the different makes of T_V_s. So we need to know all the different you know all the different signals and so that'll require some memory as well. Um so here's just a basic layout of how how the remote would work. You ha the v the power source is in the upper right-hand corner there  and you can see that uh we have the user interface here which is connected to the chip which does all our signal processing  and then passes that signal on to the infra-red L_E_D_ and that signal is then emitted and received by the television at the photo-transistor. So those are the basic components that need to go into this and everything else is pretty much uh open to move around. I think any des No. Right I think Yeah this is just this is just a basic layout of ev of all the components that w w are gonna be absolutely necessary f to have a working remote. We can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition  I mean that I mean that you can kinda say would would fall under the user interface and the digital signal processing chip. But Um well the most the most costly components are gonna be the chip and the uh th it could als basically the user interface and the casing are gonna be expensive as well. Um the L_E_D_ and the the transistors and everything else are you know they're they're pretty cheap. So depending on what we want our functionality to be  um the chip could be expensive or it could be cheap. Um depending on the n amount of memory we need in there and stuff like that and h and h you know how much power. Uh I don't have any figures right now. We uh we have to wait until we get to a more specific design phase for that. Um but and I think a significant part of the cost could be the actual the actual casing itself and and you know the the b the buttons and things like that  I think. Yeah. Basically yeah. So yeah. That's all I have really. Click  don't Yeah. Mm-hmm. Right as far as i it's just uh the cost of an extra button. I mean software-wise there's really no difference. I think. Scheduling. Um to find out what what you're watching even if there's commercials you know. I think I ha I agree. Well for me Yeah. Unless you have a Yeah. Mm-hmm. I think a lot of that's proprietary anyways. You're not gonna be able to  you  like command a TiVo with our remote. I don't think. I think if it's possible you should try to you know have a talk with management about that. Just you know Right it's just not Yeah. Well Right. I'm just thinking you know with all these universal remotes that are out there  how many people how many people actually use every feature that ar you know i like these trainable remotes and things like that  where  you know  it's just so confusing to do to use all these functions. Where I think the largest portion of the market is just gonna you know they lost their T_V_ remote  they need another one that'll work with their T_V_. They want something that looks nice  that that that isn't gonna break when they drop it  that you know that maybe it's it's ergonomic  it feels good in your hand  something like that. I think that's gonna be where you're gonna find the biggest  you know  market share. I think the more bells and whistles we add  it's just gonna cut into our into our profits. Because I think as we as we add costs for things like uh for like if we add the voice recognition and things like that  I think you know what percentage of the of the um of the market is actually gonna use that? Maybe five percent  you know  and how much Right. Yeah okay. I'm sorry. Sorry boss. Yeah. Well it's kinda both of us. Us us user interface. Mm-hmm. I was thinking about that. Then your lights would go off  though. Yeah. Right. I don't I think all these things are pretty standard. I think we'll be okay. Mm you can just click. No no no you just get off that. You just click anywhere. I have an idea. And it's kind of along the s lines of environmentally sensitive  and it may even fit into ergonomics  and even kind of address the issue of losing losing the remote  what we were saying it's a common issue. Um what we can do is  well you know that batteries throwing a aw remotes run through batteries like crazy. Right? And s for some people Yeah. Well maybe not a solar remote but instead what about if we had like a power cradle? Like a a cradle that is is there to hold the remote when you're not using it  so you'll always know where the remote is 'cause you have to put it back there to charge the remote  and we can  instead of having instead of having  you know  replaceable batteries we'll just have a power cell that stays there for the life of the remote. You never have to get go through the go through uh all these different batteries. And also you can I I think it's a good opportunity for the user design or for not just for the user design  but also for the just for the look and feel of the remote as as a whole. You know you could have some kind of neat little  you know  a sexy design for d a cradle and the remote itself. It w it would increase the cost. And you could page the remote if you lose it. Maybe there's a button on the cradle. Well what I can do is I can d look into ho well Pedro and I can look into how much this might increase our our costs and you can look into what kind of effect an increased cost is gonna have on our on our final numbers. I I Yeah. I just don't know about that  because in order to do that in order to price it at that kind of level I think we'd need to have every functionality that all the other competitors are offering like being able to operate  you know  the D_V_D_ player and  you know  the stereo system and all that. Which is a pretty basic function that w we've opted out of. And additionally we're m maybe not supporting teletext um But I do think there are some basic features that we don't have that a lot of other remotes are going to have. Mm-hmm. I don I I d I have to disagree though. I think our market niche is basically people who need who have lost their remote or uh who've broken their remote and don't wanna send back to the manufacturer  they just wanna run out to the store and get a remote  and then they're gonna look on the shelf and they're gonna see ours is the nicest looking remote. It does what they need. These aren't I I think that it Right. Right. Mm-hmm. Right. Well here's Right. We he well here's my thing about that. If you're in the market for this ultimate remote  you're not gonna go for just a television remote. If it can't control if it can't control your your D_V_D_ player and a al if y if you can't get that all-in-one ultimate remote  that just you can throw all your other remotes away. I'm not gonna buy a d seventy-five Euro remote. So I think what we So that's what I'm saying Mm-hmm. I think that's big. I think so  yeah. Yeah. What about um the idea that I had with the cradle? How do you feel about that? Or how does everybody feel? No  but I that's the thing I I don't think it's necessarily the other end. Mm-hmm. Right. Well it lasts it would last for several hours on its own power  but when you're done with it you put it back in the cradle. Yeah well it Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Well the the problem with that is we may end up with a whole bunch of inventory of a of a poor design you know. So Um but what we could do is some kind of well I mean Yeah we we need to  I mean  have a few designs to look at and then come up with something that I think we all agree is  you know  the best fit. I think w what's really important is it has to look good  it has to feel it has to feel good in your hand  it has to be durable  it has to a and I think it's really important that it doesn't look cheap. I think I think we have to make sure people look at it an and feel like it its like a quality remote. Even though the cost may be low. Mm-hmm. Or what if it looks like a pen? Yeah. A pointer? Yeah. Yeah. So just to touch on m my point one last time that I had brought up. Um I really un unless you guys are die-hard against the fact that um it's possible like it reduces the usability of the remote b and the fact that you can't lose it on your own  I think it still might be a good idea to investigate having like a power cradle. Because I really think i in a certain sense it almost like for me I would want to have that just  because I know at the end of when I'm done watching T_V_ that when I'm done  oh I better go find the remote and put it back where it belongs. Maybe th th th that's just some people that like that. A lot of people As a watch? Mm 'kay. Mm-hmm. That's what I was saying. Exactly. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And also presumably they've Exactly. Yeah. True. Right. Yeah. The locator'll definitely be more expensive. Mm-hmm. Right. Right. I think one of the things that we can put right on the box is  never buy another battery. You know  something like that. ,The project manager recapped the events and decisions of the previous meeting. The marketing expert presented research on user preferences and tendencies with remote controls. The research indicated that users want remotes to be more attractive  to match the behavior of the user  to be easier to locate when misplaced  and not to cause RSI. The research also indicated that younger users were interested speech recognition. The user interface designer spoke on the option to have a universal remote  presented two differently designed remotes available on the market  and described some features a user-centered remote should include. The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and then the team discussed the option to include speech recognition in their design. The project manager briefed the team on some new requirements to abide by. The team then discussed the option to include a recharger with a locater button in their design  the appearance of their remote  buttons  how to make an ergonomic remote  and the option to have a two-piece remote. 
Mm-hmm. Mm. A nice one. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe. Oh yeah  that's a good that's a good point  so. One and Yep. Yeah but Yeah but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control because the That's right. It's it's And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to manual controllers  eh. No  more expensive maybe. Well y y you have also the language problem  you know when you 'Cause it it have to be universal  so. Yeah. Yeah but you know. The product The pro It's a very smart  it's a very smart controller maybe Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah. But Yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller  you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world  the same one. If you have the language  you have to develop for each country. Yeah  but for each country you have to do one  because uh the for example for Se Oh really? That's Comple A microphone maybe. To talk to the to the T_V_ maybe. I if you say one  he switch to channel  yeah. So well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the T_V_ to switch to channel one. Devic Yeah. Yeah. Yeah but so you need a camera and you know a microphone inside your remote control. Yeah. But I think that  you know  switching from one country to to another will be a problem  so although y y Yeah but i i Yeah  we should. Uh. Mm. Yeah  but I think he need a control that is very reliable  so. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's not really the we we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet  so or something like that. But uh I think a user need Don't have a the the Yeah if we can send email from it. Because the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if Yeah And for all the person of the family maybe  so  yeah. Because you have new Ye Okay. Okay. Yeah  participant two um Yeah  working design  so. So I think Can you go to the next one? I uh it's not this one. It's uh oth the oth so I It's the working design. Sorry. Component design. So this yeah so this is the described use What? Are you inst I don't think so. Oh. Maybe I record recorded directly on the Computer. Okay  okay. Yes. I can say it to you without. Yeah  exac Okay. Yeah. Yeah. In fact  I don't know  I s because i in my presentation I don't have here with so It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r of the remote control. So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside and so. So I in fact the the f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use  so will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one. So and in which which which kind will be the the different bu button  so it can be some  you know  classic pushbutton like this one  or you have also some button like L_C_D_ where you know  the button the buttons are unlighted during the night  or  you know  you can see them in the darkness. And the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation  electric alimentation do you want to have  so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation or will it be a battery like the classical battery so. And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have uh both of them  so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from  you know  the cities uh for example in some place in in S Senegal  so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation  you just  when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it  for example. Yeah. Yeah  yeah mm. Ecologists  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah. Alrigh In fact  having them both will if we want to have battery  regular battery and and the solar energy battery it could be it'll it will add a little bit of the price  but it will be an added value also that will be compensated  so hmm. And the materials  it depends for example you if you have a wooden material it can be more the plastic material is more common it's very resistant but  you know  something wooden will be like  I don't know high cl so a special high class  or you know  you can have some Yeah  even if it is not completely wood  but just a part of the  you know  will be wooden  in wood and it can be interesting. And so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits  chips  or do you have low level or or very very expensive  it depends  but I think that low level will be  you know  it is an interim module. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  yeah. Yeah  I think it will fit on the price we want  twel twelve Euros  so. I think the buttons I pr I prefer  you know  the L_C_D_ you know lighted buttons because  you know  it's I don't know um yeah  in the dark  it's fashion and it's related to how beautiful it is or uh if you want to watch T_V_ in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost  you know in the darkness it's very easy so  right. I think a touch screen will be t as expensive as the L_C_D_ buttons so. But And it is a kind of other design  I mean. It can also be interesting to have this kind of Mm. Ah yes. Yeah  yeah. Okay  yeah. Okay. And fruit and vegetables yeah. Spongy 'Kay. Okay  yeah  yeah. Yeah  but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy? Pla S Very stuff Okay  rubber rubber desi okay  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Solar. Okay. Yeah. It will be a Yeah. Yeah  I think Yeah  yeah. Yeah. No wood but Plastic? Would some I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and  you know. It depends on the design we want  so. Yeah  it's natural and i And it can be correlated to energy  solar energy  so for the marketing aspect  you know  saying that it's ecol Mm  yeah  it's not right  so. Okay. Google and and fancy  f how about the the voice? And Uh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested and how It It is an an interesting concept to see to have uh voice control. Mm. Yeah. But and the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_  so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually  so. But it will be embedded on the T_V_ and not on the remote control  so. Yeah  L_C_D_. Yeah  yeah  yeah. And pf what can we think a supplement to I think the supplement can be the voice. It is just  you know  it is not the most important  but it can be a part of Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Mm. To push button  yeah  yeah. Even it is for s just some kids  you know  switching channels one two three four. Yeah  turning yeah  yeah. Not very complex commands  but easy commands  so. Yeah. Yeah  simple ones for expensive buttons Yeah  to make some new Yeah. Okay  fruits. Okay. Need it to be  okay. Okay. Okay. Sounds good  mm-hmm. Yep. Yeah. No no no. Yeah. Mm. So uh first I will present the concept of user interface. Um there's three concepts in the user interface. So first one it's a Google controller. The second is a fancy controller. The last one is uh intelligent controller. So there are three concepts in our controller. Um n next I will explain one by one  the first is Google controller. Um  so I want the controller to be easy to use  but with sophisticated functions. So it's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions. Uh this is a first concept of our controller. The second concept is a fancy controller  um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive  um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products  so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute  very very g um attractive. Such like this  there are several uh examples in the slides. Yeah  it's very  you know if you're Yeah. It's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it. Or to recognise it  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So the last uh concept is intelligent. We want uh we want our controller to be smart  so maybe we should uh use um uh technology  such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology  so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition. Um With this advanced features we I think we can attract a lot of user. Okay. No. There this is the three concepts of our controller. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  so Y Uh I think some time it's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button. For example  if you cannot find your uh controller  you can just uh just just uh speak something such as  yeah  one two. Yeah. So you can use your gesture. That's no problem. For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very Yeah. Yeah  they cannot speak at the same time. Yeah  it's very interesting. Yeah. Yeah  that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller. Even you h you have the controller  I can I can say channel three  so it's c come to channel three  I don't have to It's advantage. How much? No no we we d we we just are use um No no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute  we don't have to do some basic research on this field. Yeah  I think it's uh because uh this technology is uh um for limited wor or limited wor uh lexical recognition  it's very it's uh yeah. It's No it's uh Even for the f um because the the vocabulary the The vocabulary is very small  so that's not a problem. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  the key  the key um the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some um adaptation mechanism. It's It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese. It's r if you sell this controller in France it can recognise French. Yeah  it's Because of this product uh this technology has already been developed. So Yeah. Yeah. Oh n Yeah  yeah tha that's why we have to do language adaptation. Yeah. Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to No  it's not so complex. No no no it's not I think that's n that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone. It it just the microphone is embedded in the controller. Where is the controller? It's in your family  in your home. Yeah. Yeah you can you can embed it uh microphone here. Yeah yeah just you just put the controller here  then you you use your command and you do s your gesture. No no it's n y if you lose it Yeah. Yeah. I think it we should give the uh flexibility to the user and we think yeah. You can see they can switch form one modality to another. No  that's quite inter quite attractive. Well  if you do language adaptation  there should be no problem. We should have confidence in technology. More features  yeah. Yeah but if if you stick to um stick to the first two parts. So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market? There's no k features of our controller  so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features? Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that Yeah  you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller  that's a function of T_V_. You can replace your T_V_ with a new T_V_ with internet browsing function  but Okay. But it's not the only the problem only the issue of controller  it's it's also the issue of the T_V_. Yeah  but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller  but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it  your mobile  but you when you choose a new mobile  you choose the one with voice recognition. That's the feature is not one hundred percent reliable  but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our from other products. Yeah. Yeah  uh Yeah  if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable  would you replace it with another one? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh yes  but there's no big difference between the traditional controller. The then nn no. Tha But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller. That's the same yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. It did didn't r receive it. Didn't receive it. Participant one. Participant one. Yeah  maybe we can first come to uh to Frahan. With Frahan  then you can prepare your slides  then present it later. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Okay. Uh-huh. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. So you got email? Mm. Later? Pla Uh yes. Yeah. Yeah. The smart controller. Okay. Mm. Yeah. It's good. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yep Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. No y you do the minutes first  or? No? Okay. Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm. Yeah but how how is how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition? Okay. Okay. But this this but this would never happen anyway. Yeah Yeah  but the Yeah but this Yeah. I don't think it Oh  okay  okay  you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff. No. No  but this is disadvant disadvantage. Yeah. Uh if you if if you use the basic But it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built. Because then you need uh I mean this doesn't have uh the power to do recognition  for example. Yeah. Yeah  this could be downloaded by the web maybe  or Yeah. Mm. Yeah  but then w Yeah  we have to take care of the twelve Euros problem. Okay. No  but then it's it's like this uh Yeah. But you would still have the buttons. Or is it do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition? Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons? Okay  so you yeah. Yeah  I dunno. It's a bit risky risky. Yeah  I dunno. What? If if I mean  uh I'm sure if the user pays the same price  he's happy to have recognition. But if if if it like doubles uh no one would would be interested. Yeah. No  I mean Y No  but you need you need new remote controller then. Because if you wanna browse internet or  I don't know  if you wanna type something  or No. No. Cause for example yeah. Yeah. Yeah  you wou you would True. I mean  for example the goo y you say we would we would to have a Google-like controller. I don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google. Google is is simple  works fine  so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic  simple and works fine  it's already a lot. Uh thi this I mean  the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition or if he has something that works fine and is really fancy  looks nice and it's easy easy to use  easy to use. See That's the problem  yeah. I mean  I I know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever. But you have to think  the user is the one who gonna buy the product and so. I mean  that's the point. Hmm. Yeah. Dunno. I dunno if you remember what you had to say or I think it's more interesting what he says  okay. Yeah  true. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Special for Mm-hmm. Yeah. What about the touch scr touch screen? For example. It's it's expensive I I guess. Mm. Yeah. Okay. Uh no  trend watching. The other one. Yeah. Uh  I think so  just Yeah  so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market  so next. So again  it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting. Um user really really want a fancy look and feel. They're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel  okay. Like the one you've shown  David  with all the buttons and I mean i i it sounds good technically but it's it's not what they want and uh So  second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative  so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on. At the same time  it's important that it's easy to use. So that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis. Now i if we look at fashion in general um Okay. Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables  okay  so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing. 'Cause it's it's really what people want. Even if it's in general fashion  we want it to be in the remote control. And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points  fancy look and feel has  on a score of seven would have six as importance. Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative  it's three. Then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones. So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one  and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from Milan and Paris we go to the fruits and vede vegetables. And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch  okay so this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design. I dunno. Yeah thi this is this would be like um plastic-like  but rubber  mayb maybe  you know  rubber-like uh device  so um Okay  tha tha that was the main point  I think  from the trend in fashion. Yeah  so when I think it's Mm-hmm. Maybe not no wood  but I mean ma maybe not the part you touching you know. Yeah  maybe the base. But still y Yeah. Yeah  I mean it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view. But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons  or I dunno. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah d I dunno. What interface? Yeah  no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends. If possible. Hmm. Okay. So let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design. So  as the previous meeting I will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision. So I will first uh What? I I think I will let uh our User Interface Designer speak first  Mister David Jordan. So  we'll S technical accessoire? Interface? This. I'm not sure the one in the middle is very attractive. It's very big  yeah. Okay. Yeah  why not. We'll have big discussion I suppose after that  so. Okay. Something else? I just have one question  because for the intelligent controller  you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition  but as the um expert told us  most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels. Do you think they will be able to use gestures? Because  if they do all the time the same gesture  as you said previously in the last meeting  maybe they will get injuries because of that? or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five  I think they will be bored after a while. You don't think so? Yeah  sure. I That's true. Yeah  but suppose you got a cold. You have a mute remote controller. Broken arm? Yeah  but suppose you have a family watching T_V_  and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time  do you think it will work? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time? Why? If you have one brother and one sister and they want to watch their favourite uh T_V_ programme  so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time  so. Yeah  but you have the remote control  so maybe you can keep it f with you. You're not you're not obliged to share it. Yeah  we can yeah. Yeah  I think it's a disadvantage. Yeah  but one other question. How how much will it cost? Yeah. Because I suppose we need to do research to have something working. Some some efficient. So you think it won't cost an Not a lot for us? Or? Yeah  but uh uh Mm-mm. Yeah. I agree with uh Yeah  but there is one problem that uh Baba talked about is the international remote control. We need something that is international. Suppose we're we want to sell it in France. The recognition system will be able to understand French. If you want to go to England  it will be able to understand English  so. Mm  okay. And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control? Yeah  but how will you Oh. Seems to be quite complex. And what about voice recognition  do we have microphones? And where will be they? Do you think if we're far from television it will work? Yeah  but where is the controller? Yeah. Yeah  but we're here it's uh an object. But here you say you want to use i uh s technology. Yeah  but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this  if you have an object. If you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free  without any object. You just want to interact with television. Yeah  but you can lose it. Okay you so you can build a kind of black box and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice. Ah. Yeah  but Mm. I think so. And maybe it will be quite Okay. Hmm. So  what do you think? We'll try the controllers you'd prefer. Which kind of controller would you prefer to use  you as a remote control user? So I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller. Maybe try to mix the Google controller and the fancy controller? Hmm? Just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller  easy to use  sophisticated and fancy. You think it's possible? Yeah  but uh we want so Yeah  but w we we want something th that works all the time  every day  every hour  for everyone. You don't need to tune it. Yeah  why not? If it's Not too expensive too. Okay. So let's go to the Industrial Designer. Maybe we'll be able to take a decision after that  so. Two? Working? I can Okay. It's okay Uh I think there's something wrong with your Maybe you you record it somewhere else. Interface concept. No. Mm mm. Uh. Nope. It seems that we have a problem with the Yeah  so No  I think it will be more interesting to start with uh Yeah. You will had s some more information in I think it will be interesting after your presentation to have um Baba's presentation. So. Okay. Okay  never mind. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Yeah  I think it's an added value to the remote control and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers and but about the the price of adding this solar battery  would it be something really that will increase the price of production more  no? So. Okay. And what tha what about the uh materials? Impersonal  mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah  and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm okay  seems to be interesting  mm. Yeah  we want something easy to use and so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough. And you think that we will be Okay. So wood. And what about the buttons? No it's fashion  yeah. I dunno. I think we have only uh five minutes left. Participant four? Functional requirements? This one? Okay. So we have to take decisions about the component concepts  about the energy. So  as you say you want something technologically innovative  maybe using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting  maybe will attract pro-ecology consumers. Uh cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be uh enough to have something working well. Case. So you think case. Something spongy. Someth no wood. Maybe you It's it's natural. Th The feeling is natural  so maybe we can stay with wood. But it's still fashion. Yeah  something that you can into it. Uh and what about the user interface concept? Google and fancy? Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this. Yeah  but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice. That's true. So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller  maybe try to mix them these two concepts together  just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood. And L_C_D_ buttons. Yeah  I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add. Yeah  for the interface something added value. With a module? You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use commands  words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers. Turning the T_V_ o on o or off. So  adding some vocal commands. Simple ones? Okay. So the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes so we'll you will all have to work in in your direction. So you will have to work on the look and feel design  to have the easy to use  powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition. Uh you will have to work more  Baba  on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control. And I sup I think we'll have to evaluate th the product too. Yeah. Yeah. And remember as as I said last meeting  we really have to build a fashion remote control and uh the colour of the um the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control. So you will have Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us um modelling a cl a clay remote control  so you will have to model model something. And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach. So  no more questions  we can close the session. Yeah. Okay  cool. ,The project manager presented the agenda and the minutes from the previous meeting. The group discussed speech recognition   whether the remote should slide open or fold open  and what type of chip they should use. The designers presented the prototype  which resembles an ipod in appearance  and is made of transparent coloured plastic. The colours will be changeable. The remote has both buttons and a scroll wheel. The number buttons have a back-light. The group discussed adding extra buttons/functions. The prototype was evaluated and received an average overall score of 1.8. The project manager went through the finances  and the total cost came to 12.3 euros  although this did not include the cost of the recharger  which was not on the price list. The group evaluated the project process  and were generally pleased with their creativity and teamwork  but were unsatisfied with the equipment. 
No. We should make a big sponge lemon  and then it'd be it would be yellow. It's Yeah. Mm. No  it's got it's got it. Wow. Uh it looks threatening. It looks like yeah. Wow. Then d blind don't watch T_V_. They do? The L_C_D_ and the other stuff uh  I think. Ben bana Hmm. But uh price price not withstanding um  is it too complicated  is it gonna be too much just overload? But but the thing is when you use a remote control  you never look at it  right? You're looking at the T_V_ and and it's uh It just seems kind of like a a needless th So which vegetable? Okay. The the lemon. Well what are the options? Oh. Okay. Um so I guess there are a lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among  and I'll I'll give you the uh  I guess  technical considerations for those. And I'm gonna use the whiteboard  just 'cause we haven't used it. Right. So  the way I'm gonna do this is uh we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls  see how they work  uh reuse the the vital kind of um essential pieces of it  and then we'll throw in our new innovations um and keep it all within budget. So uh yeah  looking inside a a very simple remote control. Um this is what they sent me. 'Kay. Here's uh the competition  I suppose. Um you open it up  there's a circuit board inside  um and there's a a chip  a processor  the T_A_ one one eight three five  which um receives input from the buttons  and ch Right  it's very they're very cheap remote. This remote costs nothing  you know. Um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier  which is made of some transistors and amplifiers  op-amps  and then that gets sent to the uh to the L_E_D_ light  which I can kinda see is that little red light bulb at the end  and that sends out the infrared uh light signal to the television. Oh here it is. Um so this is kind of the the bear essentials that we need to have in our remote control  because it it defines the uh R Um no  I mean this is a very old one  so now with the new technology this is a a minimally small and cheap thing to make. Right. So this is what we need to have for certain. Um. So you know  as we said  we got the outer casing  which we have to decide  you know  what's it gonna be  um the board we have to use basically uh the same set-up  processor  um we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had  amplifier and transmitter are all standard. Um so for the casing  uh this an e-mail I got from our manufacturing team uh  you know  we have a bunch of options from wood  titanium  rubber  plastic  whatnot  um latex  double-curved  curved. So lots of choices  what do we think? Uh or sponge  I guess  isn't on there  right. Organic sponge. Uh yeah  it's very elasticy for sure. Um. Yeah so Okay so  here are a a plastic  uh latex Oh right. So something with give to it. Okay. And and the colour is yellow  right? Yellow  okay. Um. Mm' kay. So yellow for the body  and then what colour for the buttons? So multi-coloured buttons. Okay. Okay. Mm 'kay so the shape we wanna go Um how exactly? Maybe double What about a banana? Yeah? Okay  like we could have a big banana shaped remote control  'cause it's yellow fruit  right? Oh i it doesn't matter which end you point  I guess. We could have a little L_E_D_s on each end. So a spongy banana re Yeah. Okay  okay. See So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable like so it would have a stem perhaps and a maybe a it'd be s axially symmetric. So it'd look like this kinda. Like a gourd almost  or a squash of some sort? Yeah  and it has a a clear top and bottom so y so you could say  you know  it transmits from this end. Yeah. Okay  so double-curved  single-curved  what do we feel? Okay. Okay um  I guess  since you're the marketing guy. We'll uh Okay  we could do that. Um. Okay  so so buttons. Okay  just like that. Okay. With the scroll-wheel or no? Okay uh I could put the microphone here. Okay there's the microphone. Where should I put the microphone? Okay  well we can do some user test with scroll-wheels  right? Okay. Okay. So should the microphone be just anywhere on it or 'Kay there's the mic. Um n well we can Whoops. Um. Yeah. Um. Oops  sorry. Okay. Right. Hmm. They can work from a You don't have to hold it. Yeah. I it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers  you know they have uh fruits all round them. Now just make sure they don't eat the remote. Yeah. Okay. But yeah But yeah  about the speech thing  it doesn't have to be hand held or close. It can sit at a distance and pick it up still. Yeah yeah. Okay  um so Yeah  s I guess we decided on material  right? So that that spongy latex rubber everything feel  and the colours we got down  and the shape  maybe we'll just make it kinda mix and match type of shape or Yeah. Okay. Mm. Mm-hmm. Great. Um as for the energy source um  you know  almost every remote control uses just batteries  but we don't have to be limited by that. We can use a hand-dynamo. Um I don't know what that means  we crank it? Right  it's like those watches that you c So  this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab  you can shake it if it's out of power. Okay. So if it if it's not working  I guess people's natural reaction anyway is to just shake the thing. Right. Okay. Uh there's solar power. Um. Yeah. Okay  so probably just Mm. 'Kay. Okay. So uh a rechargeable battery. Okay. Um the user interface  the buttons  I guess we talked about this already. Um. Hmm? Uh th the uh the electronics um  basically the more features we add um Oops  this one. So the more features we add the fancier chips we need to buy and put in  which adds to the cost as you can expect. Um. But uh I think we can keep it all under budget. So uh yes  so the speech thing you said our our techno our research and development department came up with some break-through. So just in time. Right  right. Yeah  and keeping the L_C_D_ screen out. Huh? Oh yeah that was that was it. So control F_ eight  right? Try uh flipping the screen down. 'Kay. Oh  I get to do it  too. Oh neat. Yeah  yeah. Okay. Save everything to the shared documents  is that right? Oh. Uh these lapel mics are trouble. Are we done with our meeting? Yeah. Um we are So the meeting will have about the same format as the last time. So switching over I've just left uh my first two screens. Um I have mailed you the minutes of the last meeting uh just to save time. Um and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that are particularly bothering you? N No? Okay  cool. Then we shall start with a presentation from Raj. Alright  okay. Fashion. Mm 'kay. Fruit and veg  well there you go. Just what I think of when I think of a remote control. Mm-mm-mm-mm. Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm. Function F_ eight. Hmm. Excuse me. Uh  yeah. Mm 'kay. either. Uh okay. Right  okay. Yeah. Excellent. Uh no just escape should uh 'Kay. Looks pretty complicated. Right  okay. Mm-hmm  like the middle button. Okay. Ah it's kinda like scrolling uh right  well  if I s if I'm thinking of the right one  I've got the same thing in front of my monitor  you scroll it and the when you reach the sort of um menu item that you require  you press the middle of the scroll. Right  okay. Yeah  presumably. Yeah  looks like uh looks like something out of a jet. Okay. Yeah  I m I mean the one thing I think about about these ones is um these kl uh secured areas um  I've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing. So like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever. Yeah. I mean is that not sort of to assist the blind or something  is it? Strange. No they do  they do. They listen to it. Yeah. Right  okay. 'Kay but people tend to recognise certain shapes to do certain things anyway  don't they? Brilliant. That's handy. Okay. Okay. It's still it's still got to get within our twelve fifty  you know. Okay. Yeah. I can't see tha Although  th I mean to be to be sure they have got I mean they are going crazy with the L_C_D_ technology now  so that you've got your L_C_D_ T_V_s and everything so maybe the small But I mean like I I the black and white  I guess  it just doesn't look funky enough. Um but  I mean  like even mobile phones or whatever have now have colour L_C_D_ screens  w I ju I mean I wouldn't know about the costs of them. Twelve fifty. Possibly. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Well I mean we could make a Yeah. Well  si since we're going for the uh the k the sort of company colours  I think your lemon wasn't that far s And if it doesn't work you know  we've just made a lemon. Mm-hmm. I like I like the colourful buttons as well. Yeah. I mean we are marketing to sort of twenty five to thirty five  so most people will have come in contact with that kind of use. Yeah. And that means tha that means you get to bump that bit to the T_V_ maker  so 'Kay. Yeah  looks like it. Uh Yeah  I was just thinking the self same thing. Magic man. Mm-hmm. So this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip  is it? Right. Okay. So can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum or? They gotta be Almost a key-ring. Okay. 'Kay. Well. Well  I mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it  doesn't it. Um Yeah. And that would k also give it kinda durability and and ther that's also f sorta relatively cheap to cast. Um so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath? Oh right  okay. I don't know what that stuff is. Yeah. Or at least incorporating  yeah. I mean I forgot i we're sort of uh I don't know what other standard silver kind of Other parts or uh Mm-hmm. Um. Um I quite like the multi-coloured buttons myself. Yeah or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish  perhaps. Yeah. Although I mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well. I mean if we are gonna make it a novel I mean double-curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use  a bit comfier  you know. Yeah it's uh  yeah  that that'd be that's sort of comfortable to hold  easy to hold so you don't drop it. Well  yeah  I mean like Yeah  yeah. Mm and a lemon might be a little hard to grip. Yeah. They only cost pennies. Huh? Um. I mean that that th does it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe. S And sponginess. Huh. Uh. Yeah  why the hell not. Let's that'll make us fifty million Euros. Um. Well  I guess it's kind of dra uh you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape  yeah? Yeah  we can relate it by advertising or Yeah. There's a good man. There's a good idea. Um I l I su I mean for the specific functions  you know  up and down  uh play  stop. They've got  I mean  they've got standard sort of intuitive um things that are always used. That's cool. I like it. Um. Uh speech recognition  I think  so we need a microphone presumably. Yeah. I mean ho h h wel are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use? Glad  we're not doing this for real. Yeah. And uh I think if this this new software for the sound recognition is the microphone I would put it sort of sub-centrally  so it's Yeah. So it can be sort of held and w We really need really gonna need to hold it  if it's gonna be voice recognition. Oops. Um. Upsidaisy. I s I still like it. Um but that's me. Yes  or maybe it's just going a bit uh too far. I mean we are pushing it probably with funny fruit shapes. Um don't wanna sort of overkill. 'Cause I mean like uh if we I mean how good is the speech recognition thing? Do we want to go for buttons at all  do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit? Yeah  you know  and then you just tal I mean like everybody's got fruit bowl in front of the telly. Um. Yeah. Make them make them think of fruit  yeah. I mean uh some uh I l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh  I dunno  an apple. Then it's just apple so sort of Uh  yellow apples though Hmm. Yeah. Okay  yeah  that's good. Groovy. Yeah . Yeah. So I mean like you could actually Yeah  gives you the options. So a selection of casings. It kind of fi it fits with f fits with marketing um Like like mobiles  yeah. You can standardise those  I mean. I think tho I think if you're gonna have a facia then you'd want to have it so that it does go over the buttons  'cause when if you think about it if they're wanting it  'cause they want to look at it  if they're using it  and what they want to look at is facing away from them. It doesn't really You know 'cause that'd be in the palm of their hand and they wouldn't be able to see it  unless you have sort of you got the buttons options on one side  and you get the facia on the other side with a microphone so that you can place it face down. And you've got the facia  and you can just talk at the Maybe. So you've narrowed it down to half a dozen options. Yeah. Yeah. Okay  so we stick with what we've got there. Mm 'kay. Mm-hmm. Well  it's kind of gotta be our company's yellow. So again I mean like we could have  uh I mean  we could quite easily have the the main body be a different colour  but have kinda going round  yeah. Um I mean e even if I mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company colour  so you know um blue and yellow tend to go to we well together. So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing. W sort of Uh It's I think it's basically the more you move i it  it's got a wee thing inside that just kinda powers it. Uh yeah. Yeah  I like that  yeah. Yeah. Okay. You shake it and scream at it. Yeah. It does leave them with an obligation to Especially if they want to use it uh uh sp uh specifically as um voice activated. Then if it's just sitting on the Okay  okay. Right um what are the other options? Yeah. I'm I'm with uh Raj on that  I think  you know  I've got I've got no I've got a north facing house  there's not really ever sun coming in my window. Oh that's true. I mean I w I w uh that idea that I thought um just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that kind of bother is having a  yeah  having a rechargeable stand  so that not only it doubles as a stand  but um for using it as uh recharging it  but also for using it as sound recognition. Yeah that kind of thing. Yeah. Rechargeable.. What's chip on print? What's Sorry  never mind. Yeah  and if we if we're just having buttons and the speech then we're getting our cheapest option of chipping. That's good. Uh woah. Okay  we're we're kind of uh we're kind of um Excuse m I've just deleted that whole thing. Um we're kind of running out of time  so if you could Uh. Was that you? Um that was your bit's covered  I just dele I just accidentally deleted what I was supposed to say next. Um  yeah. Oh  yeah. And I just touch the pad. It's actually shut down. Okay  um now what we have uh our next meeting's in half an hour and what I would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay. Yeah. It's you guys. Yeah. So um  you know I mean  luckily we chose a nice simple shape. Um and further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches. Uh yeah  I hope I can recover this  'cause I've accidentally deleted it. Which doesn't really help me much. Yeah  can you save that uh send that last one again  please  Raj  as I still can't find it on the Okay. No. Okay  thank you. Um yeah  Project  Project Documents. Uh right  that's that's the that it goes there automatically if you put it in Project Documents. Project Documents is on the um desktop. Really? Oh right  I think um Hold on. Yeah  I don't know if y it it just ca it just came up on my um on my agenda. S Um presumably there's clay somewhere. Um. Four. Whoops. Light  light  please. Light. Right  there you go. Yeah  quite. And we're using this our basic chip set  so it's all good. Um I think we're almost done  yeah. Oh oops. Sorry man. Uh okay  still didn't manage to get down all the last bits so we had rechargeable and Uh. Apples. Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm. 'Kay  so we came up with that  that's okay. What's supplements? Supplements. Uh uh. See. I shoulda something like that. If I kn see I I knew that. I shoulda sort of engineered it so we k ended up making a diffi difficult shape. Just for cruelty. I wonder if they mean like literally make it  sort of buttons and everything. Um. Uh no  I think that's us our discussion over unless anybody's got questions or confusions  'cause I'm confused. Huh? Um uh we'll probably get questionnaire in a minute  it's a There we go. Warning  finish meeting now. I rounded it up far too fast. Um. Where are we going? My Documents  that's not what I want. My Project Documents. There we go. Mm-hmm. Okay. Cool. Mm um. No  I don't think so. The last one is the most important one  is it? Oh  sorry. Okay. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Sorry. I was just reading fruit and vegetables. Hard to know how we are going to incorporate that. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Th that's very good. Glow-in-the-dark. Okay. Well  that's good. That's what we kind of predicted anyway. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay  the spongy  not real spongy  you can Do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff? Okay. Quite disposable. Okay. Oh okay. Uh-huh. Okay. Cool. Mm. A remote control? Yeah. And were there any factors that weren't important in the survey  that they said we don't want? Or was it just Okay. Cool. F_  what is it? Um. yeah. Okay. No signal. Is that? Okay  and then F_ five  right? Okay. Um okay  so the interface concept um. Yeah. The interface specification  what people um how they interact with it basically  I think. Um so the method  we looked at existing designs  what are the what's good about them  what's bad about them  um I looked at their flaws  so we're going to look at their flaws  everything. Um and what the survey told us and what we think would be good  so a bit of imagination. Uh the findings  I've got some pictures to show you as well. Yeah. Okay  so most remote controls use graphical interface  where you um have got s buttons and you point it rather than having the output as a a stream of text or something. Um and we also found that there's inconsistent layout  which makes it confusing. So I think for our remote control There is some inconsistency already in ec existing in between remote controls  but I think standard kind of um shape and uh play and those kind of but buttons like the the top right for on and off or something  I think  people find that important 'cause then it's easy to use. And we've got some pictures of some uh new remote controls to show you. Do I press Escape F_ five? Or just Escape  okay. Um  oh I still haven't got my glasses on. Yeah  okay. So these are the some of the pictures of existing ones. I'll just walk you through them. This one is a voice recognition. And that's the kind of idea we're going for. There's um an L_C_D_ thing  which we thought could I thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us. This one is got a kind of scroll like a mouse  which Yeah. Um and But I'm not exactly sure how you'd use that  like would the computer come Uh-huh  that's like the L_C_D_ one  is it? But the one below that has got like a little scroll function on the side. But I presume that the functions must come up on the T_V_ screen. I think that's what that is. So these are just a few ideas. Again that's just quite boring shape  grey  looks quite space-agey  but too many buttons  I think on that one. Yeah  it does look kind of dangerous. Um this one I thought was really cool. It's w it's got the programmability function that we talked about. You can put it in there  it's for your kids  and it's quite an organic shape and the little circle around there is pretty cool. And that's really easy to use  bright  so I like this one lot for our design. I think something like that would be good. Of course yellow. Right  yeah. Yeah  that's true. Yeah. Um so maybe that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the T_V_ or something. And this one  the over-sized one  I don't know about you  but I think it's a bit too gimmicky. I don't think that will sell very well. I guess so. I don't know. I think that's a bit Yeah exactly. Yeah. And um this one is just pointing out. I like some of these things um the the raised symbols and everything  but pointing out um that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down  but it would actually go up  because of the shape. So that could that's a bit confusing. Um but the buttons on this I think are it's just showing you how you can have different different um buttons. They don't have to be all the same. So that's quite cool. Um. Yeah  exactly. Um F_ five. Yes. So there are some of the findings. So we need to combine those ones um and I've just got an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in. Um yeah it is  just in time  very handy. Um so I think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good. It's you program it like you say  record  um and then  play  and then  record  play machine  and stuff like that  so that's And it's much Yeah. So that's quite cool. Uh personal preferences just some imagination  the raised symbols I thought were good  the L_C_D_  it does look smart  but I think maybe for our budget  do you think that would be a bit too expensive to have the Yeah. And the speech recognition  'cause I think we're definitely going for the speech recognition  are we? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. But our budget  we've Yeah. Uh-huh. Okay. I'm not sure if the if for twenty five Euros uh per uh twelve Euros fifty m manufacturing cost . The L_C_D_. Yeah. No. Yeah. S Uh-huh. Yeah  that's the thing  because Yeah. That's true  yeah. And one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use  so I think I'm not sure about the L_C_D_. It's a it's great  it's a good idea  but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for eas easy to use  it's not the thing we should go for  I think. Child-friendly  I thought this was good  as you pointed out the um the bit  it often goes missing especially with children  but it's a good shape and the organic is kind of we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape  I think. Yeah  I know  carrot. Yeah. But we don't want it to be Yeah. Um the child-friendly  yeah. Easy to use  it seems quite easy to use. I like the d the different shapes of the buttons and stuff. I think that's a good idea to go for. Yeah. And the mouse one  I thought it was a good idea  because people use mo mice mouses now with the scrolling thing. Um. Yeah. S yeah. So they'd be able to use that um  as I said I think i I'd presume it would come up on the screen. Um so there you go. Yeah. So that's um the user interface design. So okay  I'll take this out now then. There you go. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. I'm not sure about the sponge. Yeah. Yeah. I like the rubber  the stress balls  I think  you know  that could be a bit of a gimmick like it's good to hold and Yeah. And that might be quite durable and easy to chuck around. Yeah  y yellow incorporated  yeah. I think Mm. Yeah  the buttons w like  'cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours or i if we're having buttons actually  I don Yeah. You do have ones like um play could be green or on and off is red  and stuff like that  yeah. Makes it easy to use. Yeah  that's true  because that blue one did look quite hardish. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Like uh an hour glass kind of figure  is that what you're thinking of  or just like a It's not Yeah. We could make novelty remote controls. Yeah. But then how would you point it? How would you point it? What Yeah. y I'm I'm not sure about the banana idea. Rubber banana. Okay. Yeah. I think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape. And what else did you say about fashions? What was trendy? And spongy  yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe  yeah. Like what's what's that  I don't even know the name of it  some kind of  you know where it's like looks like a little snowman kind of thing. I don't know the name of that. Yeah  that's what I was thinking. Yeah  maybe that's what they are. 'Cause that you can hold it in like the bottom bit and Yeah. I don't know. What do you guy What do you think? No. Yeah. Uh-huh. Okay. Okay. And buttons would  did we say? Uh different shapes of buttons? Mm. Yeah. Yeah  what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition? Mm-hmm. Yeah  I'm not sure. Um I mean those ideas I saw were just for inspiration  I think. Um yeah  I can no I'm not sure. I couldn Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's cool. So let's not use the whiteboard any more. And uh so what else was there? Um the What about the glow-in-the-dark thing  the strip around it? Are we just gonna leave that? You still like it. 'Cause we've got the uh technological innovation with the speech recognition system. 'Cause um it could Yeah. Especially with yellow. Mm. I dunno. Then you put it in the fruit bowl? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah  do we need buttons? Mm. I quite like the shape. I quite like the design of that  uh 'cause that could sit on its own and it's quite got a quite steady base. Um and as we say we n we don't wanna be too ridiculous with the fruit things you know. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah  'cause you said about disposable  didn't you? You said about disposable earli people want disposable things so we could do that  like have a choice. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. We still need the buttons in the same places thought  don't we? Oh  that's the other side. Oh  okay. Oh  half a fruit. Oh  okay  okay. Okay  okay. Okay. Mm mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Well  um because Well  I I'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing  because I think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit and uh because what Yeah  w I think wh wha would we're trying to get to twenty five  thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as well they said. They wanted something that looks fancy and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a too much of a gimmick  but something ergonomically shaped and organic  like good to hold  based on fruits and natural things like that  because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow  you know. I mean we could make it nice pale yellow. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with  you said  the logan the slogan. Because Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh. Oh  a d a dynamo? Yeah. Yeah  like with those watches that you kind of twist. Yeah that's quite cool. Yeah  it is  yeah. Yeah  then they have to pick it up and then activate it and then Yeah. That's true. But w like just normal light? And we're a very environmentally friendly company  aren't we as well? Yeah. Yeah. Like like a hand like one of those portable phones kind of thing. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Just in time. Yeah  mine seems to have turned off. I can't do anything. No. It's on  but there's nothing on the screen. Cool. Yeah. Mm. Okay. Yeah. I think  I've saved mine already. Cool. Fun. Yeah. Star fruit. No. Oh yeah  we can do buttons. No I'm good. Okay. Mm. Yeah. Hi  me Raj  again. Uh in this meeting I I'm going to discuss about the trend watching  uh how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this. So we have to look on this. First of all methodology. The met methodology to find out the trend was incl uh was done in a way We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey  but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market  because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit. So what are our findings? In our uh in our findings we have seen that when we did our remote control market survey we found that uh people l uh people do have preference for tho fancy mobi uh f remote controls which look and feel very good  rather than having a functional look and feel uh good. So this sh this clearly indicates their preference for the design their outlook of the remote controls. So we should take into uh we should consider this factor as the most important factor  because this factor is twice as important  the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as uh the third factor. So this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv uh uh in our mark uh means in take in designing our rem uh remote controls. No the first one is the uh the outlook of the mobile  the it should have a fancy outlook  the fancy design uh rather than just having a functional look and feel good  it should have a fancy look and foo feel good. The second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically uh innovative. We must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo uh remote controls are. So it uh should be technologically innovative like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition  something like that. So that indicates our technological advancement. And the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use  like it shouldn't be too much co complicated  there shouldn't be too many buttons on this mobi uh remote control  it shouldn't be too complicated uh like this way. And it should be uh and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language  something. So that they could know how to use these remote controls. When we did uh f fashions uh  recent fashion uh our recent fashion update shows that Ah yeah? Y yeah uh yeah  we have to  because uh d you can see how people have related their clothes  shoes  and everything with fruits and vegetables  because the g world is now changing it's trend towards organic  becoming more and more organic  becoming Yeah. So Yeah. So something like that we we should do. And people uh the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look  hard look. Yeah. Yeah. So so that they could play with it while handi uh while handling it. So that should also be taken into consideration. So these are my views. So No it ca y a The rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co Yeah. 'Cause we It shouldn't be have any harm to the environment also  because our company is very well for taking all these concerns into consideration  so we don't want to have any harm to the society  so So that's all. S uh we didn't find out any such point. Uh yes  there could be  but we couldn't find out any  so Yeah. Oh no . Yeah  uh yeah  uh yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. Hmm. But in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more  but they want the quality  they want f fancy look  they want some new design  something new. Uh yeah. Yeah. So even if we increase our cost little bit  within uh some limits  and we give something new technological advancement as well as new design with fancy outlook  I think we will meet the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market. And the Uh i it will be easy because there will be  on L_C_D_ s screen  there will be different frent icons  they can just click ok okay  whatever they wa Ah yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah  I appreciate this idea  because then this this will help us in our advertisement also and we can relate with fruits and vegetables  the people's choices. That what our data shows that  so this w this w Uh the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables  like people uh now Spongy. Yeah  then only we can relate it with something. Yeah. Exactly. Or we can do something  we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey  let the public choose what they want. Yeah  sure. I will be happy to do that. Yeah. Or we can we can do one thing  we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes  different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece. So whatever people want  like if somebody want it in banana shape  we will put that casing onto that mobile phone  okay  it will look l Uh yeah. In that w S s sorry? Uh like if this is a like if this is a mobile phone uh we will design casing in such a way like half of  we need not to have a full cover  we will just have a half of cover  okay? If somebody wants it i in banana shape  we will fit banana shape casing onto that  so it will give a banana shape look. If somebody wanted in apple shape we will design that  we will put we will put apple shape casing on that. It will give apple shape look. So in that way you can have any  that means whatever you want  without uh yeah. Yeah  button will be on the upper side  buttons will be the on the upper side. Yeah  buttons will be on the upper side  lower side we will just put the casing  so half of that will be look the Yeah  not not the upper side. So from lower you can  it means while you are holding of from this side you c you can have banana look or apple look  whatever. So in that way we need not to d have different different shape mobiles everything  we will just design casings fruit shape. And Yeah . But But but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo  tha these type of cells? Because then people have to  well like if the cell is out of bat Yeah  to mo Yeah. Yeah  because most of the people Yeah. Uh  solar power will w also not be a good idea  because then they have to keep m their mobiles outside in solar energy  and the days when there is no sola sunlight Yeah. Yeah. What we w yeah. I think we should a rechargeable battery will be a good idea. They can they can recharge it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  that's Yeah  exactly. Yeah. Uh excuse me  Bri You just touch the pad  yeah. No? That's great. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Uh it was under a different name. I will show you  in shared documents. Uh working components. Oh  you didn't get that. I will send new. Uh I'll put it in shared documents  again. Project documents  sorry  I put it in the shared documents. Uh yeah. Right  that's great. But I cou can't open that  because it w asks uh for some username or password. I'll show you. Ts Sorry. Uh. Yeah  that's great. Yeah  th thank you. Oh sorry. Uh excuse me  Brian. You have to keep your pen separate  because I used your pen. S Hmm. Hmm. So sh should Should we leave now  Brian? Or we are going to discuss something? Yeah. Excuse me. Sorry. Thank you. Yeah. So. ,The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting. The marketing expert discussed his findings from trend watching reports  stressing the need for a product that has a fancy look and feel  is technologically innovative  is easy to use  and incorporates some aspect of fruit and vegetables in its design. The interface specialist presented research on the appearance of current remotes  concluding that current remotes are generally unappealing in terms of look and usability. The interface specialist presented ideas on how to remedy the unappealing aspects of current remotes in the team's design and also how to incorporate the corporate color scheme into the design. The industrial designer presented options for materials  components  and batteries and discussed the restrictions involved in using certain materials. The team then discussed options for the shape and color scheme of the remote  as well as what components  batteries  and materials to use. 
Yeah. Choose a number? Yes. Well. Well everybody already has his presentation  so you can adjust it. Yeah. Oh right. There is something turning. Yeah  I've got it there too. Yeah. Shall I go uh next? 'Kay. So. Well uh  my name's  and I looked at uh technical functions design of the remote. Uh I did this by uh looking at examples of other remote controls  of how they uh they look  and information from the web that I found. Um well what I found was that uh th the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set  how you uh d what you described uh just early. And this can be all sorts of medsa messages  turn it on  turn it off  uh change the channel  adjust volume  that kind of thing. Uh play video  teletext  but also t uh play C_D_ if you use it your C_D_ player the remote control will that one. There are some uh examples of remote controls. You can see they are very different. The one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of uh buttons etcetera. And the other is uh more user friendly  little with big buttons. And uh not n all the the the the stuff you can do with it  but uh the the essential stuff is there. Um I guess you could better y you should look at a a user centred uh approach  because the customers have to use them and and if they don't think it's usable they won't uh buy it. A lot of buttons they may think from I don't need s as much as that. Uh  well perf personal preferences is is uh a simple remote  with uh the basic functions that you can need that you could use. But uh keep in mind the new functions of T_V_ what we discussed earlier  split screen and uh is that a function that you should have? Because all the T_V_s will have them. Or because of only a few and isn't really necessary. And then uh make it I would make so that you can could uh use it on more than one appliance. If you have one that uh uh does with the vi the the video  it could also work with uh with the stereo  because play is play and stop stop and that sort of thing. The shu c you could reuse the buttons so that you don't have to have a lot of buttons for uh anything. And it should be a user friendly  clear buttons  and not too much. And that is my presentation. You must still have it open. Yeah. Hmm. Mm. Oh right. No. Res I did not. Perhaps the rest? Oh. Mm. Well you said it should only uh work with one appliance? Or with one uh d che only the T_V_? And the video also  or not uh? Oh. Alright. Okay. Yeah. Then it should have uh on  off  and uh Yeah. And per perhaps uh No. Well uh uh yes yes s sh A button where you can uh change from one number to two numbers. Can you Don't know if that's got a name  but Yeah. S Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  so you should have that one on. Mute misschien also. An But  do you But if you would do an L_C_D_ screen do we have don don't you have any buttons? Or because if it only directs at the T_V_  then you only have uh I don't know what you want to do with the L_C_D_ screen. Yeah? Oh right  so you can Oh  yeah alright. So you can adjust which buttons you want on that s screen. Yeah alright  oh right. Yeah. Yeah. Would be yeah. Well we had twelve fifty  I guess  for uh production? Yeah. I dunno how expensive an L_C_D_ screen is. Any guesses? Yeah. But But he also said that we should not only focus on the younger people  but also on the older  and will they use it if it only has an L_C_D_ screen? Oh  so still a little bit people Yeah that's right. But you don't want to alienate the other uh But if they also buy it then it's alright. I guess. Yeah. Alright. An Yes. Yeah. Yeah. But perhaps later  so uh Yeah. I don't Well perhaps we should have a backup plan that we would use buttons if it's uh too expensive. Yeah. The L_C_D_? Oh that's a bit of a problem. Oh  that's a bit of a problem. Yeah  but they don't they don't like it. They think it's ugly. When it has an L_C_D_ screen. Oh  alright  I thought that you said that. Yeah. Yeah. A mute button. I think. And Yeah. But But shouldn't you put a button of for teletext on the for the people who want to use it? Remembering we have got a big remote that you have to fill. Yeah. Yeah  they are less important  but I think they should be there  or not? Like with a with a mouse  you have not  yeah. We should think of the twelve fifty we have but I don't know how much that's going to uh Yeah. You should Perhaps you should be able to to switch the control off. If you have an L_C_D_ screen that's burns all the time I dunno. You shouldn't on and off because that's ver extra  that you have t first you have to turn the remote on  and then you can uh I don't know. Nee that's that's uh yeah. But then you can't Yeah. Yeah yeah au automac matically  that it yeah. Yeah. If it's sensible. Yeah. Yeah  b when the batteries are low But you'll also forget to put it in  because you throw it on the couch and you don't remember. Yeah. That's right. Yeah. Well I think the batteries should should w should work a lot longer than a couple of days  or not? 'Cause Yeah  that's right  but Yeah. Right. But then you also have to s have somewhere where you can put a remo recharger near your couch because otherwise you have to walk a long way when you twoft want to turn on the T_V_. Yeah. I think everything has it for and I guess. Yeah. Alright. Yeah  twelve fifty  twelve fifty. So it's pretty big. Yeah. W I know let's do a speech. Yeah. Yeah. You can clap or something. Yeah. Now you shouldn't say the wrong thing  I dunno. But they want to talk into the remo remote control  or something  or? Oh  but do we want to implement that  or? Yeah. I know Mm. Well I don't know if that can be done with the cost of twelve fifty. With that uh Yeah  but how would you like to implement that  that you say volume up  and then it goes up  or? Uh. Then you also have to have different languages if we go international. Then uh it's y it's yours to do a French and Dutch and English and Yeah  that's right. Yeah. Yeah you can use icons for the a speaker and uh But if that's better than language for the for the remote. Then it's Yeah. Well  if it could be done  we Yeah. Yeah  that should be uh anything matters. Well  you sh you should to adjust the thing. Yeah. And you have to speak the so that it can understand. You could use that n as an option  if you have money left  or something. Yeah. Let's do speech. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. I With uh teletext if it wasn't ver very important  it was but You also now have colours. I don't know if we should implement that. Yeah  when you press the red button  you go to page one hundred two  and when you press the I don't know if we should implement that  because it says that teletext not really important  but yeah  the shortcut  and you can't go to sport. Yeah. 'Cause it should be there. So actually it is there but it's just not r ready there. You'll have to search for it. Yeah. Yeah  that's a I guess not. We've got anon Have got got two examples here  but I don't think there's anything we're missing. Well  we don't have the video orders Yeah  you could look here all the the Uh th th th th I don't know  technical functions. They're a bit small  you can we should stretch them  because I guess we've got them all. And for a T_V_? Can you zoom in a T_V_? Or that you can put 'em on uh on on wide and yeah. But that should also be a sub then  a sub uh menu thing. Yeah  so we should also implement se screen settings. Oh right. Yeah. Yeah  so you can program the Yeah  so the first you see the main  and the other ones you can uh go to uh Yeah. I hope we can do this. We don't have to use that top. Yeah. Yeah. And do we want them in different colours  or And and the buttons  should they have colours? Oh but we don't have any buttons. Yeah. They think it's ugly  right? Perhaps you can uh make adjustable fronts  like with the telephones. You can uh But I don't think that uh Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. A disco version. Five minutes? Oh yeah  right. So you can program the T_V_. Perhaps you should you'd throw them on on in one pile. So  options  and then you sub them. Otherwise you have all those teletext  perhaps teletext not  but Yeah  but I Yeah. Yeah. But I don't know. Or do we have any buttons? On the remote. Which one? But that's also in the L_C_D_  right? So we don't have any normal buttons that uh No  alright. Yet on and off is p is perhaps you kno No  no. Oh well  you should be able to set which T_V_ you have. If you have if you have uh Yeah. But isn't idea to use uh uh what you said  uh normal on and off button for the T_V_  that you don't have to use a Yeah but but not for the remote but for the T_V_  that you use But a not as normal button  in the L_C_D_  yeah. No you just tap I think. But Yeah a yeah. I don't know whether it's handy to have a n a normal on button  a r just uh rubber uh for for T_V_  so you can turn it on and then you can choose the channel. Otherwise you I don't know whether or not that's Yeah  yeah. To turn it on. Of or you should put it in the L_C_D_ screen. Yeah  I have  yeah. Well I I guess if you use the L_C_D_ screen  you first have to search where is the on button  then you uh you you then turn it  and then the T_V_ goes on. But if you have a normal on button on the on the remote  then you do the on  and then you search the channel which you want. Oh right. Yeah  I think so too. Otherwise y wet e k Yeah. Yeah. If we can afford it. Alright. Lunch. Should we put this back in our rooms  or uh? Yeah. Yep yep yep yep. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well  shall I go first with the users? I think well okay no problem. Ja precies  ja precies  ja precies E_I_E_. Animation. Infrared light. To this meeting. Smoking. 'Kay. Check. Kijke 'Kay  so. We're going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote  that m that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control  or just Yeah  and the users  actually. The methods I I prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more. Are the younger people going to buy the remote control or the elderly people? And then tho that section we're going to focus and adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user section. Okay. Some data. Younger people  from sixteen to thir forty five um years are more interested in fj features like L_C_D_ screens  speech recognition e etcetera. And we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age. The elderly people  from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features  and we possess less than two third  that's two fifth  of the market share in that area. Goed so. 'Kay. Findings. Fifty percent of the users lose their remote often. So we don't have to make it very small  like uh like a mobile phone or something  but some somewhat bi bigger than small  so you don't lose it that much anymore. Seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly  and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot  so the buttons sh should be that small  or shouldn't be that complex because we have to search for the buttons  which one are you going to use. Next. Important issues about the remote. I think it would be better with a personal reference  but okay. Remote control has to have to have a low power usage  because s w seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour  so the power usage is also one one time an hour  or so  with a high power usage we would use a lot of but batteries. The volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control  so those they those have to h be find very easily. And have to be somewhat like bigger etcetera. It has also be have to find easily when the label is gone. My colleague also announced it that labels should be scratched off or would be s uh senden okay. So uh if that's k uh if that's the problem  you also have to find it easily on the remote. Buttons. Like what all colleagues said  have to have to be minimalized. or should be covered  or in L_C_D_ screen. L_C_D_ screen is easy because we have the L_C_D_ screen  we have the various options. Put one option and then you have the all the buttons of that options  so the other options would be gone. And you don't see the buttons. So L_C_D_ screens should be easy  but an L_C_D_ screen  the problem with the L_ sc L_C_D_ screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the L_C_D_ screen a lot. So we have to that keep that in mind that if you're going to implement L_C_D_ screen  you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use. Yeah  touch screen  yeah. The last but not least  younger people are more critical about the features. Because they use the remote control often more often  and are more technical than the ol older people. And the older people spend more money  and easily on a remote control. So we have to keep in mind to to focus not a lot not that much on the younger pep younger people  but also somewhat on the elderly people. And on my personal preferences  I don't have any mo more time to come with that  but like I said  L_C_D_ screen is easily to use because you have you can implement a lot of buttons in one remote with not that much buttons. And it should be easy to use. Especially the volume buttons  the channel buttes buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels. And that is it. Ja  Be television. Only the television. So yeah  then you can yeah. Requirements  no? Functions. Yeah  the basics then by a volume  channel  one till two zero numbers on it  oh teletext doesn't have to be? Um other functions. Yeah I had Yeah  yeah. I think it's I think it's easy to implement a button with a s s what which especially do that  because some T_V_s  if you press the t one and then the two  it be between five secs it make twelve  and that's that's not relaxed to user. Yeah. So that it easy and fast. Yeah. Our main targets' age are? were? Forty five plus  or? Forties  okay because because younger people as Uh younger people have now  sixteen till to twenty five age  are f eighty one percent interested in L_C_D_ screen. From twenty six to thirty five have sixty six percent  and thirty six to forty five  fifty five percent  so I think to um Because on most recog remote controls um the print plate will be broken how much  two years. You have to press h very hard to go to the next channel. With the L_C_D_ screen it's easier because you only have to wipe the screen to uh for fingerprint  and then you can use it again. Yeah  okay. Yeah but a you don't know True. Yeah  it only says that this perce percentage like L_C_D_ screen. Because  yeah and it says that younger age between sixteen and forty five highly interesting features more critical. And if the only f Yeah  because our target is sixteen to forty five. Yeah you don't know how much it costs. Yeah  you don't know how much it costs  the L_C_D_ screen. No  I don't have any costs here  I only have percentages. Yeah. Yeah  if you want to adjust  like for example  adjust the audio settings  you press audio on the touchscreen and you get the buttons for audio settings  so the other buttons are gone. I think it's the most easier thing  yeah. No. Yeah. Highly. Yeah  but Um  s forty six to forty five  thirty three percent  and sixty fifty six to sixty five twelve percent. But our our our what's it  project requirements are the new products should be reached for new markets  to customers that are younger than forty. No  that not now  but  so Yeah  but market share fro for for forty years and younger is higher than that of sixty five and younger. Yeah  i i if it Yeah  if it costs gets too much  too expensive  then yeah  we should be sticking to rubber buttons. N nothing  no costs at all. Yeah  in I think that should yeah I think we all get the costs of everything. Yeah  okay  I'll I'll post it. Yeah. Okay  L_C_D_  yeah. Then you have the seventy five percent of users find it r ugly. Yeah  and eighty percent of the users would spend more money with a when a remote would look fancy. Tha i l i it'll look fancy with L_C_D_ screen. Yeah. Yeah  just a the plain remotes  not not specific L_C_D_ remotes. So Mm-hmm. Yeah  of course. And then you have the other thing  that seventy five percent zap a lot  but that's not a f question with the L_C_D_ screen. Only thing you have to do is wipe the screen off once each time  to get all the fingerprints off it. Um Mm-hmm. The most important things on a f on an on an uh remote control are channel selection  volume con selection  and power s power usage. And a teletext  but that is not of the question. Other things are Sorry? Yeah  it could be. Yeah. Yeah  teletext. And other other less important things are screen settings  audio settings  and channel settings  but Less important. Yeah  should be there  but not press Yeah  sub-menu  yeah. Yeah  in a breath it's Charted. Yeah  but we don't we don't have any costs now  so Yeah. Yeah e e power supply is one of the most important things. Yeah  I think it's it's not that easy because I don't think people will like it who who uh that you have to turn it on first and then use it  so I think it's better when th the T_V_ shuts down  the remote shuts down. Yeah. Yeah. After two minutes  yeah two three minutes  yeah. Yeah. And then b that uh before an hour when its get again gets empty. Then you have plenty of time to recharge it  of put it in a recharger. Charger. Yeah  if it's. Uh. Yeah  because when you're watching T_V_  you're zapping and you have to put it in a recharger  and I don't think it Yeah  okay  but then we have to be sure that the the the the batteries go hours  six hours  five  six hours  then. Yeah  then you have a problem. Or we have to be sure that the batteries last couple of days when they're recharged. So. Yeah because you have b but you have L_C_D_ screen. High power usage. Yes. True. Yeah. Yeah. True. Yeah  you made a point there. Yeah  otherwise all your yeah. Just a small device. Plug it in  that's it. Yeah  like a like telephone charger or something. Yeah. Yeah. It has to be easy to use also  or things. Uh market share  speaker re speech recognition. I think. Also. Well I think that this should be standard. Large button large buttons. Yeah? Okay.. Yeah  it says also Yeah. Twelve. That's an also ninety one percent sixteen to twenty five  twenty six to thirty five years  seventy six percent  and thirty six to forty five  thirty five percent. But then I I I Yeah. Yeah. Ninety. Twenty five. channel. Yeah. Yeah  twelve. Yeah. Is this only would you would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control. It's the only thing it says. I think an L_C_D_ screen should be suf sufficient. Yeah  it says a lot  but No I think I think it's better to have L_ L_C_D_ screen  because in the area of tw thirty six to forty five  we have about thirty percent of the market share in in our hands  and fifty five of those people want L_C_D_ screen and thirty five want speech recognition. So I think it's better to keep it with L_C_D_ screen. Yeah  if the costs al allow it. Nee. If it should be done  if it could be done  I won't matter. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. True. Yeah. True. But that should also be with f should be also with L_C_D_ screen. Because then I think in Chinese is different written  volume is different written than um Swahili or something. Ja  well possible. Yeah  yeah yeah yeah. 'Kay  what else? Yeah  we have to keep Yeah. I think it's difficult. Every language of dialects I think it's very differen difficult. Yeah. I think it can't be implemented  but maybe Yeah  's an option  yes. Fifty Euro cents. Yeah. Mm  yes. No  but Curved? Um. I think we should we could that we could also implement a audio settings  screen settings and channel settings  but as sub-menus. D Mainly if you turn the uh remote control on  you have to u you have to see from one till zero  channel and volume. And if you want to use teletext screen or audio  then you can press it. It should be available but not not Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  but s Yeah. They'd have to be easy to use. The sign of it. Uh  no. What else can you do with a television? Uh play  pause  doesn't n need to be there. Yes  so this is your presentation. We could check the other remote controls with technical functions. Which ones were yours? Techni Ja ja ja ja ja. Technical functions. Yeah okay. Uh I think I go to have volume  mute but I Yeah. Very slow. Yeah  the zoom buttons. Yeah  b wide screen  high screen  different things you have  yeah different uh Yeah. Yeah it should be available  but then in separate screen settings or something. Yeah  screen settings  audio settings  teletext settings you have. Channel settings. So those four  and of course the main. Yeah. Yeah. Like tap screens or something or  I dunno. Something Yeah  if uh No  you don't yu a no you then you don't no ni don't then you don't use it. Mm-hmm. Yeah. So you leave it alone. Yeah. Or it could be possible to have a a standard version of the remote  an expanded version. Yeah. Colours. Yeah. Yeah  then defines itself. Because uh how many percent? Eighty percent? Would spend more money if it looks fancy. Yeah. Rasta colours. Yeah  see through version. Yeah. If you press a button  it turns green. Channel settings? Yeah. Mm. Yeah. Could be possible. Or like uh you have a menu button  you press Yeah  or otherwise you have a menu button  press menu then you have uh main uh menu search uh all the all the settings. Yeah  no problem. Yep. Um  I think b because we don't have a lot of buttons on the one screen  I think the buttons Yeah  but but or like you have you only have channel button or volume button. Those buttons you can you can Yeah. Yeah  th No  no normal buttons  yeah. Maybe only the on and o on and off button. But I don't think Mm  no. No no no  because we we discussed that you could charge it  otherwise is it it jumps to stand-by mode automatically. Yeah  but a T_V_ of course  th that's the I think that's a best thing is that to implement that one in the menu with the volume and channel. No. Yeah  you tap. Touch screen  yeah then it's turn turn off  turn on. No  just the remote. A television don't have to be on  that one you can press on  yeah stand-by  then press on remote  press on and then T_V_ should be available. Or not. Separate. Yeah  but I think the re the remote control  if you press tap the screen  it always should jump to the screen which has the volume button  channel button  and of course of also the on and off button. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah  if we can afford it. Yeah. Mm-hmm. One question. Send. Submit. Mm. Yeah. I'll go first. Okay. I'll go first yeah. So. Huh? Okay  um Okay  um I wanted to explain the working design of the remote control. It's possibly very handy if you want to uh design one of those. Um well so it basically works uh as I uh uh r wrote down uh in this uh little uh summary. Uh when you press a button  uh that's when you do pr for example when you uh want to turn up the volume  um a little connection is made uh the the rubber uh button just presses on a on a little print plate uh which uh makes uh uh a connection that uh gives the chips  uh which is uh mounted beneath those uh that plastic of a rubber button. Uh senses that a connection has been made  and know and knows what button you pressed  becau uh for example the the volume up or volume down button. Um uh the the chip uh makes a Morse code uh like uh signal which uh then is si uh signalled to uh several transistors which makes uh which sends the signal to a little let. You know what a let is? Okay. And that makes uh the the infra-red lights signal which is sent to the television set. Uh which has a sensor in it to uh sense uh the signal of the infra-red. That's basically uh how it works. Um the findings uh uh that I found uh searching up some uh detailed information about the remote controls  are that uh they are very easy to produce  uh it is pis uh it's possible to uh make them in mass production because it is as eas it is as easy as uh printing a page  uh just uh fibreglass plate um is b uh is uh covered with uh some uh coatings and uh uh and chips. Uh and the technology's already available  we don't have to find out how remote controls uh have to work or uh how that how uh to make some chips that are possible to uh to to transmit those uh signals. Uh I made a little uh uh animation of about how a tran our uh remote controller works. we tel There. Okay. Uh well the sub-component  I suppose that you understand what a sub-component is  is f in this example it's the button. Uh when it is pressed down  um  the switch is ter is uh is switched on  so with uh the wire is sent to the to the chip in uh co-operation with the battery of course  because to make uh a a signal possible you have to have some sort of uh li uh a d ad uh electronic uh Yes  uh  okay. Um w after it's being composed by the chip uh the signal uh is transported uh to the infra-red bulb  and from there it signals a Morse code-like signal to the to the b to the bulb in uh in the television set. Okay. S Uh I wrote down some personal preferences about uh the remote control. Of course it is very handy if the remote control is hand held  so you don't have to uh uh wind it up or something  or just is it's it's very light to uh to make uh to use it. Uh I personally uh pref prefer that uh it would be p uh come available in the various colours  and uh easy to use buttons. But I suppose that the one of the other team members uh uh thought of that uh too. And it is possible for several designs and um easy to use b uh sorry  easy to use buttons. Perhaps soft touch  uh touch screen uh buttons because uh the rubber buttons are always uh uh they uh slightly uh they can be slightly damaged  uh so the numbers on the buttons are not possible uh to read anymore. And uh well as I said uh before th uh we can uh make several designs. Okay  well  that's my contribution to this meeting  and uh two of these this meeting. So. Okay. Hmm. Mm. Mm. Uh L_C_D_ screen as in uh touch screen? Okay. 'Kay. Okay. No. Yeah. Mm. Yeah for Standby options  yeah? Uh yeah. Two s two two digits  oh okay. Yeah I understand what you mean. Yeah. It makes it twelve  yeah. Indeed. Okay. Well  not really And and there are some models that don't uh accommodate that function. So d uh wh the Philip's television makes it possible in that indeed to uh press one and then two to make uh the uh tj to reach channel twelve. But uh all the television makes uh use of those button where you first press that button and then press two digits to uh to get Uh yeah  think so. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah  we we could yeah. But I think that uh that collides with our mission to make it very cheap. Because L_C_D_ screens are very expensive. A touch screen uh probably uh even more. So  true  true. But uh Well um is it possible to make an L_C_D_ screen uh  how was the information? So perhaps we should we should focus on that L_C_D_ screen. Yeah but uh will we not uh exceed our uh our uh production uh Is it possible to find out  anyway? You know? No  an L_C_D_ screen's just like uh like a drawn here. Um just uh displays several buttons  for example um if you wanted the minimal uh use b uh buttons  such as channel and volume  you just h uh displays four buttons on the screen and it's possible to p uh press them down  just like a touch screen. Yeah  we can make it possible to do that  yeah. Yeah yeah. Yeah  yeah. That's my uh Yeah. Twelve fifty. Um. Well I suppose wi if the mar if our um if the i if the young people are interested in L_C_D_ screens  we should make 'em. And if that is our d uh market share to uh and our goal to uh deliver those uh remote controls Yeah. Yeah. Mm. It's treasure. I hope we uh h and let's hope to reach those uh those sales. Yeah  can you um uh s I think that that they will send you some information about uh the cost of L_C_D_ uh screens. Uh so if you uh Yeah  so if you uh you receive an email about that  uh can you post it in the or shouldn't we post that in uh our projects mail uh folder. Because you are the the Marketing uh Expert. I uh Yeah sure  sure. Mm. It's looks fancy one yeah  of L_C_D_ screen. Mm yeah. And then not yeah. Um. Yeah. Mm. Okay? Yeah. Yeah. And there's also a A sh but in a sub sub-menu or something like that. Uh I think it's also important to uh make it possible to um how do you call it in English  uh  to not use batteries  and use ac uh bat uh batteries to uh to be yeah yeah sure. Indeed. So uh you can mount uh the the the uh uh the remote control to um to refill the Yeah. Okay  because i uh when you get an L_C_D_ screen  you run it on batteries  the batteries will be uh empty very soon  very fast. Yeah. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Uh And go to standby mode when you don't use it  so that Yeah  automatically. After two minutes or three minutes  something like that. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. No  when you when you're done with s uh w uh watching your television  you have to put it Yeah sure  of course. Yeah  but But you also forget to buy batteries  and then you can you can't use it  so I Yeah. High power user cell  i uh it should be uh a standard move to to put your remote control in the charger when you're done watching television  that's also a a a great advantage because you can't lose it anymore. Because you are obliged to uh put it in the charger and not to uh leave it in a couch uh between some cushions. Okay. Yeah it hasn't It doesn't have to be big. Yeah just just a cable  or a even a a a a a charger where you can mount it on. Something like that  just u Okay. Functional designs uh for the elderly uh you could make it possible to enlarge the screen  so make it possible to not uh display uh a button at ten points uh  or Yeah but it is uh one of the functions you have to uh specify. Because we can look at uh uh perhaps uh forty buttons at a screen  but the elderly only look at two buttons. Okay. Speech recognition? Hello. Twelve Euro twelve Euro fifty. Well  spread it by a big market. Well let's leave out all the remote controls and just put a microphone on top of the television to Yeah Yeah. Turn volume up. Hey  that that's an idea. Okay  well that should it has to be remote control  not Yeah. Sure why not why not Yeah  mm. Yeah. Perhaps the options should be uh Why not? Why not? Let's hope uh to have some uh d We should do it. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Certain systems already exist  I think. True  yeah. Yeah. This should be uh accommodated with some software  uh  uh. Yeah. Right. Swahili. Swahili. Yeah. Indeed. Yeah. So we want to uh yeah it's international uh okay. Okay. Y it should be done. If it could be done  should be done. That's not so difficult at all  because I already use on several voice operated systems  and they are all possible to uh not all  but Yeah  sure  indeed. For speech recognition. Uh yeah. S Shortcuts. Uh. Mm. Sh Yeah  just just sub-menu. Yeah. Not directly uh available. Okay. Mm. Directly available. So does it confuse uh the user? Uh. I'll search um. If you want to use teletext  you can push the teletext button and then the options uh become available. No. Menu. Mm. There are a lot of options depending uh on what kind of television you got. 'Cause if you don't got a wide screen television you don't need the uh the screen settings uh for uh Yeah and if the television does not support such uh operations Yeah. Yeah. Colours I think the main colour of the remote control is uh the colour of the L_C_D_ screen. I Because we don't want a lot a devi yeah a device self s g Okay  so use uh very uh lot of peo Adjust with phones  yes Okay. Twelve Euro fifty. Well  make it available in different colours  you mean? Sure. Red  white  blue  black. Grey. Yeah sea view  yes  Simpson's versions and Leave. Yeah. Mm. No. Uh not button Yeah sure  of course you need uh a settings button  uh or a settings option for the remote control. Just tap it. Yeah  it should be in standby mode  but A A A normal button on the remote control  or norm? Yeah  because uh when you touch the L_C_D_ screen when it is in standby mode  it should pop on. Wh uh why would it be a a need to have a normal button? Mm. I think it looks a lot more fancy if you use uh if you don't have any buttons on the s on on remote control. Oh  okay Oh. Mm. Okay. Food. Yeah  think so. Good morning  again. All set? Good. Okay. Let's see what we can find here. Okay. A very warm welcome again to everyone. Um here we are already at our uh functional design meeting. Um and this is what we are going to do. The opening  which we are doing now  um and the special note  I'm project manager but on the meetings I'm also the secretary  which means I will make uh minutes as I did of the previous meeting. And uh I also put these as fast as possible in the uh project folder  so you can see them and review what we have discussed. Um if I'm right  there are three presentations  I guess each one of you has prepared one? Good. And um we will also take a look at new project requirements  um if you haven't heard about them yet. And then of course we have to take a decision on the remote control functions and we have some more time  forty minutes. But I think we will need it. Um well I don't know who wants to go first with his presentation. You can go first  okay. Is there an order? I haven't And one question  uh your name Denni  is it with a I_E_ E_I_E_  okay. Thank you. Sorry. Yeah  it's a little bug it's in the in the smart board. Okay  thank you. Yep. Please. Okay  thank you. Okay  thank you. Um  well thank you all  huh. I dunno uh did everyone receive an email with uh the new project requirements? No? Well  then I think it's a good thing that I made a separate slide of them so you can all read them. Oh  well not in this presentation. Hmm. Should be in there. Well  I can tell you them uh from my laptop. Um teletext does has become outdated since the popularity of the internet. So that's uh the first thing we I think we should pay less attention to uh teletext. Uh the remote control should only be used for the television  otherwise the project becomes more complex  which endangers the time to market  and of course would make it more costly  I think. Um our current customers are within the age group of forty plus  and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty  and you talked about that before. And uh a last point  but also very important  our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products  which means that our uh corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design. So we have to keep that in mind. Um well uh according to our agenda it's then time to take a decision on the remote control functions. So  who has any idea about what should be on it  and what shouldn't? Yeah. Only be used for television. Well it says only for television here  huh. Makes it a lot easier  huh? Mm-hmm. Uh well new product should reach a market with customers that are younger than forty  and now we have current customers uh of forty plus. Mm-hmm. So we're going for an L_C_D_ screen? And hoping that when we produce a lot it won't be too expensive. Mm-hmm. Okay  so L_C_D_ it is? Okay. And what else? Yeah  okay. But for now it's L_C_D_. Okay. Yeah. Yeah  and maybe you can make something fancy out of an L_C_D_ remote  because it's new  as far as I know. Okay  what else does our remote need? Mute button. Mm-hmm. Yeah  and we could make an a a separate menu on the L_C_D_ uh screen for teletext. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And maybe a low battery indicator? On the screen. So we are going for the for the recharger. Okay. Yeah  also. Okay  well I've Yeah  you have some more points. And you said something about speech recognition? Even bigger than for L_C_D_. But when you look at the percentages Speech recognition scores even higher  huh? Yeah  well  maybe because of the cost  but uh nobody knows uh how much uh it will cost uh. But would it be useful to imple implement both? On one remote? Or Yeah  I dunno. So  no speech recognition? Or Yeah  and then we have different languages. Okay  just make a separate remote for each uh Okay  so we only do this when we have enough money left. Okay. Well I've written down an an on or off button  volume selection  channel selection  uh the digits from one to zero  huh. Um or from zero to nine. Uh a digits button to switch uh between one and two digits  mute button  a separate menu for teletext  a battery indicator. Um we're going to use a docking station and uh probably L_C_D_ and if there's enough money  speech recognition. And uh the possibility to uh enlarge buttons or to have large buttons in general. Okay  so not too much teletext support  but in a separate menu  and Okay  but no more buttons or functions  or? Aren't we forgetting something very important? Ping. Yeah. And a see-through uh Okay  well that's the signal for las final five minutes. Um so I have uh the things I just read. Um then we have uh separate menus for teletext  screen settings  audio settings  and what else? Channel settings. Okay. No  we said teletext also a separate menu. Okay  but we can work that out later  I guess. So we're having a a general menu with the most used functions  uh teletext  screen settings  audio settings  channel settings  and maybe there are options for the remote itself? Like uh large icons or small icons and I don't know what else  but Yeah  but on the L_C_D_  huh? Right  yeah  okay. But we don't need a special we don't need a special options menu for the remote itself. Okay. Well maybe there should be a separate button apart from the L_C_D_  because you can't turn it on when the L_C_D_ is off. So how do you turn the thing on? There has to be a on button on the remote  huh? Tap the thing. Okay. And then the television is on also  or just the remote? Sure. Okay  well Yeah. So actually we're going to create a a button-less uh remote. No buttons at all. Okay  well that's might be a unique selling point  huh for a remote. Okay  well I guess we have to postpone further discussion to uh our next meeting  because we're running out of time. Um for now  we're having a lunch break  and then there will be uh half an hour for the uh next share of individual work. I will uh write uh minutes  if I can create them out of this. And uh put them in the the project documents uh folder. And here are the individual actions for the for the other roles. And of course specific instructions will be sent to you again by your uh personal coach. Luckily as we are. Okay  well thank you very much  for now  and uh have a nice lunch  huh? ,The project manager opened the meeting and recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting. The marketing expert discussed his personal preferences for the design of the remote and presented the results of trend-watching reports  which indicated that there is a need for products which are fancy  innovative  easy to use  in dark colors  in recognizable shapes  and in a familiar material like wood. The user interface designer discussed the option to include speech recognition and which functions to include on the remote. The industrial designer discussed which options he preferred for the remote in terms of energy sources  casing  case supplements  buttons  and chips. The team then discussed and made decisions regarding energy sources  speech recognition  LCD screens  chips  case materials and colors  case shape and orientation  and button orientation. 
Yeah. Yeah  sure. It kinda does make sense  doesn't it  because when we get into the end of meeting we're kind of talking about action and design as opposed to background. Everything I have is kinda background. Mm-hmm. Uh that sounds. Sure. Okay. Sure. Yeah  cool. Why don't I get that? Hmm. Okay. Okay. Um alright so c is it function F_ eight? Hmm. Come on. I think it's working. Okay great s so let me just start this. Okay great. So um uh s move on. Uh-huh oh where'd it all go? It's not good. Okay lemme just see where I can find it. This looks more like it. I think I just opened up the template. Sorry about that. Okay alright so let's have a look here. Okay so this was the method that um I've taken. Uh basically what I wanna do here  before we get into it uh too far  is I want to show you all the background information I have that I think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful. And uh and then sorta g go through some of the way that I've dealt with that information  and then sort of bring us all together into it to see sorta see how this fits in with the overall vision. Um so I've tried to take a whole lot of market research and summarise it for us  and then ide identify uh trends that are are sort of in sync and are important to our our uh p project plan that we have so far  and then uh initiate a kind of discussion on design options so that it sorta helps us to to narrow in on on aspects that will inform other uh other elements of the of the project. Does that make sense  tha that sort of strategy? I thought that that will impact on the rest of what we do  so that's why I suggested we get in this. Okay so out of um different uh figures and ratings ob uh of people in general  um consumers in general  the number one thing that was found was that uh the br t television remote control  a fancy look and feel  okay  and not  it specified  not a functional look or or feel  uh b f f fancy. Um however  this is where we kinda have to be very  I think  creative about it. Number two was that it be innovative. Okay so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative without a adding just unnecessary um sort of functional bits to it. Uh and third priority uh for ease of use  so again that kind of gives us a general picture of how it has to be  um quite user friendly while still having technology. So it I'll just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of m marketing  is that I think um what we should think about is how the um about how the innovation uh contributes to the look and feel  and not so much to the functionality of it. For example like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up or something  you know what I mean  like  or it's got something else to it that just seems innovative because obviously the thing that the message here is ease of use. So how do you make innovation make something more more easy to use? Well that's I guess where we're gonna go with this. Okay then there's the other aspect of the back the the market um research I have here is on fashion style  okay  which as we've agreed is a priority. Uh top European fashion trend um that I read about says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables  okay  especially in clothes and furniture. And when I first saw that I thought hmm  well do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it  or we get right into it  or we completely steer away from it  do you know what I mean? So my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend  but we want to think also about the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics. Um 'cause I think what we're in what we're in is partly sort of home decor  partly something like a computer  um so I think we might wanna be careful about how you know how quickly we create like a remote control in the shape of an apple or something  I think that would be pushing it. And then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and sort of  you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle  which is which also in indicated that last year this was this was not the case. So um probably a lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year's mode  so if we try and really capitalise on that  I think that'll be in our favour. Um So these this is the summary of everything. Um style is number one uh thing in the in the market of who we're selling to. Uh innovative design technology's also a must in that it's seen it'd be seen to be uh cutting edge  uh but ease of use t has to be insured throughout. That was like the number three thing. And then at the end there are vibrant natural colours um that's the way I interpreted it anyway  softness in materials  shape  and function  and so I've written at written at the bottom to give us sort of a context of discussion  Mac iPods  something which is  I'd have to say very high-tech  ten gigabytes  whatever  but when you hold it in your hand there's like no buttons. You know what a Mac iPod is? I'm thinking however Mac iPod is sort of last year's because it's very hard and sort of glassy and glossy  so I'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of a Mac iPod and we're then making it s more of like a more of like a comfortable type of or more of like a maybe more vibrant to friendly thing to have. Um and then so this is w with all that information what I'm what I'm suggesting in this slide here is that we we take these ideas  and as we get into more the more um techni like sort of production side of things  that we think about shape  materials  and themes or series that go throughout. Sort of like a I dunno like um we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all  that we agree on  uh sorta like a marketing identity. Um Does that make sense? Yeah. So so like I threw out a few ideas there just to kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon  lime  I dunno  green colours  pe whatever  it's just an idea  'cause I'm thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their what people associate this them with in terms of texture  shape  colours  things like that. Like um the ones the ones which I'm most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like um like lemon or something like that  you know something which is  like you see a lot in in other areas. Like I see lots of websites and things that seem to associate with like lemon and lime and So anyway it's just just an idea. I'm thinking maybe we could incorporate some of these features into a fairly um into something which is which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky because like um like something to do with like lighting within it. Like you know just within the simple sense  when you pick up a phone and touch a button it uh lights up  q usually the buttons light up. How can we build on that? Maybe like it could light up in different colours or something or or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like covers or something so. Anyway those are that's all I have  but uh hopefully we can we can revisit those ideas when we get into Yep. Did you press F_ eight? Yeah. Okay  do we have a corporate colour scheme? I didn't know. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Great. Lots of good information there. It's a shame the cable wasn't just in the middle of the table  huh? Just um It takes a second  doesn't it? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. They're standard  aren't they? Yeah. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Hmm. No. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. It can't be curved. Okay. Uh question on can I ask a question? Okay. Can we uh power a light in this? Can we get a strong enough battery to power a light? Okay. So maybe one of the things we can just try and include is a really good battery. Well I mean I'm thinking it might be That for uh this to be a high-tech thing it's gonna have to have something high-tech about it and that's gonna take battery power  and to make that to make that a realistic goal I think one of the issues that will come up later is  can the battery power it? Illuminate the buttons. Yeah it glows. Well m I'm thinking along the lines of you're you're in the dark watching a D_V_D_ and you um you find the thing in the dark and you go like this  and that's what everybody does. Oh where's the volume button in the dark  and uh y you just touch it  or you just pick it up  and it lights up or something. Like a phone  yeah yeah. Whereas with phones  people charge them once a week. We're gonna need to put in a really good battery so people don't have to charge their r remote control every few days. But are people gonna wanna shake their movie controller? Right. Sure. Okay. Right. Mm-hmm. Okay  great. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. What's that? Yeah. Okay. Well I mean I'm thinking that what we need to do is have something that kind of unifies a lot of the different concepts  and if we think that what we are w our number one marketing motive is um the look and feel. So for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion  then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sorta can visualize. Um maybe what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back to the on the um the colour  you said company colour yellow. I mean if we think of something  like I was saying also lime and lemon you know  what can we come up with something where we we try and associate it with with like the series. We just come up with something like that we kind of use it as a theme to inspire the shapes and things. Yeah. Yeah. No no no not at all. It's more more just that we we think about like what it is we're trying to achieve  so and then we have one one sorta theme that we stick with. Do you know what I mean? Right  sure. Yeah. Um can we yeah like to and wha like do you have a Can you like yeah just t we can visualize it. Okay. Okay. Yep. Mm. What would it achieve? Well L_C_ well I'd when you used to mention the L_C_D_ I'd think I wonder what that would be about. And the th the thing I could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with um listings. So as you scroll through  'cause we said we might have a jog dial  so as you scroll through your stations you can y it actually tells you what it is. Right  okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm not real Mm-hmm. No. Mm mm. Well i I was just Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  sure. Um I've had kinetic things before  and the the the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that you're committing the user to moving it  and watches yeah Sure  okay  right  okay. Support for it. I mean just it's just worth pointing out because like I've I've known I've known people to have kinetic watches that they wear all the time  and it's just like magic because it's always powered and there's no battery. I've also known people to have things like like a jewellery watch they wear from time to time  and they eventually just say it's just too much of a nuisance because I don't wear it all the time. Like remote control is similar  you're away on vacation  I dunno whatever  you something  and it just starts to get worn down. So we should think about Yeah. Yep. And this size here  I'd suggest this be small  like quite small. Um just a a lot of the um I mean one of the things running through my mind right now  I realise we're being efficient to wrap up the meeting and have lots of decisions made  um but we are leaning quite a bit to the side of being low-tech  rubber buttons plastic frame  it's almost like we're reproducing the same old remote control that's out there. Should we think about how we are actually getting this high-tech user friendly uh um theme like what is it that we're u we're using to to achieve those goals? Like Okay so so backlighting  that would be good. Yeah clear  that'd be Okay. Yeah sure. Yeah that'd be really good. Yeah. Sure. Yeah  yeah. Yeah. Sure. Yeah they they emanate a light through it. 'Kay. Yeah  mm-hmm. Um and then the other thing that we we're s we've committed ourselves to achieving is simplicity  and so I'm thinking maybe should we try and think about having something like um some kind of an innovative concept about how the um the volume and the channels are controlled  'cause that's the main thing people will f wanna do. Could we use like a jog dial  like a nice just sort of round  somewhere on it where you just roll it? Or Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well why don't we do it like a mouse then? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah  sure. Mm. Yeah. But that's not a bad thing is it? Because when you think about it  the alternative is to go push the button. Jog dials are much easier than that. You just roll. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah like I mean if we if if we keep coming back to this board here  I wouldn't be surprised if we could take this idea  imagine that  I dunno  that it's within the shape of the hand  it's quite small I dunno. Yeah. It's small  and that we've got like the the l slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side  and that yeah well I mean isn't that what we just h said said we s just have to decide now? Yeah. And then like a jo And then like a jog dial somewhere that fits in with the shape of it like I dunno like here  in with the It would get bumped  it's doesn't really fit with your hand. Yeah. Or maybe just fit it in like down the middle here. A jog di Yeah. It's kind of yeah Yeah. Huh. Um Yeah I think the jog dial  you know it just after you drew that  what if it was flat and you just spun it  that'd be great. Yeah. Yep. Sure  yeah  yeah and materials we sorta said we'd do plastic and rubber  didn't we  and I think maybe we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons  'cause that'd just be so standard. Something a bit more flush  yeah  or maybe have rubber incorporated into the case as well  so that it has and also t plastic I've seen can get really textured  so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand. They feel kind of like um  you get pens now and then that you'd think that they were rubber but they're not  they're actually just plastic that's textured  kind of a little bit like Okay. Okay. Is it working? And so think of this concept. Um to research it I've um had a look on the the homepage again. It's provided me with more examples of um previously existing c remote controls. Um there's a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there  um so I've taken the um suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this um So then this we're looking for um suggestions on size th um size of control and the buttons  um the shape of the control  and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control. Um what I found from the research is that most the current controls are just basically big bricks with loads of buttons all over them. Um they're not very attractive to look at  and they're not very comfortable to hold  they're I just hold 'em like big bricks  and they're very easily lost. Um they tend to be very dark colours  so if there are shadowy places down the side of couches you can't really see them. Um the the controls themselves tend to use a very inconsistent colour scheme. Um for instance  the stand-by button isn't always red  uh it really should be. It's uh something the user then uh identify with. This is a red switch off  that's how it should be. Um I'm not sure if there's any other examples of that  but something to look out for. Um there's a problem that I've I've got couple of preferences for the the end control um I get 'em with the the red colour button for stand-by and s the other examples of that um The buttons should be large. They shouldn't be tiny little things like you get on some mobile phones. They should be easy to press  very comfortable. Um one of the examples given on the homepage was um there's an up and down volume button but both of them have a V_ on them  so the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button  that's kinda confusing. Um should avoid s things like that. Um if the the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere. Um obviously trying trying to avoid being tacky there  but it could um tie-in very easily with your your lime and lemon idea. Fantastic. Um any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be m hidden  they shouldn't be on the um shouldn't be visible without something be opened or some sort of special extra effort. Um if we did decide to go for voice activation there sh should always be a button as alternative  possibly hidden in the the opened up section um making that something is wrong with it or with somebody's voice  maybe they got a cold or Um we should definitely avoid the big square block look. That's just wrong. And um we got an email uh from I think it's the the research department  and they've said th the voice control um can now talk back if you ask it a question. So it sh it could be good to have them um confirm any action you take and possibility. Right and these are problems I've had with it. Um I don't know where the slogan should go  or really what the slogan is. I think it's um  fashion into electronics. And we don't know how flexible the colour scheme is. I mean you say you wanted the the corporate colours  but they don't say you know if we can use any other colours at all or That's it. I think I'm cool. Right. Right. Um I think we could go for like um maybe not a p a fruit shape but a very sort of curvy type shape. Um you could have the same sort of texture and colour as a fruit. Um probably something that s sits in your hand comfortably  sort of feels right in your hand. See I'm I'd quite like a sort of uh snowman type shape. Um so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand  and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need. Um something like that um you got two groups there um maybe it could fold up and you get a third group inside or uh you have volume controls about there. So I reckon it'd look quite nice if we just had um this here  had a sorta background yellow  and then have sort of a nice bold colour for the buttons. I think that might scare me. I think that'd probably scare me. You turn it on your control possessed s. Um Nah. Um well I think the advanced ones the the ones you don't usually use could be hid inside. B um I think the we had were fairly basic ones  they'd have to go on the the front somewhere. Um Yeah I think so yeah. Mm. Well  but then for um for skipping a large amount of channels you do have to uh to skip the channel button  the number part. Uh but Yeah. Mm. Okay. Okay  well Okay. Okay we all ready to go? Well how um on the in this meeting then if we um I'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting. And we uh decided on decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five  and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered  that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories  um. And I told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext  ignoring everything except the T_V_  and trying to incorporate the the uh corporate colour and slogan. Um so that was the last meeting. Is there anything have I forgotten anything? Is that everything? Okay. Um so if we have the three presentations  and then if you have anything to kind of that you know you're gonna want to discuss  maybe just make a note of it  and we'll have all the discussion at the end. That might be a better idea this time. And so if we start off uh with Andrew and then Craig and then David  if that's alright. Um and then after that we'll have to make some decisions about stuff  right. So if you wanna take this. Screwed in quite tightly. Uh what did uh how did we leave it with speech recognition now? We did we say we were gonna try maybe incorporate it but we hadn't made a definite decision on that? Right. Oh I should also point out that um the you know the kind of final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product. So um that's kind of the end result hopefully. Uh-huh. Hopefully appear in a wee second. Up there we go. Oh no. Oh right. Here we go. Okay. Mm-hmm. Aye a fair point definitely. Okay. Aye right. Uh-huh. Okay. Okay okay. Mm-hmm. Mm that's true  yeah. Mm 'kay. Great. Okay. Yeah. Ah. Okay. That's great. Uh-huh. Okay great. Um thank you for that. Uh Craig do you wanna uh plug yours in then? Mm. Not quite. Oh something coming now  yeah. There we go. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. I think it's yellow because like the website is yellow and there's a band at the bottom is yellow  so yellow  lemon  you know definitely food for thought there  but keep going and we'll discuss it after. Mm-hmm. Mm 'kay. Mm. Aye that's a good idea  yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Yeah that that was very good  and uh now with David. I know it'd be handy  wouldn't it. Do y do you wanna sit in the the line of sight of this um Yeah. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. We you couldn't have like plastic and rubber? Yeah. Mm 'kay. Okay. Mm-hmm. I'll clear one of these things for you. Just by moving it yeah. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm. W yeah. Uh yeah yeah  I see. Yeah. I know what you mean yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm. Okay. Okay. Right. Okay. Right can I Yeah well yeah it's just I'm quite keen to get the discussion going with the time we've left so but yeah you c ask away. Mm. Why what kind of light do you want are you thinking of? Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah yeah yeah. Like a phone yeah  like the backlight in a phone. Okay cool. Yeah. Mm. Mm. Okay. Okay. Right okay um well let's just go right back to the marketing ideas for a start  and just giving an id idea on the time  we've got about fifteen minutes to play with at most. So um yeah so just t to bear in mind that the ultimate goal of this meeting is to reach an decision on the the the concepts of the product. So back to your idea about um incorporating the idea of like fruit and veg  and the corporate colour  and things like that. Um I mean what does everybody think about Does anybody have any ideas of about how we can fit all that in together? I mean that's kind of the user interface type of thing  what are your thoughts on that? So maybe do y are we thinking something that like s could sit in your hand comfortably  or do you th you'd hold onto comfortably or So something quite curvy? Okay um right okay. Colour-wise I mean you made a re uh was it you or uh I can't remember who made the point about how if you've a nice bright colour you'll not lose it  was that Whose about how if you have a bright colour you'll not lose it so much. Um and when the corporate colour is yellow  I mean maybe we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow I don't know. Um And then obviously the uh the materials when it has anybody got like an overall picture in their mind about what what might work? That's all. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Right. Oh you know like in circular in shape or Choice of material yeah. 'Cause I I I was kinda thinking about as well you know how you get these shock resistant mobile phones  and they're plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside  and it kinda feels it feels kind of warmer to the touch. It feels a bit more comfortable  and maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber into it. And then then we could have curved shapes  'cause wood or titanium  yeah  it's gonna have to be boxy and rectangular and I think we might be moving away from that you know so um Well I'm do we really want it in like the shape of a lemon or no I don't think we do either. Okay right well um so thoughts about the actual shape of the thing. A snowman shape? Uh-huh. That's quite a distinctive shape  that would be good wouldn't it. Yeah so yeah should we go with that? Do you wanna draw it on the board? Ooh that'd be good. Mm-hmm. So call it the snowman-shape trademark. Yeah that's cool. Um and I mean colour-wise what does everybody think? I think it is quite important to get yellow in there somewhere. I mean do you want the whole thing yellow  maybe like yellow and white do you want something Uh-huh. Okay cool. Um and also I mean how are we going to incorporate the slogan in? The fact that it talks to you  I mean it might be quite cool if when you first start using it it says  what is it  putting fashion into electronics or something  I dunno. Or when you like or if you turn it off or something if it can speak if it could actually say the slogan it might be a bit more powerful than just having it written on it somewhere. I d I d any thoughts on that at all? I know. Um unless an a I mean if you also would that work if we wanted to incorporate um an L_C_D_ display  where would we put that? Would we put that on the inside or It's bound to increase the cost of it a lot  I would've thought. Yeah. Mm oh yeah that's true. Yeah. So so no need for an L_C_D_ display? I think that would make it very complex. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know if there is really  no um I would say no need for a talk-back. Uh does anybody disagree with that? No? Easy. Okay um right so you're gonna have the three different sets of of functionalities  um I mean do you wanna group them into s head of the snowman  body of the snowman  inside of the snowman  is that what you're thinking? Okay. Okay right um what else do you need to talk about? So I'm just gonna um pop this in here 'cause I have a slide about decision making which I'd forgotten about. Oh sh God we've got five minutes um okay uh back we go. Um energy what do you think that's suggesting we're how we're powering the thing? I really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back-up of the battery  but have have kinetic power  I mean what does anybody think about that? Okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Well I suppose that if you're if you're away and you're not using it  then you're not using any power either. So you'd have the battery as the kind of to keep it ticking over idea I'm really sorry we're gonna have to wrap up quite quickly  we don't have as much time as I thought. Um so I think that's what energy is referring to here. Chip on print  is that that's an industrial design thing  is it David? Okay um as for the case  kind of discussed that Yeah I know we're gonna have like rubber buttons that feel kind of Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm 'kay. Could have things like backlighting the buttons and stuff like that. Aye that would be a good idea. S so like cur slightly transparent case  so it's yellow  like tinted yellow  but you can maybe see through it. Is that what you mean? Okay. Lights. Okay. Mm. Yeah. Yeah if you are holding it in your hand you could you could do that  couldn't you? If you're holding it in your hand you could Do you think? Okay. Mm. Yeah okay okay um Yeah. Okay. Okay. Just Okay um right well wouldn't it we do need to make a decision on whether we want to incorporate a jog dial in nice and quickly. Um I'm all for them actually  I think they're quite you know th very quick to m to use. So does anybody oppose the idea of of incorporating one into the design at all? No. And the other thing was um can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing? Uh-huh. Uh-huh ooh okay  we really gotta wrap up so yeah. Okay well if we can do that  great. Yeah okay. Yeah let's let's try and get the slogan on there um  and Mm. Okay. Right I'm gonna have to I'm really gonna have to hurry you on here 'cause we're we're actually over time. Um is there anything anybody's unsure about? Just for in closing just the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes  and so you can see in the screen here what each of you are gonna hopefully be doing  uh I know that the designers are gonna be working with Play-doh on that. So um that'll be that'll be good. Um and I'll get the the minutes up as soon as possible. Anything at all you think we haven't discussed that we need to? Is everybody kind of happy about what they're gonna be doing? Okay. That's kind of a design thing that you guys can can discuss  yeah. Okay. Yeah. To make something flush with the case? Okay right. Okay. Sp kinda grippy? Okay. Okay I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to call this to a close 'cause we're way over time. So um that's really good  like we've s had much to talk about that um pretty much run out of time to do so. So off you go and design stuff wooh. Yeah quite jealous actually. 'S to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your stuff is  so in that sense so it does kind of make sense  yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. Mm-hmm. No. Yep. Mm-hmm. Yep. It's probably not sending. Yeah. Yep  there it is. And the Play-Doh 's yellow. Cool. Mm-hmm. Mm 'kay um. Oops. Yeah okay. Let me just get this going first. Ah there it is. 'Kay  that should be it. Okay um I guess the same thing again  I started with something very basic. So just so you guys have some idea of what's involved in my process  um and then you can just work through it and we 'll either modify it or start from scratch um depending on what your needs are. Um the components are exactly the same. Um I think  like what you guys said  um the most input that's needed is basically in the user interface. The rest of the components um they do have an impact in terms of cost and complexity. Um like you said time to market was a problem  um and how many components are physically in there in cost. And the power is basically a factor of that. Um and the lower components  the power  the logic  the transmitter  and the infrared  um they affect you in terms of the size of your device  um and that would have some inte impact on how y I think more how you hold rather than um the actual use using the the remote control because um like we've said we've defined  like we only want the basic things that to be visible  and the rest of them we try to hide. So um you know it's just a matter of working out space. So I guess three things  um cost  um complexity  and the size. These are the three things that um will have an impact on you. So just go through it in the components. Um these are the options that are available to you  um I'm not very sure about the voice thing 'cause I got another email and it was in fact quite sketchy on what n the voice options are. Um it said it could talk to you  but it never said anything about being able to listen. I it said something about a sensor but never clarified that. So maybe if you well I could see the other email that they sent you  um 'cause they got back to me with like different requirements  or different offerings of what components availa Okay so your basic components are buttons  okay and you have a wheel available  like a mouse scroll wheel  okay there's an L_C_D_ display  um I think these are quite standard things. No um they're well in the sense that these are all the options available for you. I'll explain to you the complexity and the cost thing again a bit later. Okay um then there's um how the case actually looks. It can actually be flat or it can be curved  um and then the different types of materials that you can use  um I don't think you can use them in a combination  um but um I could check back for you  but I don't think you can actually use them in a combination. Um I think plastic and rubber would be fine  but plastic  rubber  and wood  I wasn't I'm not very sure about the titanium. They had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium. Um the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use  but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing  so I think that there is some restriction on um I think you could probably group plastic and rubber together  wood and titanium  but you know it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one. You know as opposed to two. Um and the other components are logic chips  um again I'll I'll go back to the component chips. The com how complex or how easy the logic is  it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit um and that impacts cost. Um I don't think the logic chip has a issue about size 'cause they should be about the same size. Power consumption should be about the same. Um I think the main impact is complexity  um and the other thing is um the power options. Um the first one is a standard battery. Okay the second one I think is more of a gimmick then actually a useable thing  it's a wind-up you know  a crank. Yeah but that that might be something I think that's more of a look and feel decision because I don't think you can have one power source if you're using the alternative power sources. I think whatever it is you still need a battery 'cause I don't think anybody wants to keep doing one thing. Okay the other ones are a solar powered cell  which may not be a great idea in Europe or any country that has seasons 'cause half the year you'd be dead. So like what I said  you probably need like a battery and something else. Um and the kinetic one I guess for me is the most interesting one because it's movement and people like to fiddle with their and it's a nice sales gimmick I think. From a marketing gimmick it it's a technology thing  it's a shake it it doesn't work  shake it  knock it or something. You know you know you have you had those balls  you know those stress balls where you bounce the ball and it and it lights up and it goes  you know that might be a gimmick combined with rubber. You know just to if you get frustrated wi remote control you can throw it  kind of you know just uh you know um so. Um okay my from my role  I don't think that personal preferences but role preferences  I think um something comfortable to hold  um small and slim I guess that's more in the sense of small and slim in terms of comfortable not so small you can't  you know like a phone or something  too small phone. Um and the other thing is from a production point of view um the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit. Um and also the time to market and the complexity of developing designing and debugging it um so. Um okay let me just go back and talk about some of the restrictions. Um The user interface restrictions basically means that if you use more complicated features  like the buttons are standard okay  the L_C_D_ panel and the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic. Um the case okay with a rubber case you can't have the solar panels. Okay with the titanium case  let me just check that um  titanium case can't be curved  it has to be square. Okay um there's no restriction on the plastic  and it can't be curved on the wood. So that's again  I don't think you can use them in a combination  um especially the titanium I I suspect they're very fixed to a particular need. So um mixing them may not be a good idea um yep. That's it. Um I think we could because the L_C_D_ panel requires power  and the L_C_D_ is a form of a light so that Are you thinking are you thinking of of a light in the sense of um a light light  or a light in the sense of it glows kind of you know Frankenstein  it's alive. Okay. Okay. Okay. Um that's why I think the option of the the kinetic thing which basically means as long as you shake it like a watch  like an automatic watch um it's probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it. So you could trigger that to a light  like I said the bouncing ball thing  or you could trigger that to use that to power the light as opposed to so when they pick it up  right  and then that that sorta triggers the glowingness. I think he made that. Is there a particular shape that you're interested in? Like does marketing have any research on does it need to be long? Does it need with a square thing wha Yeah 'cause that will n help narrow down the choice of Like fruit. I'm thinking fruits in my head  but that's tacky. Do we need an L_C_D_ display? What what's the functionality of that? Yeah but the question is what are we using it what would we what would we achieve from it? Putting in lights is cheap but putting in an L_C_D_ panel just to make it glow is a bit of a Mm-hmm. I think that will be a problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it  so um it's a bit nuts to get the Monday Tuesday Wednesday you know. Um I I'm not saying there's no need for an L_C_D_ display  but um it's what's what what would it tell the user  'cause the L_C_D_ tends to be an output as uh as opposed to an input so um does the remote control need to talk back to the user? We have the option of the speaker as well the sa the same thing goes for the speaker  is there a need for the remote control to to talk back? Um You could put a game on it. When the T_V_ dies you can play with the remote control. Where would you physically position the buttons? Um I think that that has some impact on on on many things. Um maybe you wanna draw onto the Yep. No  like I said we have a h hybrid kind of thing  so it's not gonna charge the battery  it's just Yeah. Yep. Yes yes. Or even a clear case. Um you know a a glowing a a glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable  but in the dark it sort of  it's alive. Um in in a slight subtle way. Yeah yeah. Yeah. Or or there might be a light running through it like a mouse. You know you have cordless mice and they don't eat that much power right. So the power the battery in that sense  maybe you have one or two stratig strategically placed lights that sort of Yeah but because the case is transparent so it gives it a little bit of a glow  doesn't make it freaky. The question is when you're rolling it  how do you wanna roll it? Do you want 'em to roll it like that? Do you want 'em to roll it like that? 'Cause in a mouse your hand's in a position to roll it  whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way  it tends to get moved accidentally. That's a very unnatural motion to yeah. Can you imagine you have to scroll a lot. Um it might work for volume  and maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that  but not for channels right. If you have a Telewest box you've got like  you don't have to buy all the channels  you've about fifty channels  can you imagine trying to. Um and I don't think having that you know too quick too slow kin it's confusing to the I dunno. But users tend to tend to want to use that and once they lose out on the user experience they're like Because that's becomes the most accessible thing in front of Yeah. So you wanna expand the shape of the That that might have one problem in terms of um in terms of whether you're left handed or you're right handed you might be locking yourself in. Could I just could I just jump in and suggest something quickly? Um I think one thing would be the jog dial 'cause that's gonna have quite a big impact on the thing um Yeah that's what I was thinking the a slide  because then you you don't have to put the hand. I think incorporating a logo is quite straight forward. There's lots of space for it um Yeah but it's also a a marketing and a function Yeah. Feel like fruit. Fruits kids. No like Yeah yeah. Yeah yeah kinda like that yeah. Play-doh time. You got to choose first. No  we're kidding. Okay  can I just swipe your power cable  I don't think it matters. Okay lemme okay  I'm gonna pull everybody out first and then put in whoever needs to be left. It's you. Argh. This is a real hassle and a oops. I'm gonna take the microphones  'cause it's too lazy t take them off again. Cool. ,The Project Manager reviewed new requirements for the project with the group and discussed their implementation. The Industrial Designer presented the basic components of a remote control device and how they work together. He showed that the size of the chip they will use is dependent on how many complicated functions are included. The User Interface Designer stressed that the project should focus on a simple design for the device. The group discussed not being able to include a teletext component  and that the product design would have to be the main selling point of the device. The Marketing Expert discussed his marketing strategy for the project  again stressing the attractiveness of the product design. The Industrial Designer proposed including a battery charging stand with the device but it was decided that it was not a useful feature. The group continued to discuss the marketing strategy for the device as it would not include many advanced technological functions; they discussed including a guarantee for the remote and using a unique form factor. 
All set? Okay. Cool. Right. So um basically I'm just gonna go over real quickly um some news I've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this um remote control. And then I'm gonna turn over to you guys to make brief presentations um on what you've found and then we'll have a bit of discussion. So basically uh what I've just found out from the board I dunno if you guys got this email as well but it needs to be television only. So no we're not doing D_V_D_  we're not doing anything else  it's just gonna be a television remote. Um it also needs to have the company colours included in it. Um so that's red and black. And it has to have the slogan  case you guys forget the slogan it's  we put fashion in electronics. Um and no teletext. I'm not sure what teletext is but I'm assuming you guys do  so we don't wanna include that um in this particular design. For reasons that I don't really know. There's but it's the board so there you go. So basically um given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later I mean 'cause it's television only we'll be able to change our uh um well we can s sacrifice more function for a better television remote. Anyway. So I'm gonna turn over to the Industrial Designer uh to go ahead and make a presentation on Oh  right yeah. Yep. Might have to hit function F_ eight but it looks like it's gonna come up. Yep. Cool. Brilliant. 'Kay. Mm. 'Kay. Fair enough. 'Kay. Is is there a way that we can use um modern types of polymers  or mo modern types of plastics that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value um like if a white like if we talk about like well like on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice  you can do i is there some kind of nice colo der quality plastic that we can work with? Okay  okay. Great. Thank you very much Nathan. Um if next we can have the um User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that'd be great as well. S plug yourself in here. Mm. Um hit function F_ eight real quickly  hold down Mm. There you go. Sweet. Yeah sorry I couldn't get that g to use before. Oh yeah look at that. Mm-hmm. Nice. Okay. Great. Thanks for that Ron. 'Kay yep that's you. Give it a little bit. That's great. Thank you Sarah. Right. So um yep I'll just uh switch that back here. I'll finish up with just a bit of discussion plan on for the next phase. Right so I think we've covered most of these important questions through this um through you guys's presentations um we've got uh y the Industrial Designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic. Um Sarah  she's recommended that we go for simpler functions  so fewer functions um but we need to decide who are we selling this to  you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted  thought about voice control  um so do we wanna go for that  or do we want to go for an older demographic  and my thought is um we've got w if we're gonna go for a sleek look I mean we are putting the fashion in electronics um. Yes. So maybe this we should look into this younger demographic. Um. So uh we need to wonder ah h about how we make it better and smaller and faster um think we're constrained to plastics very well  we've got this idea  Ron was saying we need to think about uh revolutionising the way it's looking um  which might be easier given that we're going for simpler function and that we're only going for a telly. Um so um. How th this voice operation thing is I think is a good idea um assuming that it's doable  um at least for the basic controls  maybe we can balance it that way  you know we can see. Okay you can't say record alias tonight at seven P_M_ but we might be able to say um volume up. Mm. Right. The difficulty wh would be in um I think like i you couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find. 'Kay you have something that picks up a voice from far away If it's hidden under the couch but then again you have this wee this wee thing you know that's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button  maybe that could be voice activated too. Yeah. Or an isolated magnet or something like  or you know something that wouldn't interfere I don't know that'd be the technical thing but yeah I like that  I like that  the voice recognition for the paging system. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Mm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Okay. Absolutely. Mm 'kay um well yeah I guess we'll cross that bridge um in a la slightly later stages of development um but yeah I know  that's perfectly viable question. Mm 'kay um so I'm seeing that we're gonna just basically focus on this young demographic group  aim it at them  but then in a sense that its bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them but basically we'll make a sleek simple functioned um uh remote control. Um I think this voice recognition thing is a we've got a market for it uh I don't think there's too many  we'd more or less be cornering the market on it as well  we don't have many um. I appear to have lost my microphone. Mm. Right um we don't have many people or there's not very many competitors out there that do that so cool. Um right. I guess we've c we've touched on most of this. The idea of a paging function  a touch screen  and face plates. Um. The thing with I see would there not be a we'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen? Okay. Okay. Okay. Mm. Okay. Okay. Right. Yeah 'cause then ha you would have to who all it's not like with cell phones like where you have a you know Nokia model X_ and then ten people make face plates for it  we'd be just our model of pho of t remote control. Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Alright well we can we can discuss that one further when we think about um whether th when we do costs and so forth  um. True  if plastic is dead cheap and if we're making the whole thing out of plastic anyway um yeah we'll cross that bridge later um but yeah we will have to evaluate what's most important. Um I think we've had a bit of discussion already on this thing  n s there any other questions comments that came up in these presentations? Yeah yeah okay. Um Yeah I think that would be best. Let's based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let's go for a plastic built or uh b plastic cased 'cause tha tha that's easy on the cost  try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic as you recommended and I think that's a great idea. With a touch screen for the basic functions. Um And we'll yeah tha let's provisionally let's go for a touch screen one with several submenus um for possible extra stuff that one basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen. Um do we have Mm wait a minute it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls. Yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost. Mm-hmm. But then again that costs as well. Hmm. Do they? Okay. Well I I don't think yeah I can't see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in so we'd have to see some kind of new battery technology. Okay so let's go with a um touch screen with um some kind of you know with with some kind of cutting edge battery technology Yeah well hey you know well it's it's worth looking into  if not we can always default to just doing a a well presented plastic simple you know so you know. Well yeah I mean you can put the we could I I dunno I mean I suppose we could put the the basics on the centre easiest you know  you know people know the channel and volume function make them large and easy to get at and then the the other the other bits and bobs you know go through menu um w we'll do the aesthetics. Okay so we'll touch screen and the battery  focus on um uh presentation. Um it's th uh with this voice recognition option as well um just as for the simple functions the um the on off  channels  volume  um and um a small paging function. Even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that's just a I guess another infrared signal to the remote control and while to emit some kind of paging. Just a beep. Um right so any comments? Thoughts before we break into go into the next round of individual work on this. W it's my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control. Yeah I think perhaps good idea but yeah I think that that one m might just be um and they just yeah I think that one might just be out of the range for this particular a P_D_A_ would they would makes a lot of sense for a P_D_A_ 'cause you're gonna be using it to connect up to things anyway but I dunno  what do you guys think? Hmm. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah I know I d it seems like it would suffice to have just the R_R_ on there. Jus But apparently not. So. Yeah. Well fair enough. Um and yeah that would help the battery life too and if it the remote they do have to press a button for the remote to turn on. But then again who wants to turn on a remote control. Kind of if i Oh to wake up okay or go into like a dormant mode. Okay. Oh yeah I like that I like the idea of um putting the logo in the boot up screen  nice. Um. Um cool so any last things before we break? Alright. Fair enough. Sounds good. I'm gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders. I'm gonna save a copy of this and the minutes that I'll do it in a second and put them in the shared folder for later reference. Brilliant. That's fab guys. Cool. Okay. So do I unplug this bit here? Okay. Right. That's page one of my presentation. So the uh method. We're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project. Um remote control works as follows. This is all pretty basic stuff you guys. Um sends message to another system  so there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power  something along those lines  there's an integrated circuit  which is the microchip  um and that actually compose the messages and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system. A user interface controls the chip  basically that's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well. So my findings  um I just did a preliminary study here and uh I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands. And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals. Um too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like  and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer  just think of those lawsuits  that'd be really bad. Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction. Um  components. Just some ideas that I had  um  energy source  it's kinda hip to be eco friendly so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup. Um the user interface  I was since we can't use metal I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic. The chip  um  silicon based chip I don't really see any way around that  we can't really be different in that respect. Um  the sender well I'm thinking infrared 'cause it is the industry standard  multi channel  that's a word I made up  I don't really know what it means. Uh PAL and N_T_S_C_ compatible and uh probably a two hundred foot range. Uh and the receiver of course is any number of electronic devices. Um but in this case it'll only be T_V_s. Um personal preferences  I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal  um  the company simply can't afford this kinds of lawsuits which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value  'cause we were thinking Right. Yeah that shouldn't be a problem. Um for example the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do. That's the end of my presentation. Is it plugged in well? There it goes. Computer adjusting. Mm. Mm. Right. I think it would be possible to uh combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology. With a simple command like locate. And then it could start to beep and therefore be found. Oh yeah I think that's very doable. Mm. It's a good point. Yeah. Mm. I was thinking uh Oh go ahead. Yeah. Gotta wonder though  if we're adding so much technology to this one remote  are we still gonna be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty Euro you know goal for selling these things. It seems like  we're not gonna be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip. The microchip is probably the most expensive part of the the whole mechanism. So it's just something to consider. Back to the uh the cost the material. We have to ask whether we're going to include a certain number of face plates with the package? That's something I w for say we're including three or four face plates  it's gonna drive the cost up. And the other question is  if we do include them are we really in a position to evaluate that market? We haven't done any tests on face plates and whether See if there if there's even interest out there. Off the top of my head it sounds kind of like a gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere. Yeah. Can we afford to include one of those? Right. Okay. Since we're doing uh touch screen  do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that? Or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody. What what would be on that touch screen? 'Cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and um logo or something or motto  I can't remember exactly what you said. 'S too much. Think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen. That'd be okay. Mm. True. People aren't gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on. They just want it to be on and ready to go. Th Well so. Here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation. Um so a few of the requirements we need here. Uh we n basically need to operate an electronic device  it needs to be universal um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices although we now uh find that uh that that's no problem. Um so some of my findings. Um basically wanna send messages uh to a television set. Um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television  uh switch to the next channel  that sort of thing  I think we're all quite uh quite uh intelligent and know know what a normal remote control does. Um now some of the other things I found is a a complicated remote control sorry that we can't quite see my red there very well but uh this remote control has many functions um so it can do a lot of things but it uh it is quite complicated and most users will find it uh find that they won't use most of the functions because they don't know how to use them and don't wanna take the time to learn how to do it. As you also notice it's quite a boring design. Um. Another remote control  slightly different  it's a simpler remote control uh many less buttons but uh has many fewer functions  um m much easier for the user to manipulate and use. Um it also has a bit of a cheap look and it's also quite boring. So my personal preferences. Revolutionise the idea of uh a remote control. Um so attain the functionality of a complicated device but use a simple formatted display uh for the user to to work with. And I was gonna add another uh slide here but I didn't quite have time there. Um. Just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like uh having multiple face but it's uh. I can plug you in. Sounds good. A little sticky pad to stick on top of your uh television. And you just say something to into that and it finds your The other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of a remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into a voice control. So it could be sold to both the younger market and the older market. And the younger market could use kind of the voi voice control method and the older market might might k exactly and might consider the older market could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and what not. 'S definitely an option technically. I've looked into uh costs of uh touch screen methods and what not  they seem to be uh you know almost as cheap as a button method at this point. Um I'm not sure that's sincerely correct  I think if you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that uh trying to pass a portion of the device is not interchangeable whereas the surrounding portions are interchangeable. We could have the casing  the the face plates. Well hopefully some people have people coming t over to w to hang out at your house and most people have their televisions in the living room. Uh. Sure. Well have we confirmed that we're gonna go ahead with a uh touch screen um Interface? So these new lithium batteries they last twenty years even with the touch screen? Those new ones. Be interesting. We put fashion into electronics. Yeah. Uh I I'm I'm in agreement with that  I'm wondering how we're gonna get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device. I'm hoping for a subliminal maybe half a millisecond as it turns on. Mm-hmm. Well all you have to do is touch the screen and it automatically goes on. Yep. Goes into a sleep mode. I've put my files in the shared folder as well. Okay. Gotta plug you in. Very nice. For your first PowerPoint it's lovely. Fine. It needs  yeah. Cool. Looks like you're in okay. There you go. Right. Does that mean I'm up? I think so. Okay. Oh that would be perfect. Thank you. Slide show up and running. Or not. Uh. Oh there we go. Perfect. Okay. So this is me. Um basically I was looking through some marketing reports that we've got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort like watching a hundred people use T_V_ remotes and see what it is that they're using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they don't about their general T_V_ remote control practices. Um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time  everybody's used to using changing the channel  turning it on  using the volume  m the majority of the time that's all that's going on  the other functions happen  for some people they're important  but the primary uses are really really basic. Um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use  they're not using a lot of it  they don't need it  they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they don't know what to do with. And um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people  their the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it. And then they can't find it in the room. So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something  will really come into play with a lot of these people. Um there's also a survey about what they liked about remotes  and pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful  and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options. I don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically  that's up to the design people  but it is s something worth thinking about  especially since the younger demographic's obviously the one that's gonna keep growing  so if that's the direction we're headed in it's something to think about. Um but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice  which are the standards. So it's a good start for us. Need to unplug this? Need it back. There you go. Oh right. We're not catering to the pensioners of the world I don't think so. Right. Right. Uh. Right. Yeah. Oh. That could work. I like that. Yeah. Something very basic. Right. Is that only gonna be within our two hundred foot range then? Okay. Yeah. Mm. Yeah. K Yeah. True. Making it just an option? Yeah. Right. Are we still thinking about this screen sorry. Go ahead. The uh if we're gonna do this touch pad screen thing  it would be still  do we know if that's an option technically right now to that? Okay. Okay. We're doing okay. 'Cause it seems like an interesting option especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these you know four or five basic functions  you can have menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition  settings  things that you're not gonna use every day and that a lot of people aren't gonna use but it is an option there for this hi-tech market that sort of re is the sleek thing we're going for. True. Worth looking into. Yeah. True. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. Mm. Just the casing. Mm. Yeah. Right. Mm. Right. Well in the publicity of a face plate on a phone is you have it out and around  it is sort of emblematic whereas you're just sit at home  so unless somebody comes over to watch T_V_ True. True. True. Yeah. Oh yeah. True. 'Cause it would have a docking base? Yeah. Can we afford that? And will somebody buy it if we don't? Right. For twelve Euros? It is. Fair enough. The basics. Mm. 'Kay. Mm. And oh. Yeah the the fashion do. Yeah. Right  and then you're dealing with ports and cords and Yeah. For now. Yeah. Nice. Um. Well but if we're gonna use a touch screen where it's gonna come on like on your cell phone it'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading and then it goes away  perhaps it could be like a temporary Comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it 'cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something I think. Yeah. Y Yeah you would think. But. If it comes from above. Yeah. Mm. We're good? Yeah. ,The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting. The industrial designer presented options for batteries  materials and shapes to use for the case  buttons  and chips. The user interface designer discussed how to create an interface for an ergonomic remote which conforms to the shape and movements of the human hand  as well as an option in which users could connect their remotes to computers in order to download program settings. The marketing expert discussed findings from trendwatching reports  which indicated a need for products which look fancy  are technologically innovative  are easy to use  have a fruit and vegetable theme  and are spongy. The team then discussed what materials and components to use  the color of the remote  and programming options for the remote. 
Mm. You said uh targ target groups  what does that mean? Uh okay  'kay. So are Okay. Alright. I can go first  yeah. Right. Um so f from the Right sure. Uh okay. So n uh with uh with regard to the uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh I've identified um a few basic uh components of the remote and uh se uh from the design  functional design perspective um w I c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other. So this is the method that uh I'll mostly be following in my um in my uh role. Um the identification of the components  uh and uh since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects  I would need feedback from the marketing person uh and uh from the user interface person. Uh we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level and uh basically update and come up with a new design  so it's a cyclical process. Okay  so these were the basic findings from today. The last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email. Uh I just quickly jotted them down. Um so basically uh the as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it uh and what are the different processes um and how the parts uh communicate with each other. Um okay  so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated  so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control. Um also uh the remote control should be used only for television  because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex. And the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television. How however  our our remote control would only be dealing uh with the the use for television  in order to keep things simple. Um also the management wants that um our design should be unique uh it so it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard. Okay  so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control. Um there's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface. The user interf interface communicates with the chip  so I'll basic go over to the Okay. So if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell  uh it communicates uh it feeds energy into the into the chip  which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything. There is a user interface here. So whe when the user presses a button  it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal  um which then so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code  which is then communicated to the remote site  which h has an infrared receiver. Um the there can be uh a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating. Um so these are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control  whatever new functions that we need to do  um make the chip more complicated uh and bigger  basically. Okay. Um so i in my personal preferences um I'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible. This would uh help us uh to upgrade our technology at a future point of time. And uh also if we can incorporate uh the latest features in our chip design  so that our um uh remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most uh televisions. That's about it. So anything that you would like to know or No  I don't have any idea about what each component costs. Um yeah. Anything else? Yeah. Certainly  yeah. So so tha yeah  we definitely need to operate within our constraints  but um unfortunately I I do not have any data  so uh I just identified the functional components for that. Yeah  okay. Yeah. Mm 'kay. I it'll take some time. Oh  there it is  yeah. It'll come up  it um uh no signal. Yeah yeah  it says something now  adjusting Okay. Oh  that's strange. Okay. And one more time. Mm. Sorry  cou could you go back for a second? Uh switching on off channel  uh volume  okay  that's great. So in the u user interface requirements uh uh uh we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want. Um but um so so at this stage  uh how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or I mean in we can completely do away with buttons and uh have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that. But uh is is there any uh uh any thoughts on that? Right. Yeah  and it'll make the costs yeah. Right. Uh I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them. So well we can probably wait until t we have more knowledge on that. Uh i if the if the costs allow  we can have like an L_C_D_ display and uh with um because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well. So yeah? Cool. try to press oh  okay  yep. Mm. Right. Mm-hmm. Mm. Right. Mm-hmm. Hmm. Right. Mm. Mm. Mm. Some kind of a ring  some Right. Hmm. Okay  that's great  thanks. Mm. I think one of the very interesting things that came up in um uh Ka Kate Cat Cat's uh presentation was um uh this this issue of uh uh like voice recognition being more popular with uh younger people. So if we need to have a target group um then uh I think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned  if we want to have something sleek and uh you know  good looking uh we are better off targeting a younger audience then um you know  people who are comparatively elderly. Um. Right. Right. Bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them  so if you want to put in something stylish  then uh th it'll certainly be more popular with this i ye with the younger people as compared to older people  yeah. Right  and Right. Mm. Right. But uh still  if if you can go back to that slide and uh  how popular was it? Oh  oh  okay. That's alright  if you can just look it up on your computer  wh uh um people between twenty five to thirty five  uh how popular was so it was sti still still quite popular amongst them. So even they are seventy six percent  is that high amount? Alright. Yeah. So you're more likely to b Yeah. Yeah. Mm. Bu but even even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it's quite popular  right? So mm uh are are are Mm. Mm. Um I was having a a general outlook on um m most like sophisticated features  but voice recognition itself I'm not very sure about  because one of the p uh things that Cat pointed out was uh uh how do we go about implementing it? Uh and uh Yeah. But how frequently do we use it anyway and um uh h ho how good is it  you know uh voice recognition softwares are still quite uh Yeah. Right. Right. Okay. O Right. Mm. Right. Yeah. Okay  so it seems like a feasible thing to implement uh for for a limited yeah. Mm. W What uh Mm. What wh uh what I was thinking is that there is this uh separation between what the channels are on T_V_ and how they are numbered on the remote control. If we can do with away with that  our product can be really popular uh in the sense that uh a person can say  I want to watch uh I_T_V_ one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five. Yeah  so if uh if something like that can be incorporated  some kind of Mm-hmm. Alright. Yeah  that's Right. Mm. Mm yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control being cl I mean it'll it'll mm. Yeah. Mm. So uh wh another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button on the T_V_  so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control  wherever it is  it'll beep  so we we can probably come to know where it is. Right  yeah  yeah  yeah. Alright  yeah. Right. Okay. So where exactly is this i Ah  okay. Yeah. Yeah  yeah in that one  right yeah. No. Right. I guess I'll find out. Wha what was it again that I was supposed to look into? Con components  oh. Cool. Do you wanna give me the little cable thing? Yeah. Cool. Ah  that's why it won't meet. Okay  cool. Yep  cool. Okay  functional requirements. Alright  yeah. It's working. Cool  okay. So what I have  wh where I've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab um observed remote control use with um a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire. Um so it was all about  you know  how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control  you know. What's the most annoying things about remote controls and um the possibility of speech recognition and L_C_D_ screens in remote control. Not that they actually gave me any answers on the L_C_D_ screens  so I should have taken that bit out  but anyway. Um okay  so. What they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are  so you know  definitely you should be looking at something quite different. Um seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly. Uh the other twenty five percent have no fashion sense. Uh eighty percent of users would spend more to get um you know  a nice looking remote control. Um current remote controls  they don't match the user behaviour well  as you'll see on the next slide. Um I dunno what zapping is  but Oh  right. But you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what's on. Um okay  fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons  so that's going back to what  you know  we were saying earlier about  you know  do you need all the buttons on the remote control  they just make it look ugly. Okay? Cool. Um so this is my little graph thing. Mm k Okay  well  I can send it to all of you. What it is is um it's cones  'cause I thought they'd be more exciting. Um but ooh where's it go? Back. Oh. Oh yes  cool. Okay  I'm gonna stop playing with the little pointy thing. Um okay  so like what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection. What you can't see is volume selection  it's a little bit higher than all the others. Yeah  so what the graph shows is that  you know  power  channel selection and volume selection are important  and the rest of them  you know  nobody really uses and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like um their importance  you know  so on a scale of one to ten  how important is that and  you know  channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential  and the power  well it's not quite so essential  apparently  although I don't understand how it couldn't be  um and everything else  I think  you know  you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control  'cause they're just not needed  and they're not used. Okay. This is the bit that the email messed up for me and that's what I was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing. Okay  cool. So um okay  so this is what people find annoying about remote controls. Uh that they get lost  that the uh you know  they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury. I think if you're watching enough T_V_ to get repetitive strain injury from um you know  watching T_V_  then that's the least of your problems  but you know  it's up there. Um that yeah. Okay  so um I mean the the R_S_I_ thing would be that  like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control and you know  not straining your wrists watching T_V_. Yes. Okay  cool. Right  um sorry this is pink because I was copying and pasting the table  and I didn't have time to white it out again. Um okay  but that shows how people whether they would pay more for voice recognition software. So you can see from that that  you know  younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software  whereas as people get older  they're a bit more sceptical about it and they're less willing to to try it. Um so clearly voice recognition is something to think about  but um you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a T_V_  you know  tends to be people talking and um  you know  how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching T_V_. Um okay? Cool. Um okay  so these are my personal preferences. So you have sleek  stylish  sophisticated  you know  so something that's  you know  a bit cool. Um you know  functional  so it's useful  but minimalist. Um there's a there's an important thing that  you know  people use when  you know  when you're filling up your home  you know  a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap  basically  you know  and you've got all this stuff  and you're just like  what the hell is that  who is ever gonna use it? You know  so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both  so I think we need to aim for both. Um okay  then a long battery life  like you were talking about earlier and um  you know  I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because  you know  your remote control just sits there  and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit. Um and then like a locator  so you know  kind of like you have for a mobile phone or not a mobile phone Yeah  that's it  you know. I know  it's weird. My flatmate and I were talking about this on the way into uni this morning and I was like I need to get one for everything. So yeah  so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps  something a kind of sound that you don't often hear on the T_V_  you know  'cause you don't want your remote control beeping every five minutes  'cause you you'd then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window or something. So okay? Cool. That's me. Cat's. Ca. Yeah  I mean that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey  you know  whether  you know  these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control  but I'm assuming  you know  yes. Well  that's when you go to uni  isn't it? So  you know Yeah. Oh  I've unplugged it. Do you want me to Yeah. Seventy six point three percent. Yeah. Yeah  I kn I mean I know what you're saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds  but I mean it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income because they don't have like I mean  you know  if you're at university  you're paying your rent  but you don't have a mortgage  you don't have a life insurance policy  you don't normally have a car  yeah  so. You're still learning to drive actually  so that just costs more than a car  but yeah. Um so I mean like it is an age group to target  really  I think. No  I mean that's what  that's like fifteen Pounds? You know  I think Yeah  I d I don't know many people without a T_V_. We didn't have a T_V_ last year  and everyone thought we were off our heads  you know. Yeah  I d well we've we've got quite a d decent T_V_. Yeah. I think I think the fact that  you know  ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes  I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control  does say quite a lot really. You know  so I mean that and the disposable income and I don't think it's something to ignore  you know. Is not a massive difference  you know. No  do totally. You do have it in your mobile phone though  don't you? Because you have like I mean every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them. I don't know. Yeah. S so y you'd maybe need a code word. Do you know what I mean? So like when you say change  except that's being said quite a lot on T_V_  so maybe like  you know  remote. I mean how often do people say remote on T_V_? Although I only watch Charmed  so really I wouldn't know but like so you'd just say remote five  you know  remote ten  remote one two nine. I don't think there's a lot of uh voice recognition remote controls. Yeah  that would be another way to do it. Yeah  but then the code word would be even more important  because I mean Sky advertise on every channel  don't they  you know  so then it would be you'd be watching Charmed  and then the Sky advert would come on and it would change to Sky. Yeah  yeah  and that would be really annoying. Yeah. Do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on a remote control though? Yeah  you know  so you have to have the remote control. It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime  you can yell at it and it'll just change it  you can look for it later  yeah. Yeah  yeah  I suppose nearer to you but a b like if you have surround sound then Yeah. Yeah  'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control. Yeah  definitely  yeah. Oh  so y you want our um PowerPoint presentations in there  hey? Okay. There you go. But is everyone's called functional requirements? Okay  so that's good. That's me done. Okay  cool. All hooked up. Okay  so now we are here at the functional design meeting. Um hopefully this meeting I'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually. The agenda for the meeting  I put it in the sh shared documents folder. I don't know if that meant that you could see it or not. Did anyone? No. Oh well. Um I'll try and do that for the next meeting as well so if you check in there  there's a shared project documents folder. Um and it should be in there. Project documents  yeah. So I'll put it in there. Is it best if I send you an email maybe  to let you know it's there? Yep. I'll do that next time. Um I'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through  and then I'll send them to you after the meeting. The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time  so we'll go through each of you one by one. Um then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us. I just sent at the last minute  I'm sorry about that  but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing. Um and then we need to  by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things  target group and functions of the remote control. And we've got forty minutes to do that in. So I would say yeah? As uh who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to  yeah. So we need to yeah  we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on and then look at the functions um of the dem remote control itself. So with that I think it's best if I hand over to you. Does anyone have a preference for going first? You wanna go first? Okay  so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours. I assume we just pull it out? Just before you start  to make it easier  would you three mind emailing me your presentations? Once we you don't have to do it now but when once you go back  just so that I don't have to scribble everything down. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Okay. Do you have any um i idea about costs at this point? Br Okay. 'Cause that's something to consider  I guess  if we're if we're using more advanced technology  it might increase the price. Yeah. That's fine. Are there any more questions  or shall we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together at the end? Yeah  I think that will do. Okay  so do you want to Yes  shall shall we pull this up? I think that has to come out of there. Yeah. Yeah  I thought those last minute things  they're gonna hit you the worst. It ta takes a little Oh  and have you you need to then also press on yours  function F_ eight  so the blue function key at the bottom and F_ eight. Now it's coming  computer no signal. Maybe again? Okay  adjusting. There we go  there we go. Oh  if you press if you press function and that again there's there's usually three modes  one where it's only here  one where it's only there  and one where it's both. Okay  so one more time. Should yeah just wait for a moment  adjusting. Okay. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. If I mean that was the the directive that came through from management  but if we had a a decent case for that we really think it's important to include video and D_V_D_  I could get back to them and see. It's w it's just whether it's worth arguing about. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Okay. Are there any questions for clarification of Maarika before we go on to the next one? Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Mm-hmm. Sure  we can discuss that maybe after the next one. Do you want to yeah. Oh  I'm getting hungry. You set? Uh we need to do the function key thing so that it comes up on here. Hello. Is it plugged in prop it's working? Okay. Excellent. It's um switching between channels  sort of randomly going through. Mm. Ooh  that's a bit difficult to see. If you explain it to us it'll be fine. Yeah. I liked the  I liked the litt ooh come back. No. Okay. Mm-hmm  that's the next one along  yeah? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. The remote control. Mm-hmm. That's alright. Mm. Keys and things like that  yeah. Whistle and it screams at you  yeah. Mm-hmm. That's you  excellent. Um. I'm just gonna tick yes. So  we've got about ten  fifteen minutes to discuss Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Then again I guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket and the I don't know how often they're buying televisions. Yeah  but you don't have much money  generally. I would've thought it's it's more that twenty five to thirty five  when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their nice toys and O oh it's on sorry  we unplugged it. Here  let me Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah  they've got no commitments and usually not a car and all of those things. Kids. Yeah. Yeah  and if we're if we're talking twenty five Euros as a price  that's not unaffordable  even for young people. Yeah. Yeah. But do they But the T_V_s are often kind of someone's old T_V_ that's blah blah and be a bit strange to have a fancy rome remote. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah  if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five  but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition. Is that gonna have a an implication for the technical specs? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. With um but with a T_V_ remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five  louder  tha that should be relatively simple. Mm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah  but maybe if you wanna look into that just to just to check. Um  so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group and then of course we're going to get th anyone who's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money  then they'll they'll still go for the same advertising. Yeah  I think we need both. Yeah. Mm. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. So that if that was in the the voice recognition  that would be great. Yeah. Yeah. Watch Sky and yeah. Mm-hmm. But that's definitely a possibility. Yeah. So that you can yell at it  yeah. Yeah. Alright. Mm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. That's but then if you're buying the remote separately  but y you could have something  but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the T_V_ or something  some like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack  so one part attaches to the T_V_. The l Well that's right  but it solves the problem of having different noises. Yeah. Okay  I think we're gonna have to wrap this up um. But if we go away with that that kind of general um specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds  we want it to look simple  but still have the buttons so it's easy to use  but only those key buttons  the major buttons and then one sort of menu one  and then voice recognition included as an option um but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning um. What we have to do now is to go back to our little places  complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation  which y you'll get immediately by email. Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes  and then we've got a lunch break and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work. Um I'll put the minutes in that project documents folder  but I'll send you an email when I do it  so that you know. It should be on your desktop  so on the yeah. So I'll put it I'll put them there as soon as I've written them. Yeah  and email them round. Yeah  that would be great. Oh yeah  put them in there. Yeah  then you don't have to email them. No  they're all called something slightly different. Technical requirements and something something  yeah. So  if you put them in there  we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to. Um as to where we're going from here  you're going to look at the components concept. Yeah? Whatever that means. Yeah. You'll be looking you'll be looking at the user interface concept  on something conceptual and you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition'll fall off the map or something that um we'll keep keep our options op hmm? Components  yeah. No  we have we have after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare  so that's fine  w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary. Okay? Right on time. Okay  so you can I guess we'll see you for lunch in a sec? No. Mm. Um um wi on on a what? Oh project project documents  yeah  yeah  yeah  okay. Oh okay  yeah. Yes  I think so. Yeah  the last minute  yeah  yeah. Yeah. Um Okay. Hmm. Mm. Okay  yeah  afterwards  yeah  okay. Thanks. I think we need like some general discussion at the end probably. Yeah. Yeah  I think since since we were discussing some um design issues then I I I would like to continue okay  yeah. Thanks. Oh i Okay  I hope wait. Should it just There's just nothing. Oh right  right  right  um Okay. Nothin okay  something is coming up. No signal? Why? Oh. My my computer went blank now. Adjusting. But I don't see anything I don't see anything on my computer now. This is the problem  but Um. Uh now it's okay. No? No. Oh okay. Okay  that's fine  that's good. Okay  let's start from the beginning. So I'm going to speak about technical functions design uh just like some some first issues that came up. Um 'kay  so the method I was um adopting at this point  it's not um for the for the whole um period of the um all the project but it's just at th at this very moment. Um uh my method was um to look at um other um remote controls  uh so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what um functionality they used. And then um after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web um just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what um what the user might desire as additional uh functionalities. And yeah  and then just to um put the main function of the remote control in in words. Um so the findings uh were um that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set  so this quite straightforward. And uh w some of the main functions would be switching on  switching off  uh then the user would like to switch the channel um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels  or then mm uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel  so we would need the numbers. And and also the volume is very important. Um um I als okay. 'Kay. Um um among the findings I found that m m most of the curr mm presently available remote controls also include other mm functionalities um in their design  like operating a V_C_R_  but they don't seem to be able to deal with D_V_D_ players  but then there are surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them  but according to the last minute update um actually um we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design. So my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size. And then it must be easy to use  so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something. Um then yeah  the must-have buttons would be on off and then the channel numbers and then um the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel  and then volume has to be there. But then um other functionalities um could be just uh there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then  um for example brightness and mm similar functions could be just um done through the menu. And yeah  the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n uh more functionalities  the answer was already no because of the last minute update. So at the for the time being that's uh that's all. If you have questions Yeah  and also it's it's um other question is uh because there are so many different And there are so many different things that could possibly be included because besides video and D_V_D_ there are the mm um video C_D_s and whatever  so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things. Um well  I think the buttons are still mm kind of the most um easy for the user to use  I mean um what other options would you have? A little screen or something  but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user and and I mean the user just wants to get um get a result um quickly  not to spend time in like um giving several orders um I dunno. I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons  but if if you have other mm proposals um. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yep. Uh am I going in the right direction? No. Wait. Okay  here it comes. Okay  here you are. Um that's very good  very interesting. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah  you share a television or something that yeah. It was seventy something  yeah  yeah. Yeah this this is not unaffordable  but the problem is whether people need it  whether they do have a T_V_ to use its full Yeah. Common  the students yeah  yeah. The s the stu yeah  and the remote control might not yeah  it might not even function with the old T_V_. Yeah  we're still yeah. Or w maybe we can just kind of uh uh Yeah  but at the same time I think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target  because actually I mean they're all still re young people. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. An Yeah. Yeah. Yeah but uh um Yeah  yeah sure  yeah  yeah. Yeah. Yeah  w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons  but I think this is not really the right moment yet  because people are just so used to buttons and um  yeah it's it's kind of safer  so we we need both  so the voice recognition would be just an extra  it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote. Yeah but m but on the other hand  remote control isn't as close to you you probably might just just uh speak into it and and the T_V_ would be already further away  so it might not pick up the other things coming from there. Yeah  but then the remote control I think I mean um the idea is kind of it's it's not that it's sitting there on on top of the television  because then you could already yell at the television and you wouldn't you you wouldn't need the remote control  so the remote control is still something you keep n near yourself. Yeah  yeah  yeah. No  but I I I was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us  a and uh not to yell at it from the distance. Okay. Oh yeah  yeah. Okay  yeah  mm-hmm. The major ones  yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Did you find it? It's just yeah  yeah. Oh so so we'll just put them i there  we we yeah  w we won't even okay. Yeah. Yeah. Uh something conceptual  yeah. Hmm. Sorry  but um the next meeting um are we going to have it um right after lunch or shall we prepare our To prepare  okay  yeah  that's good. Okay. Cool. Okay  see you. ,The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team and then the team members participated in an exercise in which they drew their favorite animals and discussed why they liked those particular animals. The project manager discussed the project finances and the team engaged in a brainstorming session about various features to consider in designing a remote. The project manager then further discussed the roles of the team members.
